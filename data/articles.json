      "summary": "We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk."

      "summary": "The precise arrangement of different chemical moieties in a polymer determines its thermophysical properties. How the sequence of moieties impacts the properties of a polymer is an outstanding problem in polymer science. Herein, we address this problem for the thermoresponsive property of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) in water using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Eight distinct copolymers, each with a different arrangement of NIPAM(N-isopropylacrylamide) and AM (acrylamide) monomers, are considered. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) shows a strong correlation with the mean block length of the periodic sequences of the copolymer. We further identify copolymer sequences that exhibit both the LCST and upper critical solution temperature (UCST). Moreover, there are sequences that do not show any LCST or UCST for the temperature range explored in this study. This wide variability in thermorepsonsive property is found to be closely linked to the the extent of hydrongen bond formation in the system, which appears to have a significant correlation with the monomer sequence of the copolymer. These findings offer new directions in the design of structurally diverse thermoresponsive copolymers."

For continuous-time Markov jump processes and overdamped diffusions governed by Fokker--Planck equations, we prove the inequality $ \\frac{2 V(t)^2}{A(t)} \\leq \\dot{e}_p(t), $ linking the squared net velocity $V(t)$, entropy production rate $\\dot{e}_p(t)$, and dynamical activity $A(t)$. This relation captures a fundamental trade-off between transport, dissipation, and fluctuation intensity, valid far from equilibrium and without detailed balance. In addition, we introduce dimensionless thermodynamic ratios that quantify dissipation asymmetry, entropy extraction, and relaxation. These scaling laws unify discrete and continuous stochastic thermodynamics and provide experimentally accessible constraints on transport efficiency in nanoscale machines and active systems."

Using homogeneous parton mean field theory, we find that the stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for Kitaev coupling $K>0$ and the ferromagnetic (FM) order for $K 0$ model features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping for $K > 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter $K_{\\rm sc} < 1$. Our work sets the stage for a broader exploration of doping effects in triangular lattice magnets such as NaRuO$_2$ which feature bond-dependent exchange interactions."

      "summary": "Algebraic/Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of critical quantum ground states that do not have a quasi-particle description. DSLs and related spin liquid phases often arise in strongly frustrated quantum spin systems, in which strong correlations and quantum fluctuations among constituent spins persist down to zero temperature. In this work, we analyze Mott insulating phases of $SU(3)$ fermions on a kagome lattice which may realize a DSL phase, described at low energies by $(2 + 1)d$ quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with $N_f=6$ Dirac fermions. By analyzing the action of physical symmetries on the operators of the QED$_3$ theory, we conclude that the low energy DSL is a quantum critical point that can be accessed by tuning a single microscopic parameter. Aided by the emergent symmetry and anomalies of the low energy effective theory, we conjecture and present supporting arguments that the $SU(3)$ Kagome magnet DSL is an unnecessary quantum critical point, lying completely within a single phase."

Here, this analysis is extended, focusing on the effect of electron-electron correlations in the monolayer on the electronic response to the ion. We apply the recently developed time-linear G1-G2 scheme [Schluenzen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 076601 (2020)] combined with an embedding approach [Balzer et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 155141 (2023)]. We demonstrate that, while electronic correlations have a minor effect in graphene, they significantly influence the electron dynamics in the case of MoS2. Our key results are the ultrafast dynamics of the charge density and induced electrostatic potential in the vicinity of the impact point of the ion."

      "summary": "Thin metal film on Germanium, in the presence of water, results in a remarkable pattern forming system. Here we present an analysis of spirals spontaneously etched on the Ge surface. We obtain measurements of the growth dynamics of the spirals and measurements of the local strain field in the metal film. Both indicate that the near geometric order of the pattern originates from the unique far field of a singularity - a crystal defect. The measured engraving profile is found in quantitative agreement with a model of metal catalyzed corrosion of the Ge surface. Specifically, local etch depth is inversely proportional to the normal velocity of the Ge-metal contact line. The growth mechanism combines crack propagation, reaction diffusion dynamics, and thin film mechanical instabilities, and illustrates how a defect's long range field can impose geometric order in a non-equilibrium growth process. General features relevant to other pattern forming systems are the coupling of chemistry and mechanics and the singularity driven order."

By precisely modulating the vertical arrangement of Zr and Al dopants during atomic layer deposition, we introduce deliberate compositional gradients that affect crystallization dynamics during subsequent annealing. This strategy enables us to systematically tune the phase evolution and domain nucleation within the ferroelectric layer, directly influencing device reliability and performance. From a structural perspective, our findings demonstrate that the phase composition of annealed HfO$_2$ films in MFIS stacks is primarily determined by the spatial arrangement of dopants. From an electrical perspective, we observe significant enhancement of remanent polarization and endurance of the gate stacks through heterogeneous co-doping, depending on the spatial arrangement of dopants."

Here, we enable subsequent reactions on Si(100) through selectively adsorbing 3D, silicon-specific \"molecular tools\". Following an activation step, the molecules present an out-of-plane radical that can function both to donate or accept molecular fragments, thereby enabling applications across multiple scales, e.g., macroscale customizable silicon-carbon coatings or nanoscale tip-mediated mechanosynthesis. Creation of many such molecular tools is enabled by broad molecular design criteria that facilitate reproducibility, surface specificity, and experimental verifiability. These criteria are demonstrated using a model molecular tool tetrakis(iodomethyl)germane ($Ge(CH_{2}I)_{4}$; TIMe-Ge), with experimental validation by SPM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and theoretical support by density functional theory (DFT) investigations. With this framework, a broad and diverse range of new molecular engineering capabilities are enabled on silicon."

In this work, we highlight that this perspective overlooks intrinsic heterogeneities in interatomic spacing that decisively shape defect properties. We analyze excess free volume, energy, and entropy for a large set of BCC-Fe grain boundaries relaxed by molecular statics and demonstrate that an atomic-density field, as a systematically coarse-grained field variable, provides a more comprehensive descriptor. Unlike coordination alone, the density field simultaneously captures bond depletion and spacing variations, thereby unifying structural and volumetric information. Our results establish density-based descriptors as principled surrogates for grain-boundary thermodynamics and kinetics, offer a direct bridge from atomistic data to mesoscale models, and motivate augmenting broken-bond rules in predictive theories of interfacial energetics, excess properties, segregation and phase behavior."

      "summary": "We study an information engine operating in an active bath, where a Brownian particle confined in a harmonic trap undergoes feedback-driven displacement cycles. Unlike thermal environments, active baths exhibit temporally correlated fluctuations, introducing memory effects that challenge conventional feedback strategies. Extending the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to account for such memory, we analyze a feedback protocol that periodically shifts the potential minimum based on noisy measurements of the particle's position. We show that conventional feedback schemes, optimized for memoryless thermal baths, can degrade performance in active media due to the disruption of bath-particle memory by abrupt resetting. To overcome this degradation, we introduce a class of memory-preserving feedback protocols that partially retain the covariance between the particle's displacement and active noise, thereby exploiting the temporal persistence of active fluctuations. Through asymptotic analysis, we show how the feedback gain -- which quantifies the strength of positional shifts -- nontrivially shapes the engine's work and power profiles. In particular, we demonstrate that in active media, intermediate gains outperform full-shift resetting. Our results reveal the critical interplay between bath memory, measurement noise, and feedback gain, offering guiding principles for designing high-performance information engines in nonequilibrium environments."

Identifying the general physical principles that govern these behaviors is essential for advancing their potential in spintronic applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory with atomistic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the magnetic ground states, finite-temperature magnetic transitions, and electronic structures of fully-ordered $L2_1$-, $XA$-type, and partially-ordered V$_2X$Al ($X=$ Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Heusler alloys. We introduce the concept of magnetic genes, defined as V-$X$-V triangular motifs connected by the nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interactions $J_{\\mathrm{V-}X}$. Within this framework, the magnetic ground states and transition temperatures across the V$_2X$Al family can be consistently understood. The magnetic order is primarily governed by the NN $J_{\\mathrm{V-}X}$ interactions in the triangular genes, while the transition temperatures are additionally influenced by $J_{X-X}$ couplings. Furthermore, the magnetic genes are still proven to be effective in our calculations on partially-ordered V$_2$$X$Al alloys from $L2_1$ to $XA$-type structures. Our results suggest that the concept of magnetic genes provides a unifying principle for understanding magnetic ordering in V-based Heusler alloys and could serve as a powerful guide for exploring magnetism and designing advanced spintronic materials in a broader class of Heusler systems."

In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) 1T-TaS2/TaSe2, experiments reveal rich temperature- and pressure-dependent CDW phase behaviors, along with metastable CDW states induced by ultrafast optical excitation. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms governing thermal/pressure-driven transitions and particularly the microscopic evolution of CDW phases remain incompletely understood. Here, we perform first-principles anharmonic phonon calculations and machine-learning force-field molecular dynamics at finite temperatures/pressures to investigate the CDW transitions in 1T-TaS2/TaSe2. The calculated CDW transition temperature TCDW and critical pressure Pc are in quantitative agreement with experimental values. Our results demonstrate that the melting of CDW originates from phonon anharmonicity, with ionic fluctuations dominating the transition dynamics. We observe the microscopic evolution of CDW under varying temperature/pressure, revealing an ultrafast nucleation process of CDW (~3 ps). Our results emphasize the essential role of phonon anharmonicity in elucidating CDW transition mechanisms underlying, and advance fundamental understanding of CDW-related phenomena in TMDs."

The gated section locally widens an energy gap and mediates the coupling between the quantum anomalous Hall states of the leads and the chiral Majorana states of the proximitized sector. Local and non-local conductances offer measurable hints of the existence of transport mediated by chiral Majorana modes. Local conductances on the two leads reveal characteristic oscillatory patterns as a function of the gating strength, with peculiar correlations depending on the distance between gated and proximitized sectors. A gate tunable Majorana diode effect on nonlocal conductances emerges when the chemical potential deviates from zero. We suggest a protocol to identify chiral Majorana physics based on a sequence of electrostatic gates that allows the tuning of chiral Majorana interference."

Here, we realize a particle-exchange quantum heat engine based on a single diradical molecule, only a few nanometers in size. We experimentally investigate its operation at low temperatures and demonstrate that both the power output and efficiency are significantly enhanced by Kondo correlations, reaching up to 53 % of the Curzon-Ahlborn limit. These results establish molecular-scale particle-exchange engines as promising candidates for low-temperature applications where extreme miniaturization and energy efficiency are paramount."

      "summary": "We introduce an analytic slave boson method for treating the finite $U$ Anderson impurity model. Our approach introduces two bosons to track both $Q\\rightleftharpoons Q\\pm1$ valence fluctuations and reduces to a single symmetric $s$-boson in the effective action, encoding all the high energy atomic physics information in the boson's kinematics, while the low energy part of the action remains unchanged across finite $U$, infinite $U$, and Kondo limits. We recover the infinite $U$ and Kondo limit actions from our approach and show that the Kondo resonance already develops in the normal state when the slave boson has yet to condense. We show that the slave rotor and $s$-boson have the same algebraic structure, and we establish a unified functional integral framework connecting the $s$-boson and slave rotor representations for the single impurity Anderson model."

      "summary": "Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing."

      "summary": "In general, the cross-slip of superdislocations (a/2 ) from {111} planes to {001} planes has been frequently observed in superalloys, accompanied by the formation of an antiphase boundary (APB) and driven by thermal activation. However, no prior studies have evidenced the occurrence of Shockley partial dislocation (a/6 ) cross-slip within the gamma prime phase of superalloys. In this work, we present a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon: the Shockley partial dislocations cross-slip from one {111} plane to another {111} conjugate plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation in the ordered gamma prime phase of a CoNi-based superalloy. Compression tests were conducted at 850 degrees Celsius with a strain rate of 10^-4 s^-1. Defects such as stacking faults and dislocations, along with the associated chemical fluctuations, were characterized using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy required for cross-slip by decreasing the energies of stacking faults and dislocations. In addition to elemental segregation, local stress concentrations, arising from the combined effects of applied stress, shearing dislocations within the gamma prime phase, and dislocation pile-ups, also play a critical role in triggering cross-slip. The formation of sessile stair-rod dislocations via this newly identified Shockley partial cross-slip in the gamma prime phase is beneficial for enhancing the high-temperature deformation resistance of the alloy by increasing the critical resolved shear stress required for further plastic deformation."

Conventional approaches for disordered materials involve sampling from thermodynamic ensembles and hoping for an experimental match. This process is inefficient and offers no guarantee of success. We present a method based on modified molecular dynamics, that we call molecular augmented dynamics (MAD), which identifies structures that simultaneously match multiple experimental observables and exhibit low energies as described by a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) trained from ab-initio data. We demonstrate its feasibility by finding representative structures of glassy carbon, nanoporous carbon, ta-C, a-C:D and a-CO$_x$ that match their respective experimental observables -- X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, pair distribution function and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data -- using the same initial structure and underlying MLP. The method is general, accepting any experimental observable whose simulated counterpart can be cast as a function of differentiable atomic descriptors. This method enables a computational \"microscope\" into experimental structures."

      "summary": "In many viruses, hundreds of proteins assemble an outer shell (capsid) around the viral nucleic acid to form an infectious virion. How the assembly process selects the viral genome amidst a vast excess of diverse cellular nucleic acids is poorly understood. It has recently been discovered that many viruses perform assembly and genome packaging within liquid-liquid phase separated biomolecular condensates inside the host cell. However, the role of condensates in genome packaging is poorly understood. Here, we construct equilibrium and dynamical rate equation models for condensate-coupled assembly and genome packaging. We show that when the viral genome and capsid proteins favorably partition into the condensate, assembly rates, yields, and packaging efficiencies can increase by orders of magnitude. Selectivity is further enhanced by the condensate when capsid proteins are translated during assembly and packaging. Our results suggest that viral condensates provide a mechanism to ensure robust and highly selective assembly of virions around viral genomes. More broadly, our results may apply to other types of selective co-assembly processes that occur within biomolecular condensates, and suggest that liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates could be exploited for selective encapsulation of microscopic cargo in human-engineered systems."

Using the transfer matrix method, we systematically analyze how different cone tilts affect Dirac fermion transmission. In reciprocal space, at fixed energy, the Dirac cones of distinct regions generate isoenergetic conical surfaces (Fermi surfaces). When these surfaces overlap, their intersections define ``active surfaces'' that enable fermion transmission. In the symmetric double-barrier configuration, coupling between the barriers and the central well gives rise to multiple resonance peaks, including line-type resonances, even within nominally forbidden energy zones. The number and positions of these resonances depend sensitively on the system parameters. These findings provide new insights into the role of Dirac cone tilt in complex junctions and may guide the design of nanoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional tilted-cone materials such as $\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ and borophene."

The materials are dynamically stable bipolar magnetic semiconductors. Among the magnetic semiconductors, NbSe2 showed the maximum Curie temperature of 176.25 K. For these materials, the ferromagnetic state was more favorable than the antiferromagnetic state, indicating robust ferrovalley characteristics. These ferrovalley materials showed a giant tunable valley polarization at K and K' points in the Brillouin zone without applying any external factors due to intrinsic exchange interactions of transition metal d-orbital electrons and spin-orbit coupling. TaTe2 exhibited an outstanding valley splitting of 541 meV. Reversing Bloch electrons' magnetic moment caused an alteration of valley polarization. Additionally, the application of uniaxial and biaxial strain led to the manipulation and variation of the bandgap and valley polarization. Berry curvature exhibited opposite signs and unequal magnitudes at K and K' points, which led to the anomalous valley Hall effect in these materials. NbS2, NbSe2, and NbTe2 exhibited Berry curvature at unstrained crystals, whereas Berry curvature appeared only in TaSe2 and TaTe2 with the application of strain. These ferrovalley materials exhibited distinct band gaps for spin-up and spin-down electrons, enabling the selective transport of spin-polarized electrons."

      "summary": "Achieving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism in purely organic 2D crystals remains a fundamental challenge, primarily due to antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling mediated by {\\pi}-electron superexchange. Here, we present a mix-topology design strategy to induce strong ferromagnetic (FM) coupling in metal-free 2D systems. By covalently connecting radical polyaromatic hydrocarbon monomers (also referred to as nanographenes) with distinct sublattice topologies, this approach rationally breaks inversion symmetry and enables selective alignment of majority spins across the extended network, giving rise to metal-free ferromagnetism. Based on this strategy, we designed a family of 32 organic 2D crystals featuring spin-1/2 and mixed spin-1/2-spin-1 honeycomb lattices. Systematic first-principles calculations reveal that these materials are robust FM semiconductors with tunable spin-dependent bandgaps ranging from 0.9 to 3.8 eV. Notably, we demonstrate record-high magnetic coupling of up to 127 meV, spin-splitting energies exceeding 2 eV, and Curie temperatures surpassing 550 K, indicating thermal stability well above room temperature. The microscopic origin of the strong FM exchange stems from enhanced spin-orbital overlap and dominant direct exchange, while AFM superexchange is effectively suppressed. Our findings establish a generalizable design principle for realizing robust metal-free FM semiconductors and open new avenues for developing flexible and biocompatible magnets for next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies."

This virtue makes them good candidates to investigate higher-order carrier dynamics, allowing to extract important excitonic properties, such as biexciton and triexciton binding energies that highly influence applications involving high excitation fluxes. Here, we explore triexciton emission, emanating from single core/shell CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets. We apply heralded post-selection of photon triplets using an advanced home-built single-photon spectrometer in order to resolve the triexciton$-$biexciton$-$exciton$-$ground state cascaded relaxation both in time and spectrum, and unambiguously determine the triexciton relaxation route and interaction nature. The results show a characteristic blue shift of the biexciton and triexciton, pointing to repulsive multiexciton interaction in the nanoplatelets under study. The relatively small measured energy shift of the triexciton (5.9 $\\pm$ 0.7 meV) indicates that it recombines through the 1S bands rather than the 1P bands, in agreement with findings on other colloidal quantum dot systems. Most importantly, the strong correlation between the biexciton and triexciton binding energies, and the ability to tune them via control of the particle dimensions and composition, paves the way for developing emitters of nearly degenerate photon triplets."

Here we resolve this discrepancy by revealing the critical but previously overlooked role of electron-phonon coupling in driving the topological phase transition. Using our newly developed ab initio framework for phonon-induced band renormalization, we show that thermal phonons alone drive $\\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ from the strong TI predicted by static-lattice calculations to a weak TI above ~180 K. At temperatures where $\\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ is stable, it is a weak TI with calculated surface states closely match experimental results, thereby reconciling theory with experiment.

We employ large-scale matrix product state simulations optimized for GPUs to obtain high-resolution dynamical responses. Our calculations reveal the spectral features across both ordered and liquid regimes of the phase diagram, which we analyze in comparison with analytical predictions and field-theoretical approaches. We identify unique signatures of the ordered phases in the form of gapless Goldstone modes at the ordering wave vectors. Our results in the $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin-liquid regime are indicative of a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. In the chiral spin-liquid phase, we find signatures of spinons as the fractional excitations of the underlying theory, manifested as the onset of a two-spinon continuum that agrees with predictions from the Kalmeyer-Laughlin ansatz for the ground-state wave function, and collective modes that can be viewed as spinon bound states. We discuss finite-size effects, their consistency with the presumptions from field-theory, and review the dynamical structure factor with regard to experimentally relevant features such as the occurrence of highly dispersive signals and the global distribution of spectral weight."

However, the interplay between its multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in governing multiple superconducting gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the superconducting gap of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals strongly couple to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the kagome-plane Sb-5pz orbital weakly interacts with Cs shearing phonon mode. Moreover, our calculations reveal EPC-induced band renormalization, manifested as kinks at approximately -13 meV and -30 meV in the electronic dispersion, consistent with prior experimental observations. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5."

The [Pt0.75Ti0.25/(Co/Ni)3/Ta]n superlattice also exhibits deterministic, low-current-density magnetization switching despite the very large layer thicknesses. The combination of the strong spin-orbit torque, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and low-current-density switching makes the [Pt0.75Ti0.25/Co-Ni multilayer/Ta]n superlattice a compelling material candidate for ultrafast, energy-efficient, long-data-retention spintronic technologies."

      "summary": "Kagome materials have attracted extensive attention due to their correlated properties. The breathing kagome material system Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) is regarded as a Mott insulator. However, studies on the influence of interlayer coupling on its magnetic and Mott properties are lacking. In this work, we investigated the effect of interlayer coupling on bilayer properties of each Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) compound via density functional theory (DFT) calculations, considering 24 stacking configurations per material. We found that each bilayer material is a Mott insulator. Due to the competition between interlayer Pauli repulsion and hopping, most interlayer magnetism is AFM, a small number of cases show AFM-FM degeneracy, and the magnetic ground state of 3 configurations is interlayer FM, i.e., tunable interlayer magnetism occurs. This robustness of Mott states coexisting with tunable interlayer magnetism provide novel and comprehensive analysis and insights for the research of breathing kagome Mott insulators."

      "summary": "Motivated by recent experiments on multiterminal Josephson junctions (MJJs) that probe different ranges of the size and bias voltage parameters, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) cross-over diagram to map the relationship between device dimension (x-axis) and bias voltage (y-axis). This cross-over diagram conveniently separates the different physical regimes of the devices. This framework is used to explore the regime of increasing bias voltage in large-scale devices near the x-axis, where the electrochemical potential becomes comparable to the 1D energy level spacing. In a perfect waveguide geometry, we find that the relative number of quantum-correlated pairs formed by colliding Floquet-Kulik levels is equal to the inverse of the number of transverse channels, due to the number of conserved quantities equal to the number of channels. This observation motivates a model for the intermediate regime in which the ballistic central two-dimensional normal metal is treated as a continuum under the adiabatic approximation, while Andreev modes propagate in a background of voltage- and flux-tunable nonequilibrium electronic populations. The model predicts characteristic voltage scales that govern the mesoscopic oscillations of the critical current, and these scales are at the crossroads of interpreting experiments in all sectors of the MJJs: quartets, topology, and Floquet theory."

      "summary": "The dynamics of bosons in curved geometries have recently attracted significant interest in quantum many-body physics. Leveraging recent experimental advances in tailored trapping landscapes, we investigate the quantum transport of weakly interacting bosons in two-dimensional bent trapping potentials, showing that geometry alone can serve as a precise control knob for tunneling dynamics. Using time-adaptive many-body simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis and exact diagonalization, we analyze both static and dynamical properties of bosons confined in the bent potential. We reveal how bending an initially straight channel induces a transition from density localization to delocalization and drives the buildup of correlations in the ground state. In the dynamics, the bent acts as a tunable barrier that enables controllable tunneling: weak curvature allows coherent tunnelling across the bend, while stronger bent suppresses transport and enhances self-trapping. The tunneling rate can be precisely tuned by geometric parameters, establishing bent traps as versatile platforms for geometry-controlled quantum transport."

These structures emerged from first-principles crystal structure prediction at 50 GPa, as part of a pressure-quenching strategy to discover superconductors that could be synthesized under pressure and retained at ambient conditions. The resulting structures are thermodynamically competitive, dynamically stable at zero pressure, and - when $X$ is a mono- or trivalent element - metallic and superconducting. Predicted critical temperatures reach up to 42 K for CsB$_{12}$, rivaling MgB$_2$, the highest-$T_c$ ambient-pressure conventional superconductor. We interpret the XB$_{12}$ phase as a superatomic crystal: the B$_{12}$ units retain their molecular identity while forming extended crystalline networks. Their delocalized orbitals support doping without structural destabilization, while their covalent bonding promotes strong electron-phonon coupling. Unlike MgB$_2$, where superconductivity is driven by a narrow subset of phonon modes, the XB$_{12}$ compounds exhibit broad, mode- and momentum-distributed coupling through both intra- and inter-superatomic vibrations. Our results highlight the XB$_{12}$ family as a promising platform for metastable superconductivity and demonstrate the potential of superatoms as functional building blocks in solid-state materials design."

At 100 mTorr, gated intensified charge-coupled device imaging and ion probe measurements showed that the plasma plume responsible for crystal growth initially comprised three components, with distinct expansion velocities. Plume interactions with the substrate heater and ablation target gave rise to complex dynamics, including collisions between the charged leading edge -- rebounding between the substrate and the target -- and slower-moving species in the plume interior. Film growth was dominated by species with kinetic energies $\\le$0.5 eV/atom. X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy revealed that films grown in this environment -- with a substrate temperature of 350$^\\circ$C, a laser fluence of 1.0 J cm$^{-2}$, and a 7.5 mm$^2$ spot area -- formed a porous framework with 15% porosity and pore sizes below 100 nm. X-ray diffraction indicated that the porous films were epitaxial with respect to the substrate and likely grew by oriented-attachment of gas-phase molecular clusters or very small nanoparticles, in contrast to the conventional epitaxy of vacuum films from atomic constituents. The in-plane orientation of the mesoporous films was $\\beta$-FeSe[100]$\\parallel$[110]MgO, attributed to the soft landing of pre-formed crystallites on the MgO substrates, where protruding Se rows of $\\beta$-FeSe aligned with corrugations of the MgO surface. This work implies that growth of candidate electrocatalyst materials by PLD in inert gas background may allow mesoporous frameworks with a single crystallographic orientation that expose specific crystal facets for electrochemical reactions and active site engineering."

Recently, Zhou et al. proposed the kagome-type IAMX family, which exhibits distinctive ideal topological states; however, their analysis is primarily restricted to the spinless approximation. In this work, we model relativistic effects in the IAMX family, demonstrating that tuning the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength drives topological phase transitions and induces novel topological states, resulting in a rich phase diagram. The configuration of topological surface states evolves continuously as the SOC strength is modulated, consistent with the evolution of the topological phase transition. This suggests a viable route toward designing multi-functional topological devices. First-principles calculations performed on three specific IAMX compounds confirm that SOC governs their topological phases, in complete accord with our model analysis."

These transitions can be described in a partonic framework as a cascade of mass changes of four neutral Dirac fermions coupled to multiple Abelian Chern-Simons $U(1)$ gauge fields. In the absence of fine-tuning, the transition is split into a series of four or more different transitions, with at least three distinct intermediate topologically ordered phases hosting neutral anyons."

The work presents a high-throughput first-principles discovery of two-dimensional (2D) type-II van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) optimized for visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting. We screened 482 heterostructures constructed from 60 experimentally realizable 2D monolayers and identified 148 stable type-II vdWHs with spatially separated valence and conduction band edges, out of which 65 satisfy the thermodynamic redox conditions for water splitting over a broad pH range. Among these, the best two, MoTe2/Tl2O and MoSe2/WSe2, exhibit a high visible-light absorption coefficient exceeding 0.6X10^6 cm-1, resulting in a high power conversion efficiency of 2%. Quantum kinetic analysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reveals nearly barrierless free energy profiles across multiple adsorption sites. Our study further reveals that intrinsic interlayer electric fields in these vdWHs drive directional charge separation, suppressing carrier recombination. Our results establish a design framework for using type-II 2D heterostructures as tunable and experimentally accessible 2D photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production."

We consider both the models with the retardation (Eliashberg mechanism of SC for strong electron-phonon interaction in metallic hydrogen) and without retardation (but with local onsite attraction). We concentrate on the mechanism of the BCS-BEC crossover for the Hubbard model with local attraction and diagonal disorder for the two-dimensional films of the dirty metal. We analyze also the model of the inhomogeneous spaceseparated Fermi-Bose mixture for the bismuth oxides BaKBiO, which contains the paired clusters of bosonic states as well as unpaired fermionic clusters. Superconductivity is realized in this system due to local pairs tunneling from one bosonic cluster to the neighboring one via the fermionic barrier. For metallic hydrogen and metallic hydrides, we calculate the critical temperature and discuss important possibility for practical applications how to increase the temperature by decreasing pressure in the framework of the generalized Eliashberg approach. We advocate also interesting analogies with the quantum (vortex) crystal for long-living low-dimensional metastable phases of metallic hydrogen including filamentous phase with proton chains embedded in 3D electron Fermi liquid and planar phase with proton plains. We formulate the concept of two Bose-condensates in SC electron and superfluid (SF) ion subsystems and provide the estimate for the lifetime of the long-living metastable phases at normal pressure. The estimate is connected with the formation and growth of the critical seeds of the new (molecular) phase in the process of quantum under-barrier tunneling."

The Hartree-Fock method is straightforward in the fermionic domain and may provide a reasonable approximation to the ground state. Correlation with respect to the fermionic mean-field can be recovered based on Lie-algebraic similarity transformation (LAST) with two-body correlators. Specifically, a unitary LAST variant eliminates the dependence on site ordering, while a non-unitary LAST yields size-extensive correlation energies. Whereas the first recent demonstration of such methods was restricted to small spin systems, we present efficient implementations using analytical gradients for the optimization with respect to the mean-field reference and the LAST parameters, thereby enabling the treatment of larger clusters, including systems with local spins s > 1/2."

Here, we demonstrate that mechanical strain fields contain sufficient information to reconstruct hidden chemical kinetics in coupled chemomechanical systems. Our partial differential equation-constrained learning framework decodes concentration-dependent diffusion kinetics, thermodynamic driving forces, and spatially heterogeneous reaction rates solely from mechanical observations. Using battery electrode materials as a model system, we demonstrate that the framework can accurately identify complex constitutive laws governing three distinct scenarios: classical Fickian diffusion, spinodal decomposition with pattern formation, and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions with spatial rate variations. The approach demonstrates robustness while maintaining accuracy with limited spatial data and reasonable experimental noise levels. Most significantly, the framework simultaneously infers multiple fundamental processes and properties, including diffusivity, reaction kinetics, chemical potential, and spatial heterogeneity maps, all from mechanical information alone. This method establishes a paradigm for materials characterization, enabling accurate learning of chemical processes in energy storage systems, catalysts, and phase-change materials where conventional diagnostics prove difficult. By revealing that mechanical deformation patterns serve as information-rich fingerprints of the underlying chemical processes, this work follows the pathway of inversely learning constitutive laws, with broad implications in materials science and engineering."

      "summary": "Understanding universal behavior of far-from-equilibrium transport dynamics at a quantum many body level is a longstanding challenge. In particular, a full characterization of universal dynamics of nonlocal correlation functions still remains largely unknown. In this letter, we uncover universal scaling laws of higher-order cumulants in one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, revealing anomalous behaviors of nonequilibrium dynamics exclusively accessible in higher-order correlations. By means of numerical simulations and full counting statistics, we determine the power laws of both the spin polarization transfer and contrast cumulants for different kinds of helix and domain-wall initial states. Building on such physical states, we unify the scaling behavior of the higher-order cumulants, giving rise to two types of dynamics: anomalous diffusive and superdiffusive. For the former, these higher cumulants show a deviation from Gaussian statistics, with the scaling exponents being identical for the first four orders. For the latter, however, we observe a breakdown of KPZ universality, with the exponents of the third and fourth orders differing significantly from those of the first two. Our results are also agreeable with recent experimental observations, advancing understanding of far-from-equilibrium transport phenomena."

      "summary": "Excitation power and energy dependent photoluminescence (PL) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) studies are carried out on chemical vapour deposition (CVD) grown 1L-MoS2 films to understand the process of trion formation. The study shows that the excitation with sufficiently low photon energy results in the creation of trions directly in the K/K' valleys through photon absorption followed by phonon scattering events. On the other hand, excitation energy sufficiently larger than the band-gap can generate the carriers away from the K/K' valleys. Dissimilarity in the rates of relaxation of the photo-excited electrons and the holes to the bottom of the K/K' valleys results in the transformation of the excitons residing there into trions. Our TAS study clearly demonstrates a temporary increase of the trion population in the K/K' valleys. Moreover, excitation intensity dependent PL spectroscopy performed under above-band-gap excitation, also suggests the coexistence of both the pathways of trion generation in this material. This conclusion is further validated by a rate equation model. Our findings provide valuable insight into the formation of trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), which could be crucial in designing valleytronic devices based on trions."

In this study, we employ a chiral two-body model to simulate bacterial dynamics near the surface. The simulation results show that as bacteria approach the surface, their translational and rotational velocities, as well as their diffusion coefficients, decrease. Under the combination of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and DLVO forces, bacteria reach a stable fixed point in the phase plane and follow circular trajectories at this point. Notably, bacteria with left-handed helical flagella exhibit clockwise circular motion on the surface. During this process, as the stable height increases, the translational velocity parallel to the surface increases while the rotational velocity perpendicular to the surface decreases, collectively increasing the radius of curvature. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that near-field hydrodynamic interactions significantly prolong the surface residence time of bacteria. Additionally, smaller stable heights further amplify this effect, resulting in longer residence times and enhanced surface entrapment."

Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\\pi/4,\\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\\mu\\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM."

The paper discusses the effect of the grain size distribution on the effective scale of current circulation. Log-normal and Weibull distributions are both considered as possible for grain sizes. The effective size for calculating the intragrain current density has been shown to be significantly larger than the average grain size."

Here, we investigate potential causes underlying electric field-induced adhesion hysteresis at the interface between an n-type AFM tip and a p-type silicon sample using atomic force microscopy. Our findings reveal that neither charge trapping nor siloxane bond formation significantly impacts the measured adhesion. Surprisingly, we show that adhesion can be tuned through electric field-induced water adsorption under low relative humidity (RH < 10%). Our results provide new insights into adhesion hysteresis and opportunities for adhesion control."

      "summary": "Fluids under nanoscale confinement differ -- and often dramatically -- from their bulk counterparts. A notorious feature of nanoconfined fluids is their inhomogeneous density profile along the confining dimension, which plays a key role in many fluid structural and transport phenomena in nanopores. Nearly five decades of theoretical efforts on predicting this phenomenon (fluid layering) have shown that its complexity resists purely analytical treatments; as a consequence, nearly all current approaches make extensive use of molecular simulations, and tend not to have generalizable predictive capabilities. In this work, we demonstrate that machine-learning-based models (in particular, a random forest model), trained upon large molecular simulation data sets, can serve as reliable surrogates in lieu of further molecular simulation. We show that this random forest model has excellent interpolative capabilities over a wide range of temperatures and confining lengthscales, and even has modest extrapolative ability. These results provide a promising pathway forward for developing models of nanoconfined fluid properties that are generalizable, lower cost than ``pure\" molecular simulation, and sufficiently predictive for fluids-in-nanopores practitioners.}"

We validate the approach across a complexity ladder: (i) a frustrated 2D Ising model run on a D-Wave Advantage QPU reproduces the known ferromagnet-stripe transition; (ii) finite-temperature checks on 1D Ising recover standard finite-size trends; (iii) a genuinely quantum spin target (XXZ) matches exact diagonalization (ED) on small chains; and (iv) interacting fermions (t-V) in 1D (rings L=2-8) show ED-level energies and the expected kink near V/t ~ 2, with a 2D 2x2 cluster tracking ED slopes up to a uniform offset. A replication-factor study quantifies the accuracy-overhead trade-off, with order-of-magnitude error reduction and diminishing returns beyond r ~ Nq. Except for the classical Ising benchmark and molecular benchmarks, experiments use D-Wave's public DIMOD and Neal simulators; a molecular benzene case in the appendix illustrates portability beyond lattices. The results establish a practical pathway for mapping quantum matter to current annealers, with clear knobs for fidelity, resources, and embedding."

However, critical blind spots in their reliability persist. Here, we address one such significant gap by systematically investigating the accuracy of uMLIPs under extreme pressure conditions from 0 to 150 GPa. Our benchmark reveals that while these models excel at standard pressure, their predictive accuracy deteriorates considerably as pressure increases. This decline in performance originates from fundamental limitations in the training data rather than in algorithmic constraints. In fact, we show that through targeted fine-tuning on high-pressure configurations, the robustness of the models can be easily increased. These findings underscore the importance of identifying and addressing overlooked regimes in the development of the next generation of truly universal interatomic potentials."

We find that a high TMR ratio arises from the resonant tunneling of the down-spin surface states of the hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$, having a $\\Delta_1$-like symmetry around the $\\Gamma$ point. Ni doping tunes the Fermi level and enhances this effect by reducing the overlap between up-spin and down-spin conductance channels in momentum space under the parallel configuration, thereby suppressing antiparallel conductance and increasing the TMR ratio. This mechanism is analogous to Brillouin zone spin filtering and is sensitive to the interfacial distance but not specific to $h$-BN barriers; similar behavior may emerge in MTJs with other two-dimensional insulators or semiconductors. These findings provide insight into surface-state-assisted tunneling mechanisms and offer guidance for the interface engineering of next-generation spintronic devices."

Coupling to electronic domains provides an observable for pinpointing key interactions, e.g. affecting phase transitions. While the equilibrium phase diagram of 1T-TaS2 - characterized by unique transport properties and varying degrees of CDW commensurability - has been studied extensively, an understanding of how the electronic domains in the bulk behave across phase boundaries is lacking. We reveal the three-dimensional evolution of electronic domains in 1T-TaS2 using temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and reciprocal space mapping, complemented by structure factor simulations based on the Hendricks-Teller method. With this methodology, we identify an increasing number of stacking faults near the phase transitions, and a growing fraction of dimerized layers in the commensurate phase upon cooling. We provide structural evidence that the CDW domains mediate the transport properties at phase boundaries, and that they also account for an anomalous intermediate electronic phase within the triclinic regime upon heating. As a paradigmatic material with potential in phase-change memory applications, our study underscores the importance of domain sizes and layer stacking in defining electronic behaviors of van der Waals materials."

However, the definitive feature of Mottness and how it rules the low-energy electronic state remain elusive and experimentally inaccessible in many interesting regimes. Here, we quantitatively describe a filling-controlled Mott state and its interplay with superconductivity by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy in a vdW bulk heterostructure, 4Hb-TaS$_2$, that interleaves strongly correlated 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with superconducting 1H-Ta$_2$ layers. The fine tunability of electron doping induced by interlayer charge transfer allows us to continuously track the spectral function with unsurpassed energy resolution from a depleted narrow band (0.2 electrons per site) toward a Mott transition at half filling. The gradually emerging Mott-Hubbard bands, followed by the sharpening and vanishing of the central quasiparticle peak as predicted in the Brinkman-Rice scenario, unambiguously demonstrate the Mott physics at play. Importantly, the renormalization of the low-energy electrons acts destructively on the superconducting pairing potential, leaving behind nonsuperconducting, paramagnetic puddles at the nanoscale. Our results reveal a seminal system near the border of the Mott criterion that enables us to illustrate the predictive power of the Hubbard model, and set such heterostructures as promising ground for realizing new correlated states in the heavily doped Mott regime."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism, particularly 2D altermagnetism (AM), has attracted considerable interest due to its exceptional physical properties and broad application potential. However, the classification of AM undergoes a fundamental paradigm shift when transitioning from three-dimensional (3D) to 2D symmetry-enforced fully compensated collinear magnetism$-$a shift that has remained largely overlooked. Here, by extending unconventional magnetism to 2D collinear systems, we identify the symmetry conditions and electronic band characteristics of a distinct magnetic phase: type-IV magnetism. This new class lies beyond the established descriptions of ferromagnetism, conventional antiferromagnetism, and AM. Type-IV magnetism supports the successive emergence of both nonrelativistic spin-degenerate and relativistic spin-splitting phenomena, belonging strictly to neither conventional antiferromagnetism nor standard AM. We further establish a universal symmetry classification framework for 2D type-IV magnets via a mapping from the collinear spin layer group to the magnetic layer group. Monolayer MgCr$_2$O$_3$ and monolayer BaMn$_2$Ch$_3$ (Ch=Se, Te) are showcased as representative materials, exhibiting gate-tunable reversible spin textures and the quantum electric Hall effect, respectively. Our work underscores the rich functional prospects of type-IV magnets, offering a new route toward spin manipulation and anomalous transport that promises innovative designs for high-performance spintronic devices."

Here, we explore the development of a sacrificial nanocrystal deposit that can suppress friction and wear. Amorphous \\ce{CaSO4} nancrystals are deposited through salt solution droplet deposition followed by evaporation. During droplet drying, a precursor film of the aqueous \\ce{CaSO4} solution spreads onto a hydrophilic silicon wafer, thus nucleating evenly spread unfaceted amorphous nanocrystals of \\ce{CaSO4} on the wafer surface. We used atomic force microscopy to study the extent, topography, and friction and wear behavior of the deposited nanocrystals. We find that the sacrificial layer of nanocrystals is easy to apply and remove, spreads over large (few cm) areas with a constant thickness of about 8 nm, and has favorable friction and wear behavior."

Here, we report dynamics in suspensions of torque-driven spinning chiral particles that exhibit a distinct and previously unrecognized route to collective dynamics. Using a mean-field kinetic theory, stability analysis, and nonlinear simulations, we demonstrate how flows driven by torque monopoles and self-propulsion resulting from microscopic chirality drive chaotic flows in three dimensions. Unlike the well-known alignment instability of dipolar active matter, the present dynamics is intrinsically tied to self-propulsion and relies on the emergent coupling between nematic and polar order. Our results establish a novel route to pattern formation, suggest strategies for designing torque-driven active suspensions, and provide a mechanistic framework to probe the rheology of chiral fluids."

We find a finite Larmor precession frequency at zero magnetic field, corresponding to the electron spin splitting of $0.8$ $\\mu$eV. This splitting is explained by the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spin fluctuations. Our model analysis shows that the hyperfine interaction for the conduction band electrons is contributed both by the $p$-orbitals of the lead atoms and by the $s$-orbitals of the iodine atoms, with the leading contribution to the hyperfine field fluctuations coming from iodine. This fact agrees well with the 9% iodine contribution to the Bloch amplitude of the conduction band, obtained by DFT calculations. From these findings, the atomic hyperfine constant for the $5s$-orbital of iodine is evaluated as 190 $\\mu$eV."

Motivated by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), atomic quantum interference devices (AQUIDs) have been developed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) confined in toroidal geometries. Here, we propose and numerically investigate an alternative implementation of an AQUID based on a BEC confined in a rotating box potential. A ring-like topology is established by introducing a central depletion region via a repulsive potential barrier. We observe the hallmark AQUID feature -- quantized phase winding that increases in discrete steps with angular velocity. Centrifugal effects induced by rotation degrade phase coherence and impair AQUID performance, which we mitigate by applying a counteracting harmonic confinement. Phase slips are found to be mediated by a vortex propagating from the central depletion zone to the edge of the condensate. To characterize the voltage response, we induce a bias current by translating the box along its long axis while keeping the central barrier fixed. This generates a density imbalance between the two reservoirs, exhibiting a periodic dependence on angular velocity -- analogous to the voltage-flux relation in electronic SQUIDs. Our results demonstrate that rotating box geometries provide a viable and flexible platform for realizing atomtronic AQUIDs with controllable dynamics and well-defined response characteristics."

Incorporation of such intriguing compounds into low-dimensional structures represents an important avenue towards exploiting and enhancing their functionalities. Prominent examples of this group are semiconductors well suited to the band-gap engineering strategies. Here, we present for the first time visible-light-emitting CdSe quantum wells, in which wurtzite MnSe as an alermagnetic candidate plays the role of a barrier. Photoluminescence experiments with temporal resolution demonstrate that in such quantum wells, a built-in electric field is present and strongly influences the energies of the emitted photons, the dynamics of recombination, and excitation power dependence. Numerical simulations allow us to estimate that the magnitude of the electric field is 14MV/m. We anticipate that such quantum wells offer potential to probe the barrier properties and that wurtzite MnSe is an interesting platform to study the interplay of the altermagnetism and built-in electric field."

Replicating such capabilities in synthetic active matter remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic active particles can adapt to hidden hydrodynamic perturbations through physical embodiment alone, without explicit sensing mechanisms. Using reinforcement learning to control self-thermophoretic particles, we show that they learn navigation strategies to counteract unobserved flow fields by exploiting information encoded in their physical dynamics. Remarkably, particles successfully navigate perturbations that are not included in their state inputs, revealing that embodied dynamics can serve as an implicit sensing mechanism. This discovery establishes physical embodiment as a computational resource for information processing in active matter, with implications for autonomous microrobotic systems and bio-inspired computation."

A comprehensive characterization has been performed, including structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements. Our findings indicate that a modest growth pressure of approximately 0.5 GPa is sufficient for the formation of the Sm1111 phase in the ex-situ process. In contrast, the in-situ process requires higher synthesis pressure (4 GPa) and temperature (1400 {\\deg}C for 1 hour) to achieve the Sm1111 phase with enhanced superconducting properties. Notably, the optimized in-situ process significantly reduces the reaction time needed for the formation of the Sm1111 phase compared to conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), leading to an increase in the transition temperature by 3 K and improvements in critical current density (Jc). Conversely, the optimized ex-situ process results in an onset transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 53 K, similar to that of CSP, though it enhances the Jc by an order of magnitude. Despite these advancements, a small amount of impurity phases, as observed during CSP, persists in all Sm1111 samples prepared through either the in-situ or ex-situ CA-HP processes. These results suggest that the in-situ process under optimized conditions (1400 {\\deg}C, 4 GPa for 1 hour) can effectively improve the superconducting properties of Sm1111. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis comparing these results with high gas pressure techniques, spark plasma sintering, and CSP methods suggests that a small amount of impurity phases in Sm1111 is persistent and cannot be completely eliminated by various pressure techniques, even at the applied pressure of up to 4 GPa."

To address this issue, Gallavotti introduced a new model, the Reversible Navier-Stokes Equation (RNS), which recovers the time-reversal symmetry of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations while retaining the core characteristics of the latter. We show that for fluids on Log-Lattices, the GCFT holds for the RNS system. Furthermore, we show that this result can be extended, under certain assumptions, to the traditional, irreversible Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we show that the phase space contraction rate satisfies a large deviation relation which rate function can be estimated."

But how the presence (or real-time insertion) of bolaamphiphiles influences lamellar lipid membranes is poorly understood. Using a combination of time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy, in situ small angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS), and neutron spin echo (NSE) measurements, we monitor here the pH-dependent interactions of nanoscopic vesicles of a representative bolaamphiphilea glucolipid consisting of a single glucose headgroup and a C18:1 (oleyl) fatty acid tail (G-C18:1)with the membranes of an essentially cylindrical, fluid-phase phospholipid (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, DOPC). We find that the two mesophases interact spontaneously at all pH values, producing large-scale morphological remodeling. Under neutral and acidic conditions, when the bolaamphiphile assumes a cylindrical shape, vesicles fuse with one another, producing invaginations, inner tubulation and vesicle-in-vesicle aggregates. Under basic pH, by contrast, when the carboxylic acid is deprotonated and the molecule is inverted-conical in shape, the bolaamphiphile causes phospholipid membranes to undergo poration, budding, and vesiculation. This pH-dependent, environmentally sensitive membrane remodeling without the disruption of the essential bilayer motif illustrates how local, molecular-level packing perturbations can translate into global system-level morphological changes, enabling membranes to acquire environmental sensitivity and real-time adaptability. These results support the notion that molecular fluxeswhich add (or remove) amphiphilic molecules to biological membranescan endow de novo functionalities (e.g., pH sensitivity) and influence global morphologies of cell-sized vesicles."

Here, we directly visualize, in real time, the nanosecond current-driven dynamics of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmion lattice using element-specific pump-probe X-ray microscopy. By tuning spin-orbit torque relative to local pinning potentials, we reveal two regimes: incoherent flow, where mobile skyrmions scatter from pinned ones, inducing recoil dynamics with 3-20 ns relaxation, and coherent flow, where the lattice translates uniformly. Quantification of the reproducible post-pulse relaxation trajectories via an inverse analyis method based on the Thiele equation yields the nanoscale AFM skyrmion-skyrmion scattering potential, which decays exponentially with a range of 30 nm, in full agreement with micromagnetic simulations. At higher current densities, the lattice exhibits coherent motion free from detectable Hall and inertial effects or dynamical deformation, enabling robust GHz operation. These findings establish a quantitative framework for AFM skyrmion interactions and demonstrate deterministic control of their collective dynamics over billions of cycles even in the incoherent flow regime, thereby paving the way for multi-skyrmion spintronic devices."

      "summary": "V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range.Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition."

      "summary": "The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explo- rations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four-dimensional (4D) QHE has been experi- mentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension."

In this study, we investigate the phase transition between GeSe crystalline polymorphs induced by either global annealing at moderate temperatures or localized laser-induced heating. The highly conductive gamma-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline alpha-GeSe while preserving a well-aligned crystal orientation. The distinct structural and electronic properties at the gamma-GeSe/alpha-GeSe interface were investigated by transmission electron microscopy analysis. We propose that the clustering of Ge vacancies in the gamma-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures is a key mechanism driving the transition, leading to the formation of alpha-GeSe through the segregation of a minor GeSe2 phase. Furthermore, we observe a high electrical resistance contrast of approximately 10^7 between gamma-GeSe and alpha-GeSe, underscoring the potential of GeSe as a model polymorphic system for electronic applications, including phase-change memory."

As an alternative, the Van Kampen summation method is used. The force is determined for small and for large distances between the sheets. The results of both models are quite similar. Precisely, at large distances, the attractive force decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At short distances, the force is a finite attractive one. With a small chemical potential, the force can have a minimum at distances of the order of 0.3 nm, then increases, reaches a maximum at distances of the order of 200 nm, and at large distances decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At a chemical potential of significantly more than 1 eV, a minimum is not observed."

      "summary": "Van der Waals heterostructures offer a versatile platform for tailoring electrical, magnetic, optical, and spin transport properties of materials through proximity effects. Notably, hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides have been shown to induce valley-Zeeman spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene, resulting in significant spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientations. However, in-plane lifetimes remain isotropic due to the inherent threefold symmetry of the heterostructure. Here, we demonstrate that pentagonal PdSe$_2$, characterised by unique in-plane anisotropy, induces an unprecedented gate-tunable SOC in graphene. Our measurements reveal a remarkable 10-fold modulation of the spin lifetime for spins oriented within the graphene plane at room temperature. Moreover, the directional dependence of the spin lifetimes, along the three spatial directions, suggests the existence of a persistent in-plane spin texture component that dominates the spin dynamics. These findings deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures and open avenues for designing and engineering novel topological phases in graphene-based heterostructures within the strong SOC regime."

      "summary": "Van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a platform to study and control the physical properties of low-dimensional materials. While strategies developed for two-dimensional (2D) crystals are not directly transferable to one-dimensional (1D) systems, we can benefit from them by creating layers formed by interconnected chains. Here, we develop a molecular strategy to illustrate this concept consisting of assembling 1D materials in 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Crystals of [FeX(pzX)(bpy)] (X = Cl, F; pz = pyrazole; bpy = bipyridine) consist of iron chains along the b-axis, crosslinked via bpy ligands along the a-axis to form 2D layers, stacked along the c-axis via vdW forces. This structural anisotropy manifests itself in highly-anisotropic optical properties, as demonstrated by optical measurements in the visible and terahertz ranges, results which are supported by DFT calculations. Chemical substitution enables the tuning of the optical properties, as exemplified by the photoluminescence of the Cl-derivative, which is quenched for the F-derivative. Thin-layers are obtained by mechanical exfoliation, and their optical properties are further tuned through the fabrication of orthogonally-twisted vdW heterostructures, enabling to effectively switch-off the optical anisotropy. Our work highlights the chemical flexibility of vdW layered MOFs as a platform for designing and manipulating 1D architectures."

The nonlinear optical signals are analyzed using a high-resolution spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 60 $\\mu$eV. We demonstrate the potential of the setup by means of SHG polarization tomography measurements on a Cu$_2$O crystal as well as through a SHG spectral scan of a ZnSe crystal over a wide energy range from 1.4 to 3.1 eV. Polarization-resolved confocal SHG mapping of various twisted mono- and bilayer MoS$_2$ structures is also presented.

This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments."

      "summary": "A new frontier in condensed matter physics is to stack atomically thin layered-materials with different properties and create intriguing phenomena which do not exist in any of the constituent layers. Transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS$_2$, with an alternating stacking of a spin liquid candidate 1T-TaS$_2$ and a superconductor 1H-TaS$_2$, is a natural heterostructure for such a purpose. Recently, rare phenomena are indeed observed, including chiral superconductivity, two-component nematic superconductivity, topological surface superconductivity and enigmatic magnetic memory. A widely proposed starting point to understand such a mysterious heterostructure requires strong electronic correlation, presumably provided by 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with a narrow flat band near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the theoretically expected flat band near $E_F$ in the energy-momentum space for the first time. However, this flat band only exists on the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer with broken translational symmetry, but not on the 1T-TaS$_2$ layers buried in the bulk. These results directly challenge the foundation of the current theoretical paradigm. On the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer, we further reveal a pseudogap and an anomalous doping effect. These phenomena and the dichotomy between surface and bulk layers also shed new light on the unusual coexistence of distinct electronic orders in this mysterious heterostructure."

Rocking curve measurements on polished sections revealed typical FWHM values of about 22 arcsec, which is indicative of relatively high structural quality for a solid-solution crystal. The grown substrate crystals are nearly lattice-matched with Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) to allow epitaxial growth of high-quality thin films. Single crystalline YIG films with thicknesses between 100 nanometer and 2.9 micrometer were successfully grown on epi-polished YSGAG substrates using liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). Selected magnetic and microwave properties of the epitaxial films, which still exhibit small lattice misfits to the substrates, were then studied at room temperature. In addition, initial low-temperature investigations confirm that the YIG/YSGAG system is superior to the conventional YIG/GGG (Gd3Ga5O12) system at temperatures below 10 K, as the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth does not increase with decreasing temperature. Therefore, the novel diamagnetic substrates are better suited for microwave applications at low temperature, as excessive damping losses induced by paramagnetic substrates can be avoided. It therefore seems to be a suitable pathway to achieve scalable microwave components for hybrid-integrated quantum systems based on ultralow-damping YIG films that can operate efficiently at millikelvin temperatures."

However, the thermodynamic metastability of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and oxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing phase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates using gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under an ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further post annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting film exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical factors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of Ln3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control suppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer coverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking faults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a single superconducting transition and high Tc,onset. These findings provide valuable insights for the layer-by-layer epitaxy growth of diverse oxide high-temperature superconducting films."

The field theoretical arguments for this rely on locality. While locality is typically met in standard experimental settings, it need not always apply. Motivated by experimental capabilities of photonic platforms, we study confining potentials that are step-like in angular momentum, and thus non-local in position. We show that this non-local potential does not host conventional chiral edge modes. These are replaced by gapless spin-2 edge states, which we show are connected to the collective 'graviton' excitations that are gapped in the bulk. Furthermore, we show that FQH states host gapless (charged) quasiparticles on their edges, even in the absence of conventional edge modes. The edge state energies vanish as a power-law in system size, with an exponent that characterises the bulk topological order."

Despite a slight underestimation of Ag's melting point, the MTP model achieved consistent accuracy across elemental and binary systems without direct fitting to high-temperature phase transitions. The predicted eutectic temperature and composition were found in close agreement with experimental observations.

However, it has proven challenging to realize experimentally due to the difficulty of isolating this structure from any significant out-of-plane bonding while maintaining structural integrity. Here, single crystals of Zr2CuSb3, a potential candidate for the checkerboard lattice, were synthesized using the solution (self-flux) method, and their structure was confirmed via X-ray diffraction. Electrical transport measurements indicate metallic behavior with electron-dominated carriers. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals multiple electron pockets and significant kz broadening due to its large c-axis and low dispersion features in k z. Density functional theory calculations further disentangle the contributions from each high-symmetry plane, providing a comprehensive characterization of electronic behavior."

      "summary": "Large lossless currents in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their one-dimensional geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non-metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation-mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, we propose an asymmetric stress field strategy using extrusion to directly nucleate a high-density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear-driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron-based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of nearly one angstrom trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current-carrying capacity of IBS at 33 T, along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS, but also offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in rigid crystalline systems."

      "summary": "We study the degree of band flatness and the anisotropic quantum geometry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the parameters of lattice relaxation using optical conductivity. We show that the degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about the bandwidth of the two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of (generalized) optical Hall conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature, which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is slightly different from zero. Lastly, we demonstrate that the vanishing of flat band velocity and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient conditions for the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case. In contrast, the determinant condition can only be saturated in anisotropic systems."

      "summary": "The development of wearable photodetectors demands a unique combination of broadband optical sensitivity, mechanical flexibility, and skin-compatibility, with these requirements rarely met simultaneously by existing technologies. Here, we present photodetectors that combine all of these performances. This is achieved by integrating carbon dots, engineered for extended ultraviolet-to-near-infrared absorption, with single-layer graphene transferred onto a plastic substrate. Unlike traditional quantum dot systems, our carbon dots achieve a broad ultraviolet-to-near-infrared response without toxic heavy metals. Graphene provides an efficient channel for charge transport, while a biocompatible chitosan-glycerol electrolyte enables efficient, low-voltage carrier modulation, with peak performance at approximately 0.5 V gate bias. The resulting photodetectors exhibit a broadband photoresponse with responsivities of approximately 0.19 A/W at 406 nm, 0.32 A/W at 642 nm, and 0.18 A/W at 785 nm. They maintain consistent performance at a bending radius of 0.8 cm with negligible degradation after repeated cycles. Furthermore, skin-compatibility assessments using the SkinEthic model confirm the non-toxic nature and suitability of our devices for direct skin contact. The combination of broadband absorption (400-800 nm), flexibility, and skin-compatibility, along with low-voltage operation ($<$ 1.5 V), positions our photodetectors as promising building blocks for next-generation wearable optoelectronics."

      "summary": "Many-body functionals of the Green's function can provide fundamental advances in electronic-structure calculations, due to their ability to accurately predict both spectral and thermodynamic properties, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and total energies of materials. However, fully first-principles, self-consistent calculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge, ultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and restricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we present a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids using a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical Hubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating frequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to accurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials with $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we employ the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles representation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for frequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution for dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the paradigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral features, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving the description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental measurements."

Contrary to earlier interpretations proposing a transient nonpolar intermediate phase, we demonstrate that the broad transitional regions previously observed in STEM images are projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of 180$^\\circ$ domain walls, which are a characteristic form of inversion domain boundary. This is further confirmed by STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Our simulations reveal that switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, directly explaining the emergence of zigzag-shaped domain walls, and is consistent with the nucleation-limited switching behavior observed in experimental switching dynamic measurements. Furthermore, we show that increasing Sc content systematically lowers domain wall energy and associated nucleation barrier, thereby reducing the switching field in agreement with experimental trends. These findings establish a direct connection between local domain wall structure, switching kinetics, and macroscopic ferroelectric behavior."

      "summary": "We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) investigation of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals two distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at 10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these magnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above TN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations, which agree with the experimentally observed spin excitation"

      "summary": "Thermoelectric metamaterials featuring width modulation through constrictions (constricted geometries) have emerged as a promising approach for improving heat management and thermoelectric performance. Through a combination of theoretical calculations, analytical formalism, and validation against experimental data, it is shown that thermoelectric performance in such geometries is governed by two fundamental mechanisms of pure geometrical origin: (i) a characteristic scaling behavior of resistance with Transmissivity, and (ii) the critical formation of the Constriction Thermal Resistance. Hourglass-shaped thermoelectric legs - identified as optimal in recent experiments - are found to exhibit the same underlying transport mechanisms observed in other constricted profiles, including single and multiple sharp constrictions. The commonly used Geometric Parameter is found to be insufficient for capturing the full influence of geometry on transport, whereas Transmissivity serves as a robust descriptor of constricted geometry, independent of material choice or device operating conditions. A universal scaling formalism is derived linking electrical and thermal resistances, along with key thermoelectric performance metrics, to the Transmissivity. A unified optimization framework is also developed for composite legs, incorporating both constricted material and contact electrodes. This framework indicates that previously reported performance gains may be largely attributed to contact resistance, rather than geometry alone. Transmissivity is established as a key geometric descriptor, enabling generalized design principles and global optimization criteria for enhancing thermoelectric power generation. This analysis elucidates new avenues in the design of thermoelectric metamaterials for efficient energy conversion."

We demonstrate that triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) offers a unique opportunity to increase fabrication speeds and scalability of micro- and nanoscale 3D structures. Due to its nonlinearity and low power requirements, TTA-UC enables localized polymerization with nanoscale resolutions while simultaneously printing millions of voxels per second through optical parallelization using off-the-shelf light-emitting diodes and digital micromirror devices. Our system design and component integration empower fabrication with a minimum lateral feature size down to 230 nm and speeds up to 112 million voxels per second at a power of 7.0 nW per voxel. This combination of high resolution and fast print speed demonstrates that TTA-UC is a significant advancement in nanofabrication technique, evidenced by the fabrication of hydrophobic nanostructures on a square-centimeter scale, paving the way for industrial nanomanufacturing."

      "summary": "We study the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting, relativistic gas of charged scalar bosons in a uniform magnetic field, including both statistical and vacuum contributions at arbitrary field strengths. Focusing on the low-temperature regime and separating the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) from excited states provides a clearer view of the magnetic field's impact on thermodynamic quantities. We revisit Bose Einstein condensation (BEC), specific heat, magnetization, and the equation of state (EoS). A central result is the diffuse character of BEC induced by the magnetic field, reflected in the specific heat, which exhibits two plateaus: the first appears when the system becomes effectively one-dimensional through magnetic confinement, while the second-associated with the true one-particle ground state-is suppressed by the field. Consequently, no critical condensation temperature arises. For magnetization, the LLL contribution shifts from diamagnetic to paramagnetic As the field strengthen with the inclusion of the excited states, the statistical magnetization remains negative. In contrast, the vacuum contribution dominates at strong fields, driving paramagnetic. We also show that antiparticles enhance specific heat, magnetization, and total pressure. These effects are illustrated for a pion gas under neutron star conditions and compared with previous results for a neutral vector boson system."

      "summary": "A multispecies diffuse interface model is formulated in a fluctuating hydrodynamics framework for the purpose of simulating surfactant interfaces at the nanoscale. The model generalizes previous work to ternary mixtures, employing a Cahn-Hilliard free energy density combined with incompressible, isothermal fluctuating hydrodynamics where dissipative fluxes include both deterministic and stochastic terms. The intermolecular parameters in the free energy are chosen such that one species acts as a partially miscible surfactant. From Laplace pressure measurements we show that in this model the surface tension decreases linearly with surfactant concentration, leading to Marangoni convection for interfaces with concentration gradients. In the capillary wave spectrum for interfaces with and without surfactant we find that for the former the spectrum deviates significantly from classical capillary wave theory, presumably due to Gibbs elasticity. In non-equilibrium simulations of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, deterministic simulations showed that the surfactant delays pinching of a fluid cylinder into droplets. However, stochastic simulations indicate that thermal fluctuations disrupt the surfactant's stabilizing effect. Similarly, the spreading of a patch of surfactant, driven by Marangoni convection, was found to be partially suppressed by thermal fluctuations."

Compared to existing architectures, in a unitary network each local tensor is required to be a unitary matrix upon suitable reshaping. Global unitarity is ensured when the network obeys a suitable ordering property. Unitary operators represented by unitary networks need not preserve locality. In particular, we show that the class of unitary networks encompasses global unitaries which preserve locality up to exponentially suppressed tails, as in those that naturally arise from the finite-time evolution of local Hamiltonians. Non-invertible symmetries, as exemplified by the non-local Kramers-Wannier duality in one dimension, can also be represented using unitary networks. We also show that information flow in a unitary network can be characterized by a flow index, which matches the known index for quantum cellular automata as a special case."

      "summary": "We investigate the impact of rigid rotation on the spontaneous breaking of U(1) symmetry in a Bose gas, which is described by a self-interacting complex scalar field Lagrangian. Rigid rotation is introduced through a specific metric that explicitly depends on the angular velocity $\\Omega$. We begin by determining the free propagator for this model at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. Using this propagator, we calculate the thermodynamic potential in terms of an energy dispersion relation $\\epsilon_{k}$. It is found that in both the U(1) symmetric phase and the symmetry-broken phase, two energy branches emerge. In the symmetry-broken phase, they are identified with a massive phonon and a massless roton mode. Notably, rotation does not alter $\\epsilon_{k}$ at low momentum. Setting $\\mu=0$, we use the total thermodynamic potential, which includes classical, thermal, vacuum, and nonperturbative ring contributions, to explore how the condensate depends on $T$ and $\\Omega$. We first focus on the classical and thermal parts of the thermodynamic potential and find that the critical temperature of the U(1) phase transition scales as $\\Omega^{1/3}$. By identifying the (pseudo-)Goldstone and non-Goldstone modes of this model with $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ mesons, we calculate the $T$ and $\\Omega$ dependence of masses $m_{\\pi}$ and $m_{\\sigma}$. We demonstrate that the Goldstone theorem holds only when the one-loop (thermal) corrections to $m_{\\sigma}$ and $m_{\\pi}$ are taken into account. We further explore the $T$ and $\\Omega$ dependence of the condensate, determine the $\\sigma$ dissociation temperatures for fixed $\\Omega$, and compare them with the critical temperature of the phase transition. Additionally, we emphasize the role played by the nonperturbative ring potential, especially in altering the order of the phase transition with and without rotation."

Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry."

      "summary": "This thesis explores thermal correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs) and their connection to black hole geometry within the AdS/CFT correspondence, using a near-boundary expansion as the main tool. Two themes are examined. First, we show that the stress-tensor sector of boundary correlators encodes information about black hole singularities. By resumming contributions from the stress-tensor and its composites, we uncover branch-point singularities in complex time, corresponding to bulk geodesics that cross the horizon, reflect off the singularity, and return to the boundary. We further clarify the role of double-trace operators in restoring analyticity and the KMS condition, and establish a map between bulk geodesics and OPE sectors of the thermal correlator. Second, we study thermal stress-tensor correlators in CFTs with pure gravity duals. Through holographic calculations in Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we identify a robust universal behaviour - near the lightcone the correlators are described by three universal functions. The bulk Lagrangian only affects the arguments of these functions through corrections to the cubic stress-tensor couplings and the thermal stress-tensor one-point function. We relate this behaviour to causality constraints such as the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), showing that ANEC saturation makes the correlator temperature-independent. Overall, our results demonstrate that thermal correlators - especially their stress-tensor sector - serve as sensitive probes of black hole interiors, causality, and universality in holographic CFTs."

Our results demonstrate a pronounced enhancement of photon number density at the low-energy tail, indicative of a BEC-like phase transition. This phenomenon is further corroborated by an analysis of the entropy evolution during the cooling process, revealing that the condensate configuration corresponds to the entropy maximum, in accordance with thermodynamic principles. These findings establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for photon BEC formation in cold electron environments and underscore the significance of entropy maximization as a driving mechanism for condensation."

The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated alloys, enabling informed alloy selection."

Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models can also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials and molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop PET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic Diversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on samples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be further manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation of the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations probing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the accuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS and the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems: lithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy (HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific datasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement for all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be performed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are comparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models."

Our method models the bath as a finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections, interpreted either as a physical realization or as a conceptual representation, rather than as a continuum. This explicit modeling enables direct control over non-Markovian dynamics and allows spectral diagnostics via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of system observables. Using a triangle-based bath motif and its extension to a six-qubit anisotropic fractal-like architecture, we demonstrate how spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth. Standard machine learning tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and gradient boosting can then be employed to infer bath parameters and estimate proximity to exceptional points (EPs). The results suggest that spectral analysis can serve as a unifying, quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory, simulation, and experiment, offering both a student-accessible and experimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory flow in quantum hardware. Rather than treating noise as an adversary to be eliminated, our approach views structured baths as collaborative partners, enabling controlled memory and delocalized memory and information flow for engineered quantum dynamics. In addition to its diagnostic power, the framework offers a modular and reproducible platform for teaching open quantum systems. Ultimately, we frame this as a pedagogical tool: students can pair FFT-based spectral features with lightweight ML (e.g., PCA and gradient boosting) to extract data-rich, interpretable signatures of open-system and non-Hermitian dynamics."

While prior studies have linked the QMPE to Liouvillian exceptional points--non-Hermitian features emerged at the Liouvillian level, it remains largely elusive whether the QMPE can occur in intrinsic non-Hermitian systems, where non-Hermiticity is inherent at the Hamiltonian level. Here, we unequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable parity-time-symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Surprisingly, we find that exceptional points are neither sufficient nor necessary for the QMPE in this context, contrasting previous findings. Specifically, we show that the QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian and Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when Hermitian Hamiltonian is restored. Owing to the complete suppression of the slowest relaxation mode facilitated by parity-time symmetry, we attribute the observed QMPE to a cooperative effect of remaining relaxation modes. We obtain analytical expressions that delineate the parameter regimes supporting the QMPE. Our findings not only broaden the scope of the QMPE but also reveal its intricate interplay with non-Hermitian features beyond exceptional points."

Previous theoretical works have employed the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game as a toy model, demonstrating that population mobility is crucial in determining the species' coexistence. One key prediction is that biodiversity is jeopardized and eventually lost when mobility exceeds a certain value--a conclusion at odds with empirical observations of highly mobile species coexisting in nature. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework and study a spatial RPS model, where individual mobility is adaptively regulated via a Q-learning algorithm rather than held fixed. Our results show that all three species can coexist stably, with extinction probabilities remaining low across a broad range of baseline migration rates. Mechanistic analysis reveals that individuals develop two behavioral tendencies: survival priority (escaping from predators) and predation priority (remaining near prey). While species coexistence emerges from the balance of the two tendencies, their imbalance jeopardizes biodiversity. Notably, there is a symmetry-breaking of action preference in a particular state that is responsible for the divergent species densities. Furthermore, when Q-learning species interact with fixed-mobility counterparts, those with adaptive mobility exhibit a significant evolutionary advantage.

      "summary": "We provide a general machine learning methodology that integrates classical shadow representations with unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) to explore various quantum phase transitions. By sampling spin configurations from random Pauli measurements, our approach can effectively analyze hidden statistical patterns in the data, thereby capturing the distinct signatures of quantum criticality through their fluctuations. We benchmark this approach across various spin-1/2 systems, including the 1D XZX cluster-Ising model, the 1D bond-alternating XXZ model, the 2D transverse-field Ising model, and the 2D Kitaev honeycomb model. We show that PCA not only reliably detects and distinguishes both symmetry-breaking and topological transitions, but also enables their qualitative classification based on characteristic fluctuation patterns. Our data-driven approach does not require any knowledge of the Hamiltonian or explicit order parameters, and can therefore be a general and applicable tool for probing new quantum phases."

      "summary": "We determined the metal/silicate partition coefficients of hydrogen and carbon, DH and DC, simultaneously under typical conditions of Earth's core formation. Experiments demonstrate that both DH and DC diminish in the presence of carbon and hydrogen, respectively, indicating their strong interactions in liquid metal. With these partitioning data, we investigated the core and bulk Earth abundances of hydrogen and carbon based on core formation scenarios that are compatible with the bulk silicate Earth composition and the mass fraction and density deficit of the core. The results of the single-stage core formation modelling are markedly different from those using DH and DC individually determined in earlier experiments, indicating that the Earth building blocks do not match enstatite chondrites in water abundance and require contributions by carbonaceous chondrites. The multi-stage core formation models combined with an Earth accretion scenario accounting for isotopic composition show 0.18-0.49 wt% H and 0.19-1.37 wt% C in the core, leading to 0.53-1.40 wt% H2O (present as H in the core) and 0.07-0.44 wt% C in the bulk Earth. Our modelling also demonstrates that up to 53% and 72% of Earth's water (hydrogen) and carbon, respectively, could have been derived from non-carbonaceous chondritic materials."

      "summary": "Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use, provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph modification."

In the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decohered state resides on the self-dual critical line of the quantum Ashkin-Teller (qAT) model, as a result of the specific choice of the decoherence channel. On the other hand, since the mixed state under $X+ZZ$ decoherence satisfies the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in a weak sense, the Ising criticality of the pure state can be partially preserved in the mixed system. By making use of the combination of the doubled Hilbert space formalism and matrix product states, we carry out extensive numerical study to elucidate the mixed state criticality. We find that under decoherence up to moderate strength, the mixed states on the critical line have properties of the Ising CFT, where $c=1/2$, $\\eta=0.25$ and, $\\nu=1$. These values of the central charge and critical exponents contrast with the ones in the $c=1$ orbifold boson CFT describing the critical state of the qAT model. In addition, we also observe the threshold of the mixed Ising CFT. The strong decoherence washes out the remnant Ising criticality and induces strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking."

Photons have traditionally played this role in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but achieving the same goal using solid-state bosons remains challenging. Here we demonstrate strong and tunable spin-magnon coupling between molecular spin qubits and magnons in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator. Using [Gd(W$_5$O$_{18}$)$_{2}$]$^{9-}$ as the spin ensemble and CrSBr as the magnonic resonator, we observe anticrossings and coherent hybridization, realizing magnon quantum electrodynamics for the first time. Crucially, by rotating the magnetic field, we can dynamically change the magnon symmetry from linear to chiral, enabling in-situ tuning of the coupling strength. Our results establish magnonic cavities as a platform for scalable chiral quantum optics with magnetic materials."

      "summary": "Resolving how defects emerge and interact within the hierarchical structure of polycrystalline materials remains a core challenge in materials science. Grain-mapping methods such as three-dimensional X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) provide essential mesoscale context but lack the resolution to image lattice defects. Conversely, high-resolution methods like Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) capture lattice distortions but not the surrounding microstructure. Here, we introduce a transferable framework that unifies these complementary approaches into a single, non-destructive workflow. Enabled by open-source software, the method translates grain orientation and position data into precise goniometer settings for DFXM imaging without dismounting or reorienting the sample. Applied to an iron polycrystal containing 1100 grains, DFXM motor positions were calculated for all grains within seconds, enabling on-the-fly targeting of specific grains. This allows reproducible zooming from the millimetre-scale aggregate to individual dislocations. We resolve three-dimensional misorientation fields across grain boundaries with 36 nm pixel size, directly capturing grain-grain interactions within their microstructural context. Finally, we show transferability from LabDCT to synchrotron and XFEL platforms, enabling new ways of studying defect interactions across scales."

      "summary": "Understanding how biomechanical reorganization governs key biological processes, such as morphogenesis and development, requires predictive insights into stress distributions and cellular behavior. While traditional approaches focused on cell motion as a response to stress, we demonstrate that Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) -- robust attractors and repellers in cellular flows -- precede and drive long-term intercellular stress reorganization, physically governed by the mechanical properties of intercellular junctions. We show that this hidden flow skeleton correlates strongly with biomechanical metrics, bridging microscopic cell motion with mesoscopic biomechanics. Specifically, attractors and repellers mark hotspots of compressive and tensile stress enrichment (exceeding tenfold), alongside heterogeneities in cell packing. Notably, these connections remain robust across varying strengths of cell-cell and cell-substrate force transmission. Finally, by linking the attracting regions in the flow skeleton to future cell extrusion spots, we establish a direct link between cell motion and biologically significant outcomes. Together, these findings establish a framework for using cell motion to independently infer biomechanical metrics and bridge the scale mismatch between cell motion and biomechanics, potentially offering a new route to interpret mechanosensitive biological processes directly from cell trajectories."

While entanglement is hindered by thermalization when the system and environment exchange a conserved quantity, we demonstrate that breaking this conservation law through the system-environment interaction drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state. Such an interaction will generate multiple competing equilibration channels, effectively mimicking baths at distinct chemical potentials. When the environment also supports long-range correlations, these channels mediate nonlocal dissipation capable of generating entanglement. We illustrate the scheme in a model of two color centers weakly coupled to a spin-pumped magnet, where tuneable magnon excitations enable steady-state entanglement over finite distances. Our results outline a scalable approach to dissipative entanglement generation, rooted in the conservation structure and environmental correlations rather than fine-tuned coherent control or active driving."

Analogous to zero-field cooling and field cooling in conventional magnetic materials, an annealing protocol is devised to control the energy in an isolated system. Depending on the strength of disorder, the susceptibilities at zero field bifurcate at a specific energy, which signals the presence of different magnetic regimes. This behavior is apparent both in a numerical simulation by exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve particles, as well as in an experiment with thousands of Rydberg atoms representing dipolar interacting quantum spins. The annealing protocols open a new path to explore the energy-dependent phase structure of spin systems at low energies. Our observation of a nonthermal metastable regime might indicate the existence of a phase transition to a novel state of isolated quantum spin systems."

Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. More than 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than 150000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. Thus, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as >90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article."

Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk graphite.These results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management."

Our analysis reveals a key contrast: while charge $\\Delta_T$ noise remains strictly positive, spin $\\Delta_T$ noise undergoes a sign reversal from positive to negative, driven by the interplay between spin-flip scattering as well as Andreev reflection. In contrast, charge quantum shot noise remains positive and sign-definite, which is valid for spin quantum shot noise also. The emergence of negative spin $\\Delta_T$ noise has two major implications. First, it establishes a clear distinction between spin resolved $\\Delta_T$ noise and quantum shot noise: the former is dominated by opposite-spin correlations, whereas the latter is led by same-spin correlations. Second, it provides access to scattering mechanisms that are not captured by quantum shot noise alone. Thus, negative spin $\\Delta_T$ noise serves as a unique probe of the cooperative effects of Andreev reflection and spin flipping. We further place our results in context by comparing them with earlier reports of negative $\\Delta_T$ noise in strongly correlated systems, such as fractional quantum Hall states, and in multiterminal hybrid superconducting junctions. Overall, this work offers new insights into the mechanisms governing sign reversals in $\\Delta_T$ noise and highlights their role as distinctive fingerprints of spin-dependent scattering in superconducting hybrid devices."

So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and antisolitons in opposite directions. Here we introduce a local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally coupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations - so-called non-Hermitian skin waves, which are typically unstable - into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We harness such non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information. Finally, we illustrate this mechanism in another class of metamaterials that displays the breaking of 'supersymmetry' causing only antisolitons to be driven. Our observations and models demonstrate a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons, whereby solitons create their own driving force by locally straining the material. Beyond the scope of our study, non-reciprocal solitons might provide an efficient driving mechanism for robotic locomotion and could emerge in other settings, e.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter."

      "summary": "There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is \"trans-Planckian\", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior."

      "summary": "The field of active matter explores the behaviors of self propelled agents out of equilibrium, with active suspensions, such as swimming bacteria in solutions, serving as impactful models. These systems exhibit spatio-temporal patterns akin to active turbulence, driven by internal energy injection. While bacterial turbulence in dense suspensions is well studied, the dynamics in growing bacterial suspensions are less understood. This work presents a phenomenological coarse-grained model for growing bacterial suspensions, incorporating hydrodynamic equations for bacterial density, orientation, and fluid velocity, with birth and death terms for colony growth. Starting with low density and random orientations, the model shows the development of local ordering as bacterial density increases. As density continues to rise, the model captures four distinct phases; dilute, clustered, turbulent, and trapped based on structural patterns and dynamics, with the turbulent phase characterized by spatio-temporal vortex structures, aligning with observations in dense bacterial suspensions."

Recent work has shown that such patterns arise generically from forces that violate Newton's third law, known as nonreciprocal interactions. These nonequilibrium phenomena are challenging for modern theories. Here, we introduce a model mixture of active (self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles amenable to exact mathematical analysis. We exploit state-of-the-art methods to derive exact hydrodynamic equations for the particle densities, which reveal effective nonreciprocal couplings between the active and passive species. We study the resulting collective behavior, including the linear stability of homogeneous states and phase coexistence in large systems. This reveals a novel phase diagram with the spinodal associated with active phase separation protruding through the associated binodal, heralding the emergence of dynamical steady states. We analyze these states in the thermodynamic limit of large system size, showing, for example, that sharp interfaces may travel at finite velocities, but traveling phase-separated states are forbidden. The model's mathematical tractability enables precise new conclusions beyond those available by numerical simulation of particle models or field theories."

      "summary": "Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems."

      "summary": "An emergent numerical approach to solve quantum impurity problems is to encode the impurity path integral as a matrix product state. For time-dependent problems, the cost of this approach generally scales with the evolution time. Here we consider a common non-equilibrium scenario where an impurity, initially in equilibrium with a thermal bath, is driven out of equilibrium by a sudden quench of the impurity Hamiltonian. Despite that there is no time-translational invariance in the problem, we show that we could still make full use of the infinite matrix product state technique, resulting in a method whose cost is essentially independent of the evolution time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in the integrable case against exact diagonalization, and against existing calculations on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour in the general case. Our method could be a very competitive method for studying long-time non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and be potentially used as an efficient impurity solver in the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory."

      "summary": "The bosonic Kitaev chain is known to have extraordinary properties distinct from its fermionic counterpart. For example, it exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect -- its eigenmodes are exponentially localized to the edges of the chain -- even when the system is Hermitian. Such non-Hermitian effects originate from the fact that the dynamics of bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians is governed by a non-Hermitian matrix. In the topological phase of the model, the modes conspire to lead to phase-dependent and directional exponential amplification of a classical drive. In this work, we study the robustness of this topological amplification to on-site dissipations. We examine the effect of uniform and non-uniform losses under various configurations. We find a remarkable resilience to dissipation in some configurations, while in others the dissipation causes a topological phase transition which eliminates the exponential amplification. In particular, when the dissipation is placed on every other site, the system remains topological and the exponential amplification persists even for very large loss rates which exceed the system's non-Hermitian gap. On the other hand, we find that dividing the chain into unit cells of an odd number of sites and placing dissipation on the first site leads to a topological phase transition at a certain critical value of the dissipation. Our work thus provides insights into the robustness against losses of the topological amplification of non-Hermitian systems and sets explicit limits on the bosonic Kitaev chain's ability to act as a multimode quantum sensor in realistic lossy scenarios."

In this work, we present a theoretical framework for spin transport in 2D-to-2D tunneling systems, driven by spin pumping. This theory applies to a vertical heterostructure where two layers of metallic 2D electron systems are separated by an insulating barrier, with one layer exchange-coupled to a magnetic layer driven at resonance. Utilizing a non-perturbative Floquet-Keldysh formalism, we derive general expressions for the tunneling spin and charge currents across a broad range of driving frequencies, extending beyond the traditional adiabatic pumping regime. At low frequencies, we obtain analytical results that recover the known behaviors in the adiabatic regime. However, at higher frequencies, our numerical findings reveal significant deviations in the dependence of spin and charge currents on both frequency and precession angle. This work offers fresh insights into the role of magnetization dynamics in tunneling transport, opening up new avenues for exploring non-adiabatic spin pumping phenomena."

One often finds that the prediction of deep learning methods trained on many ensembles below and above the critical temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ behaves similarly to an order parameter, and this analogy has been successfully used to locate $T_{\\rm c}$ and estimate universal critical exponents. In this work, we pay particular attention to the ability of a convolutional neural network to capture these critical parameters for the 2-$d$ Ising model when the network is trained on configurations at $T=0$ and $T=\\infty$ only. We directly compare its output to the same network trained at multiple temperatures below and above $T_{\\rm c}$ to gain understanding of how this extreme restriction of training data can impact a neural network's ability to classify phases. We find that the network trained on two temperatures is still able to identify $T_{\\rm c}$ and $\\nu$, while the extraction of $\\gamma$ becomes more challenging."

From this study, we find an easy-hard-easy transition in the model hardness as the problem instances become more diluted, and associate this behaviour to the clusterization and connectivity of the underlying Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs. We calculate the efficiency of obtaining minimum energy configurations and find that population annealing outperforms simulated annealing for the cases close to this hardness peak while reaching similar efficiencies in the easy limits.

We compare this adaptive method to a linear schedule and find that the adaptive method achieves improved efficiencies while being robust against final temperature miscalibrations."

Here we examine the effects of grain angularity on the indicators of self-organisation, using simulations of bi-disperse regular $N$-polygons and varying $N$ systematically. We find that: the strong correlation between local cell stresses and orientations, as well as the collapses of the conditional distributions of scaled cell stress ratios to a master Weibull form for all cell orders $k$, are independent of angularity and friction coefficient. In contrast, increasing angularity makes the collapses of the conditional distributions sensitive to changes in the friction coefficient."

We show that non-orientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that orientable ribbons can also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by how the unit normal vector winds around the centerline of the ribbon, and provides conditions for constructing soft modes of deformation compatible with the topology of multiply-twisted connected ribbons."

Brenner, J. Colloid Interface Sci., 71(2): 189-208, 1979). In this work, we extend the theory to a non-centrosymmetric, axisymmetric particle whose centers of mass and buoyancy are offset from its hydrodynamic center, so that the gravitational torque acts in addition to the net gravitational force. We study the Taylor dispersion of such particles as a function of non-dimensional parameter $\\alpha$ representing the strength of the gravitational torque: $\\alpha$ is zero when the centers of mass and buoyancy are at the hydrodynamic center and increases when they are offset from it. Analytical calculations show that for small $\\alpha$, the Taylor dispersion is always amplified: the effective diffusivities created by sedimentation always increase as $\\alpha^2$, but they start to decrease at certain values of $\\alpha$ and approach to zero for large values of $\\alpha$. We further analyze the transient regime of the mean-square displacement (MSD). At short times, the MSD grows quadratically with time before crossing over to the diffusive regime. The ballistic regime persists to relatively high sedimentation P\\'eclet numbers (the ratio of the rotational relaxation time to the sedimentation time), even in the presence of a gravitational torque, indicating that such a torque does not considerably alter sustained ballistic motion."

Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We interpret our observations in the framework of molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles - a distinct state of interfacial ionic matter - our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport, electrified matter and wetting dynamics at interfaces."

The resulting equations assume that the system's phonon follow classical time-local dynamics with delta-correlated noise. We apply our method to the study of the charging/discharging of a periodically driven quantum dot, and a three-level model for a single-electron pump, analyzing the signatures in the transient current, electron population and process performance of the phonon dynamics. For these systems, we adopt the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and consider external harmonic driving of the phonon at frequencies comparable with the electron modulation, and different scenarios, varying electron-phonon coupling strength, coupling to the electron part of the system, and in phase and anti-phase driving.

The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics."

For example, it can be used for the removal of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting devices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film with a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field applied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single flux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the behavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average velocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is the presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when the line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer multiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are rather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$ dominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The onset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the frequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low frequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the amplitude. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of vortex lines driven by oscillating magnetic field in patterned superconducting films, offering potential pathways for controlling the magnetic flux in superconducting devices."

      "summary": "MXenes, a family of 2D transition metal compounds, have emerged as promising materials due to their unique electronic properties and tunable surface chemistry. However, the translation of these nanoscale properties into macroscopic devices is constrained by suitable cross-linking strategies that enable both processability and controlled inter-flake charge transport. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was first used to stabilize MXenes in chloroform, followed by diamine-mediated cross-linking to tune precisely the interlayer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD/GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine-crosslinked Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. The dominating charge transport mechanism is variable range hopping (VRH) in accordance with the structure analysis of the films. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing in MXene composites, observing pronounced water sensitivity and selectivity, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Insights into molecular cross-linking and its impact on charge transport open avenues for next-generation MXene-based electronic devices."

The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures."

We investigate the machine learnability of additive atomic contributions to electronic DOS, focusing on atom-projected DOS rather than structural DOS. This approach for structure-property mapping is both scalable and transferable, and achieves high prediction accuracy for pure and compound silicon and carbon structures of various sizes and configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of this model to complex Sn-S-Se compound structures. Utilizing locally trained DOS is shown to significantly enhance the accuracy of predicting material properties, including band energy, Fermi energy, heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility. Our findings indicate that directly learning atomic DOS, rather than structural DOS, improves the efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability of machine learning in structure-property mapping.

      "summary": "We study the Josephson effect in one-dimensional SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnetic layers (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the potential barrier at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface can induce a quantized resonant tunneling effect. This effect not only modifies the amplitude of the critical current but also affects the phase of the Josephson current. As the exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, the critical current displays periodic resonance peaks. These peaks occur under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)} d_{1(2)} = \\left(n_{1(2)} + 1/2\\right) \\pi$, where $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\\hbar v_F)$ is the center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, with $v_F$ being the Fermi velocity, and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \\cdots$. It can be inferred that the potential barrier suppresses the transport of spin-singlet pairs while allowing spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis to pass through. As these spin-triplet pairs traverse the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers, the total phase they acquire determines the ground state of the Josephson junction. At the resonance peaks, the Josephson current primarily arises from the first harmonic in both the parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations. However, in perpendicular configurations, the second harmonic becomes more significant. In scenarios where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while allowing it to persist in the $\\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved."

      "summary": "Hypothesis Roughening transitions at solid-liquid interfaces govern crystal morphology in diverse systems. In ice crystallization, these transitions control interfacial faceting and surface kinetics. Faceted morphologies are often associated with ice-active molecules, which inhibit recrystallization and are essential for cryopreservation. We hypothesize that kinetic roughening transitions can induce faceting even in the absence of ice-active agents, particularly at high solute concentrations with depressed melting points, potentially complicating the interpretation of crystal morphology as an indicator of ice activity. Experiments We investigated the kinetic roughening transition of ice in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and proline-water solutions using cryomicroscopy and real-time image analysis. Crystals grew in microdroplets, maintaining near-equilibrium conditions as solute concentration increased during growth due to conversion of liquid water to ice. Antifreeze protein type III (AFPIII) was applied to distinguish intrinsic roughening from adsorption-mediated effects. Findings A distinct kinetic roughening transition temperature (TR = -16.0 +/- 0.2 oC) was identified, marking a shift from rounded disks at higher temperatures to faceted hexagonal plates at lower temperatures, independent of solute type. Recrystallization below TR revealed asymmetry between growth and melting interfaces. AFPIII promoted faceting even above TR, consistent with stabilization of step edges and elevation of the roughening transition temperature. These results clarify the interplay between intrinsic interface kinetics and molecular adsorption, with implications for interpreting ice morphology, surface roughening, and cryopreservation design."

      "summary": "Polarization switches are of great technological interest because of their many applications in long distance electromagnetic communication (e.g., polarization division multiplexing). Binary bits can be encoded in the two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave that they transmit. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically > 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension, ~5 nm thickness) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an \"artificial multiferroic magnonic crystal (AMMC)\" is reported. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites confined spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, which then radiate electromagnetic waves in space via magnon-photon coupling. In some particular direction(s), determined by the AMMC parameters, the polarization of the beam at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by switching the direction of SAW propagation in the piezoelectric substrate between two mutually orthogonal directions via activation of two different pairs of SAW launching electrodes. By aligning the transmitter and the receiver along such a direction (known only to authorized users), one can communicate covertly from point to point, without the need for encryption or cryptography."

This method is similar to filled state scanning tunneling microscopy but uses a stationary contact instead of a mobile tip to analyze the two-dimensional electron system. Applying magnetic fields up to 15 T, we identified clear peaks in the differential current-voltage profiles, indicative of Landau level formation. By examining deviations from the expected Landau fan diagram, we extract an absolute value for the exchange-induced energy shift. Through an empirical analysis, we derive a formula describing the exchange shift as a function of both magnetic field strength and electron filling. Our findings indicate that the emptying of the $\\nu=2$ and $\\nu=3$ Landau levels causes an exchange interaction energy shift in the $\\nu=1$ level. Unlike prior studies that infer level energies relative to one another and report oscillatory g-factor behavior, our method references the energy of the Landau levels above the filled states of the contact under a bias voltage, revealing that only the ground state Landau level experiences a measurable exchange shift."

Using a two-step physical vapor deposition (PVD) process, we synthesize the eight ternary chalcohalide compounds, demonstrating bandgaps ranging from 1.38 to 2.08 eV with sharp, single-component photoluminescence (PL) peaks. In a parallel exploration of carrier dynamics and intrinsic electron-phonon interactions -- comprehensively studied using power-, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL measurements -- we map their direct impact on optoelectronic performance. Supported by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) defect calculations, we establish clear structure-property relations, identifying solid-solutions engineering as an effective means to fine-tune the native phonon structures and further suppress non-radiative recombination. This study provides a blueprint for optimizing chalcohalides as high-efficiency materials across a wide range of optoelectronic applications."

In this work, we report the observation of the topological Hall effect in both compensated and non-compensated synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmion systems based on [Pt/Co/Ru]2 bilayers. The antiferromagnetic skyrmions are demonstrated to be robust in these synthetic antiferromagnets under zero-field. Our first principal calculations and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the formation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmions are due to nonuniformity of RKKY coupling associated with the proximity effect induced magnetic moments in the Pt and Ru layers. The skyrmions in the Pt and Ru layers adjacent to the Co layers lead to the observed topological Hall effect. This work not only provides insight into the effect of the magnetic proximity effect and RKKY coupling to the SAF skyrmions, but also an effective detection method for the SAF skyrmion systems, thereby laying a foundation for the practical application of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in spintronic devices."

In addition, clamping to the substrate interface plays an important role. We studied epitaxial (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ thin films grown on NdScO$_3$ to see if time-resolved measurements can shed more light on the complex interaction. In particular, we compare standard measurements of the pyroelectric coefficient by temperature-dependent hysteresis loops to transient deformation measurements on picosecond timescales in the same material. The advantage of the time-resolved approach lies in its increased sensitivity in thin films compared to that of polarization hysteresis measurements. Whereas a fast thermal expansion of the ferroelectric thin film was observed after femtosecond laser excitation of the intermediate SrRuO$_3$ layer, heat diffusion simulations reveal frustration of the thermal expansion, which might be explained with the charge dynamics at the Schottky barrier formed at the SrRuO$_3$/(Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. More studies are required to quantitatively assess the individual contributions to the pyroelectric coefficient of the materials used in our layer architecture."

      "summary": "Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility."

      "summary": "The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration."

      "summary": "Critical phenomena on scale-free networks with a degree distribution $p_k \\sim k^{-\\lambda}$ exhibit rich finite-size effects due to its structural heterogeneity. We systematically study the finite-size scaling of percolation and identify two distinct crossover routes to mean-field behavior: one controlled by the degree exponent $\\lambda$, the other by the degree cutoff $K \\sim V^{\\kappa}$, where $V$ is the system size and $\\kappa \\in [0,1]$ is the cutoff exponent. Increasing $\\lambda$ or decreasing $\\kappa$ suppresses heterogeneity and drives the system toward mean-field behavior, with logarithmic corrections near the marginal case. These findings provide a unified picture of the crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous criticality. In the crossover regime, we observe rich finite-size phenomena, including the transition from vanishing to divergent susceptibility, distinct exponents for the shift and fluctuation of pseudocritical points, and a numerical clarification of previous theoretical predictions."

Edge modes of this matrix with vanishing real part are exactly dissipation-free. We show that this matrix is always adiabatically deformable, through a symmetry-preserving path, to a topologically trivial Hermitian matrix. Hence no symmetry-protected, dissipation-free edge modes exist in quadratic open fermions.

We show that these systems naturally realize the generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary discrete gauge groups. A one-body dynamics emulates that of a particle carrying a superposition of charges, each coupled to distinct static gauge-field configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup $C \\subset G$, while the Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the embedding of $C$ in $G$. The role of other subgroups in shaping both the lattice geometry and the dynamics is analyze in depth assuming $C$ finite. We discuss a theorem of direct engineering relevance that, for any cyclic gauge group, yields all compatible translation groups. We then construct two-dimensional examples of Cayley-crystals equivalent to square lattices threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Importantly, Cayley-crystals can be realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms."

      "summary": "The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins, driven by short-range non-polar interactions, can find the biologically correct assembly as the energy minimizing state. Short-ranged potentials produce rugged energy landscapes however, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional, local minimizers. Successful self-assembly simulations depend both on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space. We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales. Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes."

While foundational, empirical demonstrations have thus far been confined to specific cases, either assuming time-reversal symmetry or involving particular measurement types, leaving the verification of their universal validity unrealized. This work leverages a quantum computer to report the first empirical verification of a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, valid for arbitrary dynamics and observables. We theoretically derive the relation, revealing survival activity as the pivotal thermodynamic quantity governing the precision bound. The verification is demonstrated on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor, which is treated as a real thermodynamic system. To achieve accurate results despite substantial device errors, we introduce a generic protocol for measuring survival activity and employ circuit reduction techniques based on the relation's properties. This strategy allows us to empirically identify survival activity for the first time and confirm the derived relation. Furthermore, the quantum computer's versatility enables the implementation of optimal observables, leading to the saturation of the relation and demonstrating the sharpness of our bound on a physical device. The method's broad applicability is further illustrated by verifying the trade-off for quantum time correlators. Our findings establish quantum computers as effective platforms for investigating fundamental thermodynamic trade-off relations."

The design of quantum sensors can be optimized by maximizing the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which characterizes the precision of parameter estimation for an ideal measurement. Here we consider the response of a quantum system as a means to estimate the strength of a weak external perturbation. General expressions for the QFI in the nonequilibrium steady-state are derived, which hold for arbitrary interacting many-body systems at finite or zero temperature, and can be related to susceptibilities or linear-response transport coefficients. For quantum dot nanoelectronics devices, we show that electron interactions can lead to *exponential* scaling of the QFI with system size, highlighting that quantum resources can be utilized in the full Fock space. The precision estimation of voltages and fields can also be achieved by practical measurements. In particular, we show that current-based metrology in quantum circuits can leverage many-body effects for enhanced sensing."

We apply BF-DCQO to a HUBO problem featuring three-local terms in the Ising spin-glass model, validated experimentally using 156 qubits on an IBM quantum processor. In the studied instances, our results outperform standard methods such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, quantum annealing, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of a similar HUBO problem on a 433-qubit Osprey-like quantum processor.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities."

The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Fractons, characterized by restricted mobility and governed by higher-moment conservation laws, represent a novel phase of matter with deep connections to tensor gauge theories and emergent gravity. This work systematically explores the duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles-Carroll and Galilean-within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical actions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of motion and demonstrate a new set of dualities between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles in gauge fields. The algebraic underpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses, revealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean algebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a framework for coupling fracton gauge fields and background geometry, linking them to non-Lorentzian spacetimes and deriving the corresponding constraint on geometry. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity and exotic condensed matter systems."

The planar and non-local Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is so coupled to a complex scalar field sector in 1+2 dimensions, where we achieve the Lee-Wick pseudo-scalar electrodynamics. The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field, of the Lee-Wick mass, and also of the coupling constants of this model. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-Wick mass."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability."

Our proof is based on identifying the KMP process with a stochastic flow of kernels describing transition probabilities in a certain model of random walk in space-time random environment. This allows to apply a recent result of arXiv:2401.06073 proving convergence of the density field of random walks in random environment to the KPZ equation in a suitably general sense."

It quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the purification rate are also obtained."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies."

Here we explore this phenomenon, using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study angular momentum generation in several driven chiral molecular models. We demonstrate that significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such systems."
