As such, the motion of an exciton cannot be described by the same Landau quantization that characterizes the motion of a free electron or hole in magnetic field. This contrast raises the question: How can a bound exciton state in magnetic field be expressed through the Landau quantization of its electron and hole components? Here, the authors establish a scattering selection rule between the Landau levels { n e , n h } of the electron and hole components, and identify an elegant pairing law between these Landau levels, n e = n h + l . The pairing law provides information on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number l , and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. [Phys.
