      "summary": "We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed."

      "summary": "Low-energy emergent and emanant symmetries can be anomalous, higher-group, or non-invertible. Such symmetries are systematically captured by topological orders in one higher dimension, known as symmetry topological orders (symTOs). Consequently, identifying the emergent or emanant symmetry of a system is not simply a matter of determining its group structure, but rather of computing the corresponding symTO. In this work, we develop a method to compute the symTO of 1+1D systems by analyzing their low-energy spectra under closed boundary conditions with all possible symmetry twists. Applying this approach, we show that the gapless antiferromagnetic (AF) spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model possesses an exact emanant symTO corresponding to the $D_8$ quantum double, when restricted to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2^x \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^z$ subgroup of the $SO(3)$ spin-rotation symmetry and lattice translations. Moreover, the AF phase exhibits an emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, whose exact components are described jointly by the symTO and the $SO(3)$ spin-rotations. Using condensable algebras in symTO, we further identify several neighboring phases accessible by modifying interactions among low-energy excitations: (1) a gapped dimer phase, connected to the AF phase via an $SO(4)$ rotation, (2) a commensurate collinear ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with a $\\omega \\sim k^2$ mode, (3) an incommensurate, translation-symmetric ferromagnetic phase featuring both $\\omega \\sim k^2$ and $\\omega \\sim k$ modes, connected to the previous phase by an $SO(4)$ rotation, and (4) an incommensurate ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with both $\\omega \\sim k^2$ and $\\omega \\sim k$ modes."

      "summary": "Kinetic constraints are generally expected to slow down dynamics in many-body systems, obstructing or even completely suppressing transport of conserved charges. Here, we show how gauge theories can defy this wisdom by yielding constrained models with faster-than-diffusive dynamics. We first show how, upon integrating out the gauge fields, one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theories are exactly mapped onto XX models with non-local constraints. This new class of kinetically constrained models interpolates between free theories and highly constrained local fermionic models. We find that energy transport is superdiffusive over a broad parameter regime. Even more drastically, spin transport exhibits ballistic behavior, albeit with anomalous finite-volume properties as a consequence of gauge invariance. Our findings are relevant to current efforts in quantum simulations of gauge-theory dynamics and anomalous hydrodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems."

      "summary": "This article presents a novel, robust and efficient framework for fatigue crack-propagation that combines the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) with phase-field fracture (PFF). Contrary to cycle-by-cycle PFF approaches, this work relies on a single simulation and uses standard crack propagation models such as Paris' law for the material response, simplifying its parametrization. The core of the methodology is the numerical evaluation of the derivative of a specimen's compliance with respect to the crack area. To retrieve this compliance the framework relies on a PFF-FEM simulation, controlled imposing a monotonic crack growth. This control of the loading process is done by a new crack-control scheme which allows to robustly trace the complete equilibrium path of a crack, capturing complex instabilities. The specimen's compliance obtained from the PFF simulation enables the integration of Paris' law to predict fatigue life. The proposed methodology is first validated through a series of benchmarks with analytical solutions to demonstrate its accuracy. The framework is then applied to more complex geometries where the crack path is unknown, showing a very good agreement with experimental results of both crack paths and fatigue life."

      "summary": "In 1975 Edwards and Anderson introduced a new paradigm that interacting quenched systems, such as a spin-glass, have a phase transition in which long time memory of spatial patterns is realized without spatial correlations. We show here that the information about the time-dependent correlations above the spin-glass transition are embedded in the four spin correlations of the intensity of speckle pattern. This encodes the spin-orientation memory and can be measured by the technique of resonant magnetic x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (RM- XPCS). We have implemented this method to observe and accurately characterize the critical slowing down of the spin orientation fluctuations in the classic metallic spin glass alloy $Cu_{1-x}{Mn}_x$ over time scales of ${2}$ sec. to $2 \\times 10^{\\mathbf{4}}$ secs. Remarkably the divergence of the correlation time as a function of temperature is consistent with the Vogel-Vulcher law, universally used to characterize the viscous relaxation time in structural glasses. Our method also opens the way for studying phase transitions in systems such as spin ices, quantum spin liquids, the structural glass transition, as well as possibly provide new perspectives on the multifarious problems in which spin-glass concepts have found applications."

This persistent difficulty underscores the interplay of various complex factors. Recently, the role of evaporation has attracted attention for its dual impact: it can either enhance stability or accelerate bursting. To depict a comprehensive overview on soapy objects, we propose first a short description on the evaporation of drops to present some key results on the evaporation-induced cooling and the consequences on the internal flows generated by Marangoni effects. Then, we review the literature on foam films and foams, examining three distinct systems: pure liquids, non-volatile, and volatile surface active molecules. We show that evaporation of foam films and foams can lead to significant variations of temperature. In conclusion, we identify a series of open questions and suggest potential research pathways to address these challenges."

Here, we investigate hydrogels composed of hydrophobic colloidal soot particles -- carbon black (CB) -- and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a food-grade polymer functionalized with hydrophobic groups binding physically to CB. As described in [Legrand et al., Macromolecules 56, 2298-2308 (2023)], CB-CMC hydrogels exist in two flavors: either electrically conductive when featuring a percolated network of CB particles decorated by CMC, or insulating where isolated CB particles act as physical cross-linkers within the CMC matrix. We compare these two types of CB-CMC hydrogels under Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS), combining rheometry with Time-Resolved Ultra-Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (TRUSAXS) and electrical conductivity measurements. Both types of hydrogels exhibit a \"type III\" yielding scenario, characterized by an overshoot in G'' and a monotonic decrease in G', although the underlying microscopic mechanisms differ markedly. Conductive CB-CMC hydrogels display a yield strain (6%) concomitant with a drop in DC conductivity, indicative of the macroscopic rupture of the percolated CB network at length scales larger than a few microns, beyond USAXS resolution. At larger strain amplitudes, the conductivity of the fluidized sample increases again, exceeding its initial value, consistent with shear-induced formation of a transient, dynamically percolated network of CB clusters. In contrast, insulating CB-CMC hydrogels exhibit a larger yield strain (60%), beyond which the sample flows and the average distance between CB particles decreases. This reorganization is concomitant with a more than tenfold increase in conductivity, although it remains below that of conductive hydrogels at rest."

In this study, by combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the trilayer nickelate superconductor $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ at ambient pressure. We reveal a dichotomy in the electronic band renormalizations of $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ in comparison to cuprate superconductors. At a high energy scale of hundreds of meV, its band structure is strongly renormalized by electron correlation effect enhanced by Hund coupling. The resultant waterfall-like dispersions resemble the high-energy kinks in cuprate superconductors. However, at low energy scales of tens of meV, the dispersive bands are nearly featureless and devoid of any resolvable electron-boson interactions, in drastic contrast to the low-energy kinks observed in cuprates and other correlated 3d transition-metal compounds. The dichotomic band renormalizations highlight the disparity between nickelate and cuprate superconductors and emphasize the importance of strong electron-correlation in the superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates."

Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of tMoTe$_2$, revealing pronounced twist-angle-dependent band reconstruction shaped by orbital character, interlayer coupling, and moir\\'e potential modulation. Density functional theory (DFT) captures the qualitative evolution, yet underestimates key energy scales across twist angles, highlighting the importance of electronic correlations. Notably, the hole effective mass at the K point exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on twist angle, peaking near 2{\\deg}, consistent with band flattening at the magic angle predicted by continuum models. Via electrostatic gating and surface dosing, we further visualize the evolution of electronic structure versus doping, enabling direct observation of the conduction band minimum and confirm tMoTe$_2$ as a direct band gap semiconductor. These results establish a spectroscopic foundation for modeling and engineering emergent quantum phases in this moir\\'e platform."

      "summary": "Despite the rapid rise in perovskite solar cell efficiency, poor reproducibility remains a major barrier to commercialization. Film crystallization and device performance are highly sensitive to environmental factors during fabrication, yet their complex interactions are not well understood. In this work, we present a systematic framework to investigate the influence of both individual and coupled environmental variables on device efficiency and crystallization kinetics. We developed an integrated fabrication platform with precise, independent control over ambient solvent partial pressure, absolute humidity, and temperature during spin-coating and thermal-annealing processes, respectively. Using the platform, we implemented a closed-loop Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently explore the multi-dimensional processing space. We mapped the impact of these environmental variables on device performance and identified coupled effects among them. In-situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements further validated these findings by revealing a nonlinear interaction between absolute humidity and solvent partial pressure during spin-coating, which affects crystallization dynamics. To isolate and quantify these interactions, we developed an interpretable machine learning approach that combines knowledge distillation with Shapley interaction analysis. The model revealed the contribution of each interaction varies across different processing conditions. Our study highlights the importance of integrated ambient sensing and control to achieve repeatable perovskite solar cells, and demonstrates the utility of combining active learning with interpretable machine learning to navigate complex, high-dimensional processing landscapes."

This gives a natural thermodynamic distance to equipartition that bounds statistical distinguishability and grows monotonically under doubly stochastic relaxation. The construction extends to arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states with a chosen reference distribution, where the Kullback Leibler divergence splits into an entropy deficit and a reference weight coupling, acts as a Lyapunov functional when the reference is fixed, and reduces to excess free energy in canonical settings. We connect these static notions to dynamics by decomposing entropy production into adiabatic (housekeeping) and nonadiabatic parts, identify the latter with the rate of decay of the divergence to the reference, and complement this with trajectory and activity-based potentials that yield fluctuation symmetries, thermodynamic uncertainty bounds, and activity-limited speed constraints on steady currents"

Although prior models of noise-assisted diffusion have been largely confined to idealized one dimensional settings, we present a physically realistic two-dimensional theoretical framework that integrates anisotropic quartic confinement with localized thermal cold spots to direct impurity dynamics. Using a generalized Fokker Planck formalism, we show that the geometry of the thermal landscape, particularly the width and arrangement of cold spots, governs a noise induced transition between monostable and bistable effective potentials. This enables tunable noise activated hopping and supports conditions favorable for stochastic resonance (SR) if weak periodic driving is applied. Quantitative predictions are made for how impurity localization and effective barrier heights depend on the cold spot width and trap depth , offering experimentally testable signatures. We propose an experimental realization using optothermal techniques, such as dual beam optical tweezers and laser cooling, which can sculpt reconfigurable thermal profiles with sub micron resolution. This model establishes a versatile pathway for programmable impurity manipulation and noise sensitive control in semiconductor structures, bridging theoretical predictions with feasible experimental detection via photoluminescence mapping or lock in signal amplification."

      "summary": "The pursuit of emergent quantum phenomena lies at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics. A recent breakthrough in this arena is the discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) in twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tbMoTe2), marking a paradigm shift and establishing a versatile platform for exploring the intricate interplay among topology, magnetism, and electron correlations. While significant progress has been made through both optical and electrical transport measurements, direct experimental insights into the electronic structure - crucial for understanding and modeling this system - have remained elusive. Here, using spatially and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({\\mu}-ARPES), we directly map the electronic band structure of tbMoTe2. We identify the valence band maximum, whose partial filling underlies the FQAHE, at the K points, situated approximately 150 meV above the {\\Gamma} valley. By fine-tuning the doping level via in-situ alkali metal deposition, we also resolve the conduction band minimum at the K point, providing direct evidence that tbMoTe2 exhibits a direct band gap - distinct from all previously known moire bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide systems. These results offer critical insights for theoretical modeling and advance our understanding of fractionalized excitations and correlated topological phases in this emergent quantum material."

Unlike the SU(2) case, we observe a chiral-reversed quantum phase transition, where each competing phase is adiabatically connected to one of the chiral Haldane phases predicted in the SU(3) AFH chain with local adjoint representation. In the vicinity of the Heisenberg point, we identify a symmetry-protected topological state that appears at the first excited energy level. We also study the spontaneous $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry breaking of the system, and provide a variational wavefunction that captures the transition from the topological phase to the trivial phase. Finally, we propose an experimental realization of our bosonic model by two spin-1/2 bosons in an optical lattice."

Taking into account the magnon dynamics via the magnetic flux, we present an effective circuit model of gain-driven MPs, which allows to manipulate the coupling strength of MPs by tuning the size of a ferromagnet and incorporates the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons due to the shape magnetic anisotropy. In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr nonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon coupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent magnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also effectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies, resulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one to widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic field. These findings indicate that there is a trade-off relation between the coupling strength of MPs and the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons. This work is attributed to understanding of the interplay between gain-loss and USC in nonlinear polariton dynamics, offering a novel principle for frequency tunable maser-like devices based on gain-driven MPs."

      "summary": "The pursuit of high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators faces fundamental challenges, including narrow topological gaps and low Curie temperatures ($T_{\\text{C}}$) in existing materials. Here, we propose a transformative strategy using bilateral hydrogenation to engineer a robust QAH state in the topologically trivial ferromagnetic semiconductor Cr$_{\\text{2}}$Ge$_{\\text{2}}$Te$_{\\text{6}}$. First-principles calculations reveal that hydrogenation induces a topological phase transition in Cr$_{\\text{2}}$Ge$_{\\text{2}}$Te$_{\\text{6}}$ by shifting its Dirac points-originally embedded in the conduction bands-to the vicinity of the Fermi level in Cr$_{\\text{2}}$Ge$_{\\text{2}}$Te$_{\\text{6}}$H$_{\\text{6}}$. This electronic restructuring, coupled with spin-orbit coupling, opens a global topological gap of 118.1 meV, establishing a robust QAH state with Chern number $C=$ 3. Concurrently, hydrogenation enhances ferromagnetic superexchange via the $d_{z^{2}}$-$p_{z}$-$d_{xz}$ channel, significantly strengthening the nearest-neighbor coupling $J_{\\text{1}}$ by 3.06 times and switching $J_{\\text{2}}$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. Monte Carlo simulations predict a high $T_{\\text{C}}$ = 198 K, sustained well above liquid nitrogen temperature and far exceeding pristine Cr$_{\\text{2}}$Ge$_{\\text{2}}$Te$_{\\text{6}}$ (28 K). This work establishes surface hydrogenation as a powerful route to simultaneously control topology and magnetism in 2D materials, unlocking high-temperature QAH platforms for dissipationless spintronic applications."

We show that even without dipolar interactions, the dipolar components can form a spin liquid driven by the octupolar spin liquid. The physics manifests itself experimentally as shadow pinch points: low-intensity pinch points underlying the strong Bragg peaks.

Ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) provide an ideal architecture to harness this coupling. Here, we demonstrate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance in In2Se3 FeS-FETs. Combining high-resolution electron microscopy with electrical transport measurements, we attribute the NDR to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance alpha-2H phase to a high-resistance state. Atomic scale ex-situ imaging reveals that in-plane electric fields (Vd) drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments that generate Moire patterns, and intralayer shear-together producing stress induced phase transitions. Out-of-plane field however results in robust non-volatile polarization switching. These mechanistic insights highlight both the promise of two dimensional ferroelectric devices for multifunctional nanoelectronics and alternative computing paradigms, and the intrinsic limitations of In2Se3 field-effect transistors for conventional ferroelectric memory applications."

Here, a successful synthesis of monolayer (ML) 1T-CrTe2 is reported on a bilayer graphene (BLG) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, that the ferromagnetic transition is observed at the Curie temperature (TC) of 150 K in ML 1T-CrTe2 on BLG, accompanied by unconventional temperature-dependent band evolutions. The spectroscopic analysis and first-principle calculations reveal that the ferromagnetism may arise from Goodenough-Kanamori super-exchange and double-exchange interactions, enhanced by the lattice distortion and the electron doping from the BLG substrate. These findings provide pivotal insight into the fundamental understanding of mechanisms governing 2D ferromagnetism and offer a pathway for engineering higher TC in 2D materials for future spintronic devices."

We begin with the two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) model for a binary-fluid system of active rotors that has two important ingredients: a scalar order parameter field phi that distinguishes regions with clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) spinners; and an incompressible velocity field u. In addition to the conventional CHNS coupling between phi and u, this model has a torque-induced activity term, with coefficient tau, whose consequences we explore. We demonstrate that, if we increase the activity tau, it overcomes dissipation and this system displays a hitherto unanticipated emergent triangular crystal, with spinning vortex triplets at its vertices. We show that this is a nonequilibrium counterpart of an equilibrium plastic crystal. We characterise the statistical properties of this novel crystal and suggest possible experimental realisations of this new state of active matter."

      "summary": "We study $s$-wave superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory for discrete hyperbolic lattices and the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the continuous hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic lattices maintain a finite fraction of boundary sites regardless of system size, thus fundamentally altering superconductivity through enhanced boundary effects absent in flat space. Within the BCS framework for hyperbolic lattices, uniform systems reproduce standard bulk behavior, whereas finite systems with open boundaries, studied through exact diagonalization and Cayley-tree approximations, exhibit boundary-enhanced superconductivity and boundary-only superconducting states that persist above the bulk critical temperature. Numerical studies further reveal that boundary termination critically determines superconducting properties; in particular, rough boundaries with dangling bonds generate zero-energy modes that raise critical temperatures by several times relative to smooth boundaries. Turning to the complementary Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the hyperbolic plane, we find that finite geometries permit radial variations of the condensate absent in infinite space. Owing to the interplay between coherence length and curvature radius, the theory exhibits two types of superconductivity even without magnetic fields, with vortices replaced by lines of vanishing order parameter in the nontrivial type. Our findings establish hyperbolic geometry as a platform for engineering boundary-controlled superconductivity, opening new directions for physics in curved spaces in condensed matter and holography."

      "summary": "Soliton-based computing architectures have recently emerged as a promising avenue to overcome fundamental limitations of conventional information technologies, the von Neumann bottleneck. In this context, magnetic skyrmions have been widely considered for in-situ processing devices due to their mobility and enhanced lifetime in materials with broken inversion symmetry. However, modern applications in non-volatile reservoir or neuromorphic computing raise the additional demand for non-linear inter-soliton interactions. Here we report that solitons in easy-plane magnets, such as bimerons and antibimerons, show greater versatility and potential for non-linear interactions than skyrmions and antiskyrmions, making them superior candidates for this class of applications. Using first-principles and transition state theory, we predict the coexistence of degenerate bimerons and antibimerons at zero field in a van der Waals heterostructure Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ -- an experimentally feasible system. We demonstrate that, owing to their distinct structural symmetry, bimerons exhibit fundamentally different behavior from skyrmions and cannot be regarded as their in-plane counterparts, as is often assumed. This distinction leads to unique properties of bimerons and antibimerons, which arise from the unbroken rotational symmetry in easy-plane magnets. These range from anisotropic soliton-soliton interactions to strong entropic effects on their lifetime, driven by the non-local nature of thermal excitations. Our findings reveal a broader richness of solitons in easy-plane magnets and underline their unique potential for spintronic devices."

      "summary": "The velocity jump found in the crack propagation for rubbers has been a powerful tool for developing tough rubber materials. Although it is suggested by a theory that the jump could be observed widely for viscoelastic materials, the report on a clear jump is very limited and, even in such a case, reproducibility is low, except for elastomers. Here, we use a mundane food-wrapping film as a sample and observe the crack propagation velocity with pulling the sample at a constant speed in the direction perpendicular to the crack. As a result, we find the jump occurs at a critical strain with high reproducibility. Remarkably, the plot of the crack-propagation velocity as a function of strain can be collapsed onto a master curve by an appropriate rescaling, where the master curve is found to be universal for change in the pulling speed and in the sample height. The result reveals a key parameter for the jump is the strain, suggesting the existence of a small length that governs the deformation along the crack. The present study sets limitations on future theories and opens an avenue for the velocity jump to become a tool for developing a wide variety of tough polymer-based materials."

      "summary": "The electrical response of a material when illuminated with light is a key to many optoelectronic device applications. This so-called photoresponse typically has a non-uniform spatial distribution through the active device area, and the ability to spatially resolve the photoresponse enables an in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) is a method that allows the spatial mapping of the photoresponse by raster scanning a focused laser beam over the sample. SPCM is becoming more popular due to its simplicity and power in unraveling fundamental optoelectronic processes. In this review, first, we provide the fundamentals of SPCM to lay the basics for the subsequent discussions. Then, we focus on the literature that employs SPCM to identify the photoresponse of one- and two-dimensional materials. We discuss SPCM measurement results of common materials in detail and introduce a systematic approach to interpreting the SPCM measurements. We have given particular emphasis on the photothermal mechanisms that are excited by the focused laser beam and critically reviewed studies in the literature from the perspective of laser-induced heating of the electronic and the lattice degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of SPCM in determining the mechanisms leading to the photoresponse."

      "summary": "Recent experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moir\\'e semiconductors can be used to realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir\\'e valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states in this moir\\'e semiconductor. Based on a Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's moir\\'e valence band structure, focusing on both, the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$ in the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole filling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moir\\'e honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave."

By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled framework for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models."

For the real application, developments of the thin-film topological superconductors are highly desirable. Bi/Ni bilayer is a possible candidate for thin-film chiral superconductors where the time-reversal symmetry is broken. Here we report the phase shift of resistance oscillations by half flux quantum in a ring-shaped device of epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer induced by a small magnetic field through the ring. The half quantum fluxoid can be a decisive evidence for unconventional superconductors where the superconducting order parameter has an internal degree of freedom. The present result provides a functional operating principle for quantum devices where the phase of the supercurrent can be shifted by \\pi with a small magnetic field, based on the internal degree of freedom possessed by topological superconductivity."

Finding the global minimum is challenging, and heuristic methods are not always guaranteed to succeed. Here, we apply a recently developed automated workflow to systematically explore the energy landscape of 194 magnetic monolayers obtained from the Materials Cloud 2D crystals database and determine their ground-state magnetic order. Our approach enables effective control and sampling of orbital occupation matrices, allowing rapid identification of local minima. We find a diverse set of self-consistent collinear metastable states, further enriched by Hubbard-corrected energy functionals, when the $U$ parameters have been computed from first principles using linear-response theory. We categorise the monolayers by their magnetic ordering and highlight promising candidates. Our results include 109 ferromagnetic, 83 antiferromagnetic, and 2 altermagnetic monolayers, along with 12 novel ferromagnetic half-metals with potential for spintronics technologies."

      "summary": "In general, metal layers cannot be grown epitaxially on Si due to the tendency of metals to react and form a silicide. Even in case the metal layer has a matching lattice symmetry and atomic distance, the Si/metal interface is disturbed by the silicide thus preventing epitaxial growth. One exception is NiAl which is known to grow epitaxially when deposited on Si(001). During the growth, NiAl reacts with Si to form NiSi$_2$. In this work, epitaxial NiAl is grown and significant silicidation is observed in accordance with previous reports. However, the role that this silicide plays as a template for the epitaxial growth of NiAl has not been clear to this date. We hypothesize that NiSi$_2$ acts as a necessary seed layer between the Si substrate and the NiAl layer. Additionally, NiSi$_2$ can be used as a seed layer for the epitaxial growth of other metals besides NiAl. This was tested by growing NiSi$_2$ seperately and replacing the NiAl layer with Cr. Growing Cr directly on Si(001) produced a polycrystalline layer. When NiSi$_2$ was used as a seed layer, the Cr layer was found to be a single crystal with Si(001)//Cr(001) and Si(100)//Cr(100). NiSi was also tried as seed layer for Cr and was found to produce a polycrystalline Cr layer. Using NiSi$_2$ as a seed layer could enable the growth of various epitaxial materials for industrial semiconductor applications."

This study combines first-principles calculations with data-driven techniques from artificial intelligence, specifically principal component analysis (PCA), to reveal trends and correlations across multiple structural, magnetic, and electronic descriptors. For each composition, a set of inequivalent atomic configurations was fully optimized. Structurally, the relaxed lattices exhibit anisotropic expansion, with a pronounced elongation of the out-of-plane lattice parameter ($c$) relative to the in-plane lattice vectors, which promotes the development of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our results reveal that an out-of-plane easy axis emerges at intermediate Ru concentrations (25-28%), while low and high Ru levels favor an in-plane orientation or even vanishing anisotropy. The half-metallic character is also modulated by Ru content, appearing selectively at both ends of the composition range. Additionally, the ferrimagnetic coupling between Mn(4a) and Mn(4c) sublattices leads to nearly compensated magnetic moments below 50% Ru content, with a net moment close to zero around 30%. These findings open a pathway toward the design of tunable spintronic materials with co-optimized perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and half-metallicity, making Mn$_2$RuGa a promising candidate for magnetic tunnel junctions, magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) devices, and high-density magnetic storage applications."

Moving away from half-filling gives rise to re-entrant features in both quantities at fillings associated with Fibonacci numbers. On the other hand, in spin-imbalanced systems, both spin and charge current shows multiple peaks and re-entrant behavior, tunable via hopping dimerization and filling. Including the on-site Hubbard interaction preserves the re-entrant behavior in current and moreover favors finite transport which is absent in the non-interacting ring. These results reveal rich interplay among Fibonacci modulated potential, electron fillings, hopping dimerization and interaction."

We apply Floquet theory to develop an analytical expression for the RF spectrum. Complemented with perturbative and non-perturbative techniques, this allows us to fully understand the underlying acousto-optical double dressing physics of the hybrid quantum system, explaining the observed spectral features. We use these insights to perform an experimental feasibility study of existing emitter-based acousto-optical platforms and come to the conclusion that bulk acoustic waves interfaced with quantum dots render a promising infrastructure to perform acousto-optical Floquet engineering."

Our results highlight the remarkable anisotropic mechanical behavior of these materials, distinguishing them from isotropic structures, such as diamond. Notably, the 8-tetra-22 structure has a higher Young's modulus ($Y_M$) along the $z$-direction compared to diamond. Unlike diamonds, the mechanical properties of Tubulanes are direction-dependent, with significant variations in Young's Modulus (2.3 times). Additionally, the Poisson's ratio is highly anisotropic, with at least one direction exhibiting an approximately zero value. The inherent anisotropy of these materials enables tunable mechanical properties that depend on the direction of applied stress. Regarding their electronic properties, all Tubulane structures studied possess indirect electronic band gaps, dominated by $2p$ orbitals. The band dispersion is relatively high, with band gaps ranging from 0.46 eV to 2.74 eV, all of which are smaller than that of diamond. Notably, the 16-tetra-22 structure exhibits the smallest bandgap (0.46 eV), making it particularly interesting for electronic applications. Additionally, these structures exhibit porosity, which provides an advantage over denser materials, such as diamond. Considering the recent advances in the synthesis of 3D carbon-based materials, the synthesis of tubulane-like structures is within our present-day technological capabilities."

      "summary": "We solve exactly the non-equilibrium dynamics of two discrete random walkers moving in channels with transition rates $p \\neq q$ that swap positions at a rate $s$. We compute exactly the joint probability distribution $P_{n,m}(t)$ for the walkers, revealing the existence of two dynamical crossovers. The first signals the passage from independent diffusion to a swap-dominated regime where the particles act as identical random walkers swapping positions. The second crossover occurs when both channels become indistinguishable and the walkers move around the same position. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a persistent spatial anisotropy defined by the difference between the second moments of the probability distributions in the two channels. Our results may provide a quantitative framework to understand diverse systems. In biology, it is motivated by motor proteins (kinesin/dynein) exchanging cargo leadership, membrane receptors swapping binding partners, or brain synapses with activity-dependent plasticity. In finance, it models traders with distinct risk profiles swapping positions in limit-order books, or volatility spillover between coupled markets. These diverse systems share a unifying theme: exchange processes mediate macroscopic correlations despite individual heterogeneity."

Moszkowski for deformed atomic nuclei, to finding eigenfrequencies of Raman-active spheroidal modes of a spheroid from these of a sphere and compare the outcomes with the results of numerical calculations for CdSe and silver nanoparticles. The modes are characterized by the total angular momentum $j=2$ and are five-fold degenerate for a sphere but split into three distinct modes, characterized by the absolute value of the total angular momentum projection onto the spheroidal axis, in case of a spheroid. The perturbation method works well in case of the rigid boundary conditions, with the displacement field set to zero at the boundary, and accurately predicts the splittings when the spheroidal shape is close to a sphere, but fails in case of the stress-free boundary conditions."

We pose and investigate the inverse problem of reconstructing a Hamiltonian from a spatial map of the local density of states (LDOS) near a fixed energy. We demonstrate high-quality recovery of Hamiltonians from the LDOS using supervised learning. In particular, we generate synthetic data from single-particle Hamiltonians in 1D and 2D, train convolutional neural networks, and obtain models that solve the inverse problem with remarkably high accuracy. Moreover, we are able to generalize beyond the training distribution and develop models with strong robustness to noise. Finally, we comment on possible experimental applications to scanning tunneling microscopy, where we propose that maps of the electronic local density of states might be used to reveal a sample's unknown underlying energy landscape."

      "summary": "The search for intrinsic excitonic insulators (EI) has long been confounded by coexisting electron-phonon coupling in bulk materials. Although the ground state of an EI may be difficult to differentiate from density-wave orders or other structural instabilities, excited states offer distinctive signatures. One way to provide clarity is to directly inspect the phonon spectral function for long wavelength broadening due to phonon interaction with the high velocity EI phason. Here, we report that the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) EI candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ shows extremely anisotropic phonon broadening and softening in the semimetallic normal state. In contrast, such a behavior is completely absent in the broken symmetry state of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ and in the isostructural Ta$_2$NiS$_5$, where the latter has a fully gapped normal state. By contrasting the expected phonon lifetimes in the BCS and BEC limits of a putative EI, our results suggest that the phase transition in Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ family is closely related to strong interband electron-phonon coupling. We experimentally determine the dimensionless coupling $\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}\\sim10$, showing Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ as a rare \"ultra-strong coupling\" material."

In this work we show that the linearity of the magnetoconductance is robust with to interface disorder. The slope of the magnetoconductance changes at a characteristic field strength $B_\\mathrm{arc}$ -- the field strength for which the time taken to traverse the Fermi arc due to the Lorentz force is equal to the mean inter-arc scattering time. For fields much larger than $B_\\mathrm{arc}$, the magnetoconductance is unaffected by disorder.

      "summary": "Mixed states can exhibit two distinct kinds of symmetries, either on the level of the individual states (strong symmetry), or only on the level of the ensemble (weak symmetry). Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to weak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric density matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric random quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site representation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be regarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to more general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak postselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order transition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly symmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases and their transitions for both abelian $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$ symmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with measurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent in the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum channels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the degeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries. Our results demonstrate robust SW-SSB phases and their transitions in the steady states of noisy quantum operations, and provide a framework for realizing various kinds of mixed-state quantum phases based on their symmetries."

First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\\!+\\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \\textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs."

However, when post-measurement states depend on many non-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and using the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new approach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create short-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a superconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range entanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the others. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on observations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more general problems in quantum control."

      "summary": "Performing large-scale, accurate quantum simulations of many-fermion systems is a central challenge in quantum science, with applications in chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics. Despite significant progress, realizing generic fermionic algorithms with qubit systems incurs significant space-time overhead, scaling as O(N) for N fermionic modes. Here we present a method for faster fermionic simulation with asymptotic space-time overhead of O(log(N)) in the worst case, and O(1) for circuits with additional structure, including important subroutines like the fermionic fast Fourier transform. This exponential reduction is achieved by using reconfigurable quantum systems with non-local connectivity, mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedforward, to generate dynamical fermion-to-qubit mappings. We apply this technique to achieve efficient compilation for key simulation tasks, including Hamiltonian simulation of the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and periodic materials, as well as free-fermion state-preparation. Moreover, we show that the algorithms themselves can be adapted to use only the O(1)-overhead structures to further reduce resource overhead. These techniques can lower gate counts by orders of magnitude for practical system sizes and are natively compatible with error corrected computation, making them ideal for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. Our results tightly bound the computational gap between fermionic and qubit models and open new directions in quantum simulation algorithm design and implementation."

Maximizing these advantages requires minimizing both the sensor-target separation and detectable signalthreshold. However, leading platforms such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond suffer performance degradation near surfaces or in nanoscale volumes, motivating the search for optically addressable spin sensors in atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we present an experimental framework to probe a novel 2D spin ensemble, including its Hamiltonian, coherent sensing dynamics, and noise environment. Using a central spin system in a 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal, we fully map the hyperfine interactions with proximal nuclear spins, demonstrate programmable switching between magnetic and electric sensing, and introduce a robust method for reconstructing the environmental noise spectrum explicitly accounting for quantum control imperfections. We achieve a record coherence time of 80 $\\mu$s and nanotesla-level AC magnetic sensitivity at a 10 nm target distance, reaching the threshold for detecting a single nuclear spin in nanoscale spectroscopy. Leveraging the broad opportunities for defect engineering in atomically thin hosts, these results lay the foundation for next-generation quantum sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity, tunable noise selectivity, and versatile quantum functionalities."

      "summary": "Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide band gap, van der Waals material that is highly promising for solid-state quantum technologies as a host of optically addressable, paramagnetic spin defects. Intrinsic and extrinsic point defects provide a range of emission energies, but the atomic-level structures related to observed transitions are not fully characterised. In this work, intrinsic point defects in bulk hBN are modelled using density functional theory at the level of the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA), considering their formation energies, electronic spectra and magnetic properties. The meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional r2SCAN is found to offer a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for specific properties, while its predictive performance for bound-exciton stability is limited when compared to higher-level hybrid functionals. This implies opportunities for its use in optimised, hierarchical computational defect screening workflows. Under revised criteria, VB-, BN0, Bi+ and Ni+ defects are identified as stable colour centres with zero-phonon emission within technologically desirable wavelengths, making them promising for use in quantum networks and sensors."

      "summary": "Plasmons facilitate a strong confinement and enhancement of near-field light, offering exciting opportunities to enhance nonlinear optical responses at the nanoscale. However, despite significant advancements, the electrically tunable range of the nonlinear optical responses at nanometer-scale plasmonic structures remains limited to a few percents per volt. Here, we transcend the limitation of the nanometer regime by expanding the concept of electrophotonics into angstrom-scale platform, enabling high-performance modulation of near-field nonlinear optical responses inaccessible in prior architectures. We demonstrate ~2000% enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) within 1 V of voltage application by utilizing an angstrom-scale plasmonic gap between a metallic tip and a flat metal substrate in a scanning tunneling microscope. Extending this near-field SHG scheme to sum-frequency generation that is accompanied by large frequency upconversion, we also found that such giant electrical modulation of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optical phenomena is effective over mid-infrared to visible broad wavelength range. Our results and concepts lay the foundation for developing near-field-based angstrom-scale nonlinear electrophotonics with significant modulation depth at low driving voltage."

      "summary": "Sum-frequency generation (SFG) is a powerful second-order nonlinear spectroscopic technique that provides detailed insights into molecular structures and absolute orientations at surfaces and interfaces. However, conventional SFG based on far-field schemes suffers from the diffraction limit of light, which inherently averages spectroscopic information over micrometer-scale regions and obscures nanoscale structural inhomogeneity. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by leveraging a highly confined optical near field within a tip-substrate nanogap of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), pushing the spatial resolution of SFG down to ~10 nm, a nearly two-orders-of-magnitude improvement over conventional far-field SFG. By capturing tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectra concurrently with STM scanning, we demonstrate the capability to resolve nanoscale variation in molecular adsorption structures across distinct interfacial domains. To rigorously interpret the observed TE-SFG spectra, we newly developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for the TE-SFG process and confirm via numerical simulations that the TE-SFG response under our current experimental conditions is dominantly governed by the dipole-field interactions, with negligible contributions from higher-order multipole effects. The dominance of the dipole mechanism ensures that the observed TE-SFG spectra faithfully reflect not only nanoscale interfacial structural features but also absolute up/down molecular orientations. This study presents the first experimental realization of diffraction-unlimited second-order nonlinear vibrational SFG nanoscopy, opening a new avenue for nanoscale domain-specific investigation of molecular structures and dynamics within inhomogeneous interfacial molecular systems beyond the conventional far-field SFG and STM imaging."

      "summary": "The synthetic frequency dimension, which realizes fictitious spatial dimensions from the spectral degree of freedom, has emerged as a promising platform for engineering artificial gauge fields in studying quantum simulations and topological physics with photons. A current central task for frequency-domain photons is the creation and manipulation of nontrivial non-Abelian field strength tensors and observing their governing dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a miniaturized scheme for creating non-Abelian electric fields in a photonic frequency chain using a polarization-multiplexed, time-modulated ring resonator. By engineering spin-orbit coupling via modulation dephasing, polarization rotation, and polarization retardation, we achieve programmable control over synthetic Floquet bands and their quasimomentum spin-resolved textures. Leveraging self-heterodyne coherent detection, we demonstrate Zitterbewegung -- a trembling motion of photons -- induced by non-Abelian electric fields on the frequency chain. We further observe the interference between Zitterbewegung and Bloch oscillations arising from the coexistence of non-Abelian and Abelian electric fields. Our work bridges synthetic dimensions with non-Abelian gauge theory for versatile photonic emulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and spinor dynamics, and can be instrumental in applications like frequency-domain optical computation and multimodal frequency comb control."

      "summary": "The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses."

In this work we show that open quantum system consisting of bosonic modes and interacting with bosonic reservoirs can be used as analog coprocessor implementing multiple vector-matrix multiplications with stochastic matrices in parallel. Input vectors are encoded in occupancies of reservoirs, and output result is presented by stationary energy flows. The operation takes time needed for the system's transition to non-equilibrium stationary state independently on number of the reservoirs, i.e., on the input vector dimension. The computations are accompanied by entropy growth. We construct a direct mapping between open quantum systems and electrical crossbar structures, showing that dissipation rates multiplied by OQS's modes frequencies can be seen as conductivities, reservoirs' occupancies can be seen as potentials, and stationary energy flows can be seen as electric currents."

Our model extends the four-stroke engine proposed by Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] by introducing an ergotropy-extracting stroke, resulting in a five-stroke cycle. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine (without the adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate for specific cases (x-x and x-z directions), a definite ordering is obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts."

      "summary": "Chromosomal crossovers play a crucial role in meiotic cell division, as they ensure proper chromosome segregation and increase genetic variability. Experiments have consistently revealed two key observations across species: (i) the number of crossovers per chromosome is typically small, but at least one, and (ii) crossovers on the same chromosome are subject to interference, i.e., they are more separated than expected by chance. These observations can be explained by a recently proposed coarsening model, where the dynamics of droplets associated with chromosomes designate crossovers. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the coarsening model, which we also extend by including material exchanges between droplets, the synaptonemal complex, and the nucleoplasm. We derive scaling laws for the crossover count, which allows us to analyze data across species. Moreover, our model provides a coherent explanation of experimental data across mutants, including the wild-type and zyp1-mutant of A. thaliana. Consequently, the extended coarsening model provides a solid framework for investigating the underlying mechanisms of crossover placement."

However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems."

      "summary": "We show that, for sudden quenches, the work distribution reduces to the statistics of traces of powers of Haar unitaries, which are random unitary matrices drawn uniformly from the unitary group. For translation-invariant quadratic fermionic chains with interactions extending to $m$ neighbors and periodic boundary conditions, the Loschmidt amplitude admits a unitary matrix-model / Toeplitz representation, which yields a work variable of the form $W=\\sum_{r\\le m} a_r\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\,U^r$ (and in models with pairing terms -- superconducting pairing -- additional $b_r\\,\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\,U^r$ terms appear). By invoking multivariate central limit theorems for vectors of traces of unitaries, we obtain a Gaussian distribution for $P(W)$ with variance $\\mathrm{Var}(W)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_r r\\,(a_r^2+b_r^2)$ and asymptotic independence across different powers. We also characterise the conditions under which non-Gaussian tails arise, for example from many interaction terms or their slow decay, as well as the appearance of Fisher--Hartwig singularities. We illustrate these mechanisms in the XY chain. Various numerical diagnostics support the analytical results."

We present the theoretical prediction of a gate tunable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a non magnetic oxide interface as a hallmark of a non-trivial Berry curvature. The observed AHE at low-temperatures in the presence of a planar magnetic field comes from a multiband low-energy model with a generalized Rashba interaction that supports characteristic out-of-plane spin and orbital textures. We also discuss strategies for reconstructing the Berry curvature from the AHE non-linearities in (111) SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure interfaces."

      "summary": "In dense systems of hard-interacting colloidal particles having anisotropic shapes, crystallization pathways represent an interesting frontier. The translational and rotational dynamics of such particles become coupled at higher densities, resulting in complex kinetics of their configurational ordering. To elucidate this, we have studied a two-dimensional entropic system of osmotically compressed corner-rounded Brownian square platelets. By analyzing the translational and orientational dynamics of the particles and their respective contributions toward minimizing the free energy, we show that the range of accessible orientational states of the particles principally governs the pathways of structural evolution, as the orientational entropy dictates the minimization of the free energy and, hence, the resulting optimal equilibrium ordering. When the particles have access to a wider range of orientational states, the larger rotational component of configurational entropy minimizes the total free energy, leading to hexagonal ordering. At higher osmotic pressures, the long collective translational fluctuations of the side-aligned particles with restricted rotational fluctuations maximize the entropy with a greater contribution from the translational component, thereby inducing a free energetically favored rhombic crystalline structure. We further show that density influences the crystallization pathways indirectly by setting an upper bound on the range of accessible orientational states. Complementary Brownian dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations further corroborate our findings, and their generalizability is demonstrated using a system of triangular particles. Thus, orientational dynamics is predicted to play a crucial role in governing the pathways for entropic ordering of various anisotropic shapes."

We propose a novel interband mechanism, linked to the negative curvature of energy dispersions, which successfully accounts for the observed anomalous response. This negative curvature originates from energy variation along the nodal line, inherent in realistic nodal-line materials. Our results suggest that such orbital paramagnetism provides strong evidence for the presence of nodal lines in ZrSiS, and serves as a hallmark of other nodal-line materials."

It has recently been observed in PtBi$_2$ that such Fermi arc states can become superconducting, with a critical temperature larger than that of the bulk. Here we introduce a general variational method that captures the interplay between surface and bulk superconductivity, for any bulk Hamiltonian that harbors (topological) surface states with varying penetration depth. From the self-consistent solutions we establish that the surface state localization length of Weyl semimetals leads to characteristic features in the surface superconductivity, with a gap depending on surface momentum and a penetration length for the order parameter that is temperature-dependent due to competition with the bulk superconductivity."

      "summary": "Ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity of polymers generally increases with chain length. However, for polyproline (PPro), a highly potent cryoprotectant, the IRI activity varies nonmonotonically with the degree of polymerization (DP), i.e., DP=8 (P8) > DP=15 (P15) > DP=3 (P3). Herein, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the microscopic mechanism behind this nonmonotonic effect in PPro. Our findings indicate that the population of the PPII helix structure, which increases with DP, is not the primary reason for this effect. Instead, both single-molecule conformation and multi-molecule aggregation play critical roles. At the single-molecule level, PPro exhibits two types of thermodynamically stable conformations:linear (L) and coil (C), with the latter demonstrating enhanced IRI potency due to its stronger hydrophobicity and ice-binding capability. Notably, P8 has a higher content of the C conformation compared to P15, accounting for its superior IRI activity. Aligning with the conventional understandings, P3's lowest activity stems from its excessively small volume/coverage area on the ice surface. At the multi-molecule level, P15 shows a significantly higher tendency to aggregate than P8, which limits the ability of PPro molecules to fully spread at the ice-water interface and reduces their effective coverage of the ice surface, thereby diminishing its effectiveness. And P15's aggregation becomes significantly pronounced at high concentrations, amplifying the nonmonotonic effect. This work provides an atomistic insight into the nonmonotonic relationship between IRI activity and DP in PPro, offering valuable insights for the rational design of novel biocompatible antifreeze polymers."

In this letter we explore the thermal-noise limits to frequency stability in burned spectral holes. We compile known material parameters for a typical system used in SHB experiments (Eu 3+ doped Y 2 SiO 5 ) to make numerical estimates for the fundamental thermal-noise induced frequency instability in spectral-holes for the liquid-helium temperature and dilution temperature cases. These efforts can guide the design of future SHB experiments and clarify which important material parameters remain to be measured."

In this work, we predict that in such magnetic topological systems, the interaction between electrons and magnons substantially destabilizes the Weyl nodes, leading to a topological phase transition below the Curie temperature. Remarkably, the sensitivity of the Weyl nodes to electron-magnon interaction depends on their spin chirality. We find that Weyl nodes with a trivial chirality are more sensitive to electron-magnon interactions than Weyl nodes presenting an inverted chirality, demonstrating the resilience of the latter compared to the former. Our results open perspectives for the interpretation of the transport signatures of Weyl semimetals, especially close to the Curie temperature."

Our analysis demonstrates that such interaction-free ergodicity breaking arises generically whenever a global constraint is imposed and the driving noise is class-I hyperuniform, the strongest form in Torquato's classification. The transition can also be interpreted as a condensation of fluctuations into the zero-frequency mode, reminiscent of Bose--Einstein condensation in an ideal gas."

      "summary": "Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization -- even in the absence of external magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes -- axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters -- our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of $10^{-1}$ Tesla per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for the driving force underlying spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or unphysically enhanced spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results provide a new perspective that offers a unifying framework with the potential to reconcile many existing hypotheses and theoretical models, while also suggesting several testable predictions that can be examined experimentally."

In this work, we present computational predictions of stability and electronic structure for 448 compositions within the pyrochlore (A2B2O7) and spinel (AB2O4) frameworks. Of these, 92 are predicted to be thermodynamically stable or close (< 100 meV/atom) to the convex hull, with trends deviating from expectations based on ionic radius-ratio rules. Thirteen are predicted to adopt a ferromagnetic ground state among the collinear configurations considered. Two additional materials meeting these criteria were also identified from open materials databases. Calculations of anomalous Hall angles (AHA) and conductivities reveal that 11 of the screened materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring high electronic conductivity and a giant AHE. Our results suggest that the AHA can be further enhanced by tuning the Fermi level, for example through chemical doping. Using this approach, we identify five materials whose AHA exceed 0.2 under the approximation of collinear magnetism. Notably, Ag2Pt2O7 exhibits a high AHA of 0.405 when its Fermi level is optimized. These findings provide a roadmap for the targeted synthesis of new pyrochlore and spinel compounds with enhanced AHE properties. They also broaden the compositional design space for these structures and support the discovery of high-performance materials for next-generation spintronic applications."

Understanding this behavior is essential for fundamental science and practical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. This study examines the aging of low-concentration Laponite suspensions with varying salt concentrations using fluorescence microscopy, scattering imaging, and particle tracking microrheology. Structural heterogeneity appeared earlier at higher salt concentrations, and the average size of aggregates decreased as the salt concentration increased further. Fourier transform analysis corroborated these trends, and scattering images showed similar results. Microrheology revealed distinct dynamics in Laponite-rich and Laponite-poor regions: the poor phase exhibited liquid-like behavior, while the rich phase exhibited gel-like properties. Further analysis suggested the presence of submicron or nanoscale structural heterogeneities within the rich phase. These findings provide insight into how aging and salt concentration shape the structure and dynamics of colloidal gels."

Van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged in this context as a versatile platform to explore the interplay between these two competing orders. Here, we report on individual NbSe2/NiPS3/NbSe2 vdW Josephson junctions behaving as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which we attribute to the interplay between the superconductivity of NbSe2 and the spin texture of the vdW antiferromagnetic insulator NiPS3. The SQUID behavior, which persists for in-plane magnetic fields of at least 6 T, is the result of interference between localized transport channels that form in two separate regions of the sample. Microscopic modeling of the antiferromagnet insulator/superconductor (AFI/S) interface reveals the formation of localized states at the edges of the junction that can lead to localized channels that dominate the transport. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW superconducting heterostructures with AFs as platforms for engineering and probing novel superconducting phenomena, and they establish a new route for lithographic-free SQUIDs that operate in high magnetic fields."

      "summary": "In this letter we consider the time dependent Kondo model where a magnetic impurity interacts with the electrons through a time dependent interaction strength $J(t)$. We develop a new framework based on Bethe ansatz and construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We show that when periodic boundary conditions are applied, the consistency of the solution results in a constraint equation which relates the amplitudes corresponding to a certain ordering of the particles in the configuration space. This constraint equation takes the form of a matrix difference equation, and the associated consistency conditions restrict the interaction strength $J(t)$ for the system to be integrable. For a given $J(t)$ satisfying these constraints, the solution to the matrix difference equations provides the exact many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We provide a concrete example of $J(t)$ which satisfies these constraint equations. We show that in this case, the matrix difference equations turn into quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations, which are well studied in the literature. The framework developed in this work allows one to probe the non-equilibrium physics of the Kondo model, and being general, it also allows one to solve new class of Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strength which are based on quantum Yang-Baxter algebra."

      "summary": "One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength."

      "summary": "Neural network wave functions have shown promise as a way to achieve high accuracy on the many-body quantum problem. These wave functions most commonly use a determinant or sum of determinants to antisymmetrize many-body orbitals which are described by a neural network. In many cases, the wave function is projected onto a fixed-spin state. Such a treatment is allowed for spin-independent operators; however, it cannot be applied to spin-dependent problems, such as Hamiltonians containing spin-orbit interactions. We show that for spin-independent Hamiltonians, a strict upper bound property is obeyed between a traditional Hartree-Fock like determinant, full spinor wave function, the full determinant wave function, and a generalized spinor wave function. The relationship between a spinor wave function and the full determinant arises because the full determinant wave function is the spinor wave function projected onto a fixed-spin, after which antisymmetry is implicitly restored in the spin-independent case. For spin-dependent Hamiltonians, the full determinant wave function is not applicable, because it is not antisymmetric. Numerical experiments on the H$_3$ molecule and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas confirm the bounds."

Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we find that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a range of chemical potentials around the Weyl nodes. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave Cooper pairing in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we find a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the Fermi arcs, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states."

This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation."

      "summary": "Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that exhibit topological stability, which, along with novel thermal and electrical transport properties, make them the ideal candidates for a variety of novel technological applications. Accessing the skyrmion spin texture at the nanoscale and understanding its interaction with local thermal gradients is essential for engineering skyrmion-based transport phenomena. However, direct experimental insight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains limited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM) to probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion. By mapping the local thermoelectric voltage with nanoscale precision, we reveal a unique spatially resolved response that is the convolution of the underlying spin texture of the skyrmion and its interaction with the highly localised thermal gradient originating from the heated probe. We combine this with thermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique thermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a tool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with local thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport. We demonstrate a novel route to characterise nanoscale spin textures, accelerating the material optimisation cycle, while also opening the possibility to harness skyrmions for spin caloritronics."

However, their application to polar materials can be challenging, particularly when longitudinal-optical phonon modes are active on the material, as accurately modeling such systems requires incorporating the long-range part of the dipole-dipole interactions. In this study, we challenge the influence of these interactions on the properties of polar materials taking BaTiO$_3$ as paradigmatic example. By comparing models with and without the long-range part of the electrostatic contributions in a systematic way, we demonstrate that even if these interactions are neglected, the models can still provide an overall good description of the material, though they may lead to punctual significant artifacts. Our results propose a pathway to identify when an atomistic potential may be inadequate and needs to be corrected through the inclusion of the long-range part of dipolar interactions."

However, for a factorizable $q$ value, dynamic modes with skipping states emerge, depending on the contact energies. For $q=6$, a spiral wave mode with three domain types (one state dominant or two states mixed) and cyclic changes in three homogeneous phases are found. Although three states can coexist spatially under thermal equilibrium, the scaling exponents of the transitions to the wave modes are modified from the equilibrium values."

It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process."

In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and check experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\\\"averstam et al. and by Lupascu et al..

      "summary": "Computational hardware designed to mimic biological neural networks holds the promise to resolve the drastically growing global energy demand of artificial intelligence. A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity. However, existing solutions have large circuit footprints limiting scaling potential and they miss key biological functions, like inhibition. We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function. It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing. This work paves the way for two important research paths: photonic neuromorphic computing with nanosized footprints and low power consumption, and adaptive optical sensing, using the same architecture as a compact, modular front end"

      "summary": "$\\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, a nickelate compound with a reported superconducting transition temperature of $\\rm 80~K$, has attracted significant attention in recent years. Density-wave phenomena arising from strong electron correlations are widely regarded as key to unraveling the superconductivity mechanism, but the ordering and stability of these density waves remain a subject of contention in existing theoretical studies. In this work, we employ the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method to thoroughly examine the nature of density waves as functions of Coulomb repulsion and exchange interactions in bilayer two-orbital model proposed for the high pressure phase of $\\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$. We analyse the spin and charge correlation functions in a wide range of parameter space, and delineate a schematic phase diagram that separates different density-wave ground states. Our results provide useful insights into the understanding of electron correlations in $\\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, and highlight the potential of VMC to elucidate its superconducting mechanism."

      "summary": "The paths of swift heavy ions are typically traceable in solids, because of confined electronic interactions along the paths, inducing what is known in literature as 'ion tracks', i.e. nano-sized in cross-section cylindrical zones of modified material extending for microns in length. Such tracks readily form in materials exhibiting low thermal conductivities, in particular insulators or semiconductors, altering the homogeneity of materials. In this work, using recently discovered gamma/beta-Ga2O3 polymorph heterostructures we show that, in contrast to the trends in many other materials, including that in beta-Ga2O3, swift heavy ions leave no tracks in gamma-Ga2O3. We explained this trend in terms of amazingly fast disorder recovery, occurring because of multiple configurations in the gamma-Ga2O3 lattice itself, so that the disorder formed by ion impacts gets rapidly erased, giving a perception of ions leaving no tracks. As such, gamma-Ga2O3, readily integrated with beta-Ga2O3 in polymorph heterostructures, may become a promising semiconductor platform for devices capable to operate in extremely harsh radiation environments."

Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of light-induced $\\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases. Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\\pm$3), followed by another TPT that yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational band-inversion process, which is determined by $\\pm$1 orders of replica bands. Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by the large global gaps ($\\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive roadmap towards the designer $\\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation, facilitating applications of artificial topological materials."

The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations.

We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code.

The corresponding Gibbs measures belong to the exponential family parametrized by (inverse) temperature $\\beta>0$ and external field $h\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Given a sample from these Gibbs measures, a statistically fundamental question is to infer the temperature and external field parameters. In 2007, Chatterjee (Ann.

It was left open whether the same method can be used to estimate the temperature and external field simultaneously. In this paper, under some easily verifiable conditions, we prove that the bivariate maximum pseudolikelihood estimator is indeed jointly $\\sqrt{N}$-consistent for the temperature and external field parameters. The examples cover the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and its diluted variants."

Here, we show that neural networks trained in the rich, feature learning infinite-width regime in two different settings are also described by kernel machines, but with data-dependent kernels. For both cases, we provide explicit expressions for the kernel predictors and prescriptions to numerically calculate them. To derive the first predictor, we study the large-width limit of feature-learning Bayesian networks, showing how feature learning leads to task-relevant adaptation of layer kernels and preactivation densities. The saddle point equations governing this limit result in a min-max optimization problem that defines the kernel predictor. To derive the second predictor, we study gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay in the infinite-width limit using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The fixed point equations of the arising DMFT defines the task-adapted internal representations and the kernel predictor. We compare our kernel predictors to kernels derived from lazy regime and demonstrate that our adaptive kernels achieve lower test loss on benchmark datasets."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena."

In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems."

In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the R\\'enyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal."

      "summary": "Nature Communications, Published online: 10 September 2025; doi:10.1038/s41467-025-62710-0 Enfortumab vedotin (EV), an antibody-drug conjugate that targets NECTIN4, has become the new standard of care treatment for patients with advanced bladder cancer, which is also known as urothelial carcinoma (UC). Although EV has proven to be very effective both as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients unfortunately develop resistance to EV after about 1 year, which calls for the need to develop new treatment options. In this study, we developed a NECTIN4-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, and showed that it was highly effective against bladder cancer cells expressing NECTIN4. We previously found that patient tumors ranged from negative to very high levels of NECTIN4. We showed that cells with higher. NECTIN4 levels were more easily targeted by the CAR T cell. Interestingly, stimulating the PPARγ pathway using small molecules like rosiglitazone (an old diabetes drug) was effective at increasing NECTIN4 expression, particularly in UC cells with lower NECTIN4 levels. This translated into enhanced NECTIN4-CAR T killing in vitro and in mouse tumor xenografts. Moreover, we found that NECTIN4 is largely retained on tumors after patients become resistant to EV, and we developed EV-resistant cell lines to study this. Importantly, NECTIN4-CAR T cells remained effective even against these EV-resistant cancer cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that NECTIN4-CAR T cells are effective, whose activity can be further enhanced by repurposing a diabetes drug, rosiglitazone, to induce NECTIN4. Our findings may pave the way to new therapeutic approaches for bladder cancer patients in the future."

      "summary": "This work models cytoplasm as a soft colloidal suspension with active noise. It’s found that to reproduce the 1/2 frequency scaling of the experimental complex shear moduli, the cytoplasm should be slightly above the jamming transition and be fluidized by active noise. The results suggest that the cell actively regulates volume fraction into this regime, allowing its viscoelastic properties to be sensitively tuned by intracellular active processes. [Phys. Rev.
