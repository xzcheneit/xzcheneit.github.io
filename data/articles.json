These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $\\lambda$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $\\lambda$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials."

We demonstrate that, for systems with perfectly linear dispersion, there exists a clear and rigorous separation of the quantum geometric from the ordinary band velocity contributions to the diffusion constant, which turns out to be directly related to the separation of a rank two tensor into transverse and longitudinal parts. We also demonstrate that the diffusion constant of three-dimensional Dirac fermions at charge neutrality is entirely quantum geometric in origin, which is not the case for two-dimensional Dirac fermions. This is the result of an accidental perfect cancellation of the band velocity contribution in three dimensions."

      "summary": "Recently, a host of exotic magnetic textures such as topologically protected skyrmion lattices has been discovered in several bulk metallic lanthanide compounds. In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moir\\'{e} superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \\textit{i.e.}, spin moir\\'{e} superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \\textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states. Our experimental probes and theoretical modeling definitively characterize three different and tunable phases in one material, and provide insight for the design of new topological spin-texture materials."

In this paper, we characterize the incommensurate phases accessible with field applied in the plane with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). A variety of phases with unusual SANS patterns are accessible with magnetic field applied along the $a$ and $a^*$ directions. Many of these phases can be understood to be multi-$q$ phases. One phase in particular, ICM2b (ICM=incommensurate magnetic phase), is rather unconventional in that it is an anisotropic multi-$q$ phase that can rotate freely within the $ab$-plane, dependent on magnetic field direction and history. The stabilization of tunable multi-$q$ incommensurate spin textures \\textit{via} in-plane field sets this class of materials apart from conventional skyrmion materials. We further identify that the propagation vectors of the in-plane phases have a significant commensuration with the diameter of the smallest pocket of the Fermi surface ($2k_{\\text{F}}$). The multi/single-$q$ nature is also correlated with the enhancement of resistivity, suggesting that a gap opens in the electron bands at $q=2k_{\\text{F}}$. We also compare with a phenomenological model of the phase diagram. The richness of phases revealed in this study hint at the frustrated nature of the incommensurate magnetism present in EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ and motivate further probes of these phases and the origin of the stability of spin moir\\'{e} superlattices. Finally, the coupling of the multi-$q$ nature and $q=2k_{\\text{F}}$ commensuration condition reveals the key requirements for a strong SMS transport response."

      "summary": "The progress of magnonics ultimately depends on material platforms that offer precise control of spin waves propagation. Here, we put forward a chemical strategy to create locally tunable magnonic crystals by integrating switchable spin-crossover (SCO) molecules with 2D van der Waals magnets. Specifically, we investigate from first principles a hybrid molecular/2D heterostructure formed by [Fe((3,5-(CH3)2Pz)3BH)2] molecules (Fe-pz) deposited on a single-layer of semiconducting CrSBr. We show that Fe-pz molecules are stable on CrSBr while preserving its SCO bistability, particularly in densely packed molecular arrays. By patterning Fe-pz into periodic stripes separated by pristine CrSBr regions, the interface becomes a magnonic crystal that filters spin waves at selected frequencies. Crucially, light-driven excited spin-state trapping (LIESST) enables LS-HS switching and induces up to ~1.3% local strain in CrSBr, which in turn reshapes the magnonic band structure in a dynamic and reversible manner. These results establish Fe-pz@CrSBr as a switchable platform for on-chip, programmable magnonic devices."

      "summary": "We uncover four exotic coupled spin-charge ground states in the strong coupling limit of the Kondo lattice model at various electronic fillings on a frustrated decorated honeycomb lattice, where each regular honeycomb sublattice point is occupied by three-site triangular units. We employ a hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo (hMCMC) simulation method which combines classical MCMC for localized spins and exact diagonalization of the electronic Hamiltonian. Two of the spin-charge ground states, respectively consists of three-site and six-site ferromagnetic (FM) clusters arranged in anti-FM and $120^{\\circ}$ Yafet-Kittel (YK) phase which we label as S-AF (super-antiferromagnet) and S-YK (super-YK) respectively. Two even more interesting coupled spin-charge states, respectively accommodate FM dimers and trimers (as three-site line segment), which we label as FM-D and FM-T. In both cases, the anti-FM aligned dimers and trimers in respective phases, are arranged in stripes along one of three lattice directions: the spontaneously symmetry broken phases giving rise to non-trivial macroscopic degeneracy. These underlying magnetic textures (except S-YK state) restrict electrons in fragmented small regions (e.g, triangular units, two-site dimers, three-site line segments respectively in S-AF, FM-D and FM-T), resulting in flat bands by opening large gaps in electronic density of states, which in turn stabilize these coupled spin-charge states: a \"band effect\". These exotic spin-charge ground states could be relevant to electron-doped spin-systems resulting from various metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have attracted significant attention to condensed matter physics"

Some elementary liquid metals, such as gallium, show unusual behaviors in thermodynamic and transport properties as a result of their complex atomic structure and dynamics. In this work, we study the real-space atomic correlation function of liquid gallium by neutron scattering. In the pair-distribution function, there exist two kinds of medium-range order (MRO), characterized by oscillations beyond the first nearest neighbors. On the other hand, the first neighbor shell shows only one kind of bond. The two types of MRO are strongly overlapping in space and fluctuating in time. We propose that they are the basis for anomalous behavior of liquid gallium. This view challenges the current view that liquid gallium consists of fluctuating metallic and insulating domains. These findings shed new light on the interpretation of similar microscopic anomalies observed in other semi-metallic liquids."

      "summary": "Gallium is a prototypical liquid metal and has gained renewed attention due to its unique properties. Characterizing and elucidating its atomic dynamics remains elusive despite numerous studies, primarily due to the challenges of quantifying atomic-scale dynamics in liquids. Recent developments in inelastic neutron scattering enable us to measure the Van Hove correlation function that describes the real-space motion of liquid atoms. In this work, we use this approach to reveal the dynamics in gallium liquids and find the co-existence of two dynamical medium-range orders (MROs), which have a dynamical behavior distinct from that of the short-range order (SRO). We propose that these MROs are driven by global forces in the form of two density waves, as a direct consequence of the underlying competition between ionic core repulsion and valence electron cohesion. We suggest that the density wave approach is not only applicable to other metallic liquids exhibiting similar structural anomalies, but also offers a promising direction for elucidating the dynamics of complex liquids and glasses by linking electronic-state fluctuations to atomic dynamics."

      "summary": "Metallic kagome systems have attracted considerable interest in recent years, as they provide a rich platform for studying phenomena associated with their distinctive band structure. The coexistence of bands with Dirac points similar to those in graphene, along with a completely flat band, makes this an ideal structure for investigating how lattice symmetries may protect topological and many-body correlation effects. Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system. These results demonstrate that strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities."

Although bacterial motility has been studied in porous media, the roles of cell length and pore shape in navigating these environments remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how cell morphology and pore architecture jointly determine bacterial spreading behavior. Using genetically engineered E. coli with tunable cell length, we performed single-cell tracking in microfluidic devices that mimic ordered and disordered porous structures. We find that elongated bacteria traverse ordered pore networks more effectively than short cells, exhibiting straighter paths, greater directional persistence, and enhanced exploration efficiency. In contrast, in disordered porous media, elongated bacteria become trapped in dead-end regions for extended periods, resulting in markedly reduced navigational efficiency. Together, these results reveal how cell shape and environmental geometry interact to govern bacterial transport. Moreover, we suggest a new mechanism for separating antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria from elongated susceptible cells in designer porous media."

      "summary": "One of the distinguishing features of an altermagnet is that its spin-up and spin-down bands display a nodal momentum-dependent splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. While this property has been investigated in many weakly-correlated altermagnetic materials, the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure has remained little explored, particularly in metals. Here, we propose NiS2 as a prototypical strongly correlated metallic altermagnet. While at ambient pressure this compound is an altermagnetic Mott insulator, it undergoes a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) while maintaining its altermagnetic ordered phase. By systematically comparing DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT, we disentangle how strong static and dynamic correlations modify the electronic structure. Specifically, the spin splitting of the bands is modified not only through the enhancement of the local magnetic moment caused by static correlations, but also by the momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization caused by dynamic correlations. Moreover, dynamic electronic correlations cause a pronounced lifetime asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles, an effect that is amplified by the particle-hole asymmetry promoted by Hund's correlations. Our results not only shed light on the rich landscape of correlation effects in metallic altermagnets, but also establishes NiS2 as a platform to investigate the interplay between Mott and Hund physics and altermagnetic order."

These comprehensive benchmarks validate the accuracy of ccECPs within the CC, CI, and QMC methodologies, thus providing accurate and tested valence-only Hamiltonians for many-body electronic structure calculations."

      "summary": "Kagome lattice bilayers offer unique opportunities for engineering electronic properties through interlayer stacking and strain. We report a comprehensive first-principles study of Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ kagome bilayers, examining four stacking configurations (AA, AA$'$, AB, AB$'$). Our calculations reveal dramatic stacking-dependent band gap modulation from 0.08 to 0.76~eV, with the AB$'$ configuration being the most thermodynamically stable. All stackings exhibit robust mechanical stability with Young's moduli of 54.82-61.97~N/m and ductile behavior suitable for flexible electronics. Carrier effective masses show significant stacking dependence, ranging from 2.39-6.35~$m_0$ for electrons and 0.67-1.55~$m_0$ for holes. Strain engineering of the AB$'$ bilayer demonstrates non-monotonic band gap tuning and asymmetric modulation of carrier masses, with hole effective masses showing stronger strain sensitivity. These results establish Pd$_3$O$_2$Cl$_2$ bilayers as a promising platform for strain-engineered kagome-based quantum devices, where stacking order and mechanical deformation provide complementary control over electronic transport."

      "summary": "What are the fundamental limitations for finite-time engines that extract work from active nonequilibrium systems, and what are the optimal protocols that approach them? We show that the finite-time work extraction for nonconservative overdamped Langevin systems may be rewritten as a Lorentz force Lagrangian action, with the kinetic term corresponding to a thermodynamic metric term that is an $L_2$-optimal transport cost for the time-dependent probability density, and the magnetic field coupling term corresponding to an effective quasistatic work extraction, proving that optimal protocols counterdiabatically steer the thermodynamic state trajectory to satisfy a Lorentz force law defined on thermodynamic state space. We utilize and reinterpret classic concepts from electromagnetism in the setting of cyclical nonequilibrium processes. We show that the housekeeping heat can be controlled to be arbitrarily close to zero by minimizing nonequilibrium fluctuations. It immediately follows from our results that the constant-velocity angle clamp protocol applied to the $F_1$ molecular motor in a recent experiment [Mishima et at, 2025] is in fact the globally optimal protocol: it produces zero housekeeping heat and simultaneously minimizes dissipation and maximizes work transduction."

      "summary": "Josephson junctions (JJs), devices consisting of two superconductors separated by a barrier, are of great technological importance, being a cornerstone of quantum information processing. Classical understanding of superconductor-insulator-superconductor JJs is that conventional insulator's properties, other than magnetism, do not significantly influence the junction's behavior. However, recent work on quantum material (QM) JJs - using Mott insulator Nb3Br8 - resulted in magnetic field-free non-reciprocal superconductivity, termed the Josephson diode effect (JDE), implying the QM's intrinsic properties can modulate superconductivity in non-trivial ways. To date, the underlying mechanism and dependence of the JDE on correlation strength (U/t) has not been elucidated. Here we fabricate QMJJs using correlated Kagome insulators with varying U/t, Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I), observing a decreasing trend of the field-free JDE with Nb3Cl8 reaching ~48% efficiency, Nb3Br8 ~6%, and Nb3I8 having no discernible JDE, matching the trend of decreasing U/t from Cl to I and suggesting correlation in insulators drives the field-free JDE."

Phonon dispersion calculations show no imaginary modes, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at 1000~K confirm robust thermal stability without bond breaking. Electronic structure analysis reveals metallic character, with multiple bands crossing the Fermi level and dominant contributions from carbon p orbitals, consistent with a fully delocalized 3D $\\pi$-conjugated network. The optical response is anisotropic, exhibiting strong absorption in the visible and ultraviolet regions and low reflectivity across a broad range of photon energies.

Incorporating Ga into EuZn$_2$P$_2$ (EuZn$_{1.8}$Ga$_{0.2}$P$_2$) reduces the electrical resistivity, indicating enhanced free-carrier density and a narrowed semiconducting gap. ESR confirms the persistence of Eu$^{2+}$ moments while showing a crossover from a Lorentzian to a Dysonian lineshape, consistent with reduced skin depth, increased carrier density, and the emergence of diffusive contributions. Ga-substituted compound display pronounced negative magnetoresistance linked to magnetic-polaron formation. THz-TDS reveals strong low-frequency absorption and a notable enhancement of the Drude conductivity in the substituted material, together with an increased carrier scattering time and enhanced carrier-density--to--effective-mass ratio. These results demonstrate that Ga substitution tunes charge transport, carrier dynamics, and short-range magnetic correlations in EuZn$_2$P$_2$, establishing EuZn$_{1.8}$Ga$_{0.2}$P$_2$ as a promising platform for engineering correlated narrow-gap magnetic semiconductors with enhanced electronic and spin-dependent functionalities."

The $\\alpha$-relaxation time in the aging regime reveals non-monotonic finite-size effects with a peak at an intermediate system size, which, as far as we know, are not found in the equilibrium systems, and the peak position shifts to larger system sizes with decreasing temperature and increasing waiting time, indicating a growth of a characteristic length scale with waiting time. The extracted correlation volume associated with amorphous order increases logarithmically with the waiting time. Detailed analysis of the dependence of the length scale on waiting time allowed us to estimate the static length scale in the deep supercooled liquid regime. The dynamic length scale, obtained from FSS and block analysis of the four-point dynamic susceptibility, follows a power-law growth with waiting time. The values of the length scales obtained agree well with those obtained from different spatial correlation functions."

      "summary": "Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes were first proposed in 1976 as topologically protected zero-energy states localized at domain walls in one-dimensional Dirac systems. They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments. We find that the fidelity of braiding operation reaches unity when the current noise is fully suppressed, while this braiding fidelity monotonously decreases with the increasing of the current noise. Based on these transport signatures, we further discuss the correspondence between Majorana and Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, highlighting their similarity in supporting non-Abelian statistics."

The model explicitly represents all co-infection states and features absorbing recovered compartments for both diseases. Within a mean-field network approximation, we derive the basic reproduction number of the coupled system and show that invasion thresholds coincide with those of two independent SIR processes. Exploiting an exchange symmetry in the equal-transmission regime, we reduce the dynamics to a lower-dimensional invariant subsystem and analyze the impact of the co-infection recovery rate. We prove that slower recovery of co-infected individuals monotonically increases the co-infection burden and yields a lower bound on epidemic duration that grows as the co-infection recovery rate decreases. Numerical simulations further indicate that reduced co-infection recovery can increase the epidemic peak, an effect supported by a sensitivity-equation analysis. Together, these results highlight how co-infection-specific recovery dynamics can substantially alter transient epidemic behavior, even in the absence of endemic equilibria."

The anomalous Nernst coefficient strongly depends not only on the Tb composition but also on the transition metal composition, reaching a maximum of 1.8 uV/K for amo. Tb11.0(Fe50.0Co50.0) 89.0. By evaluating the electrical and thermoelectric properties, it was clarified that this maximum is achieved by the superposition of two large contributions: S_1 arising from direct transverse electron conduction due to a temperature gradient, and S_2 resulting from the combined Seebeck and anomalous Hall effects. We discovered that the anomalous Nernst conductivity, which is attributed to Berry curvature, varied significantly with the transition metal, even in an amorphous material lacking long-range crystalline order. Our research indicates that it is possible to control the electronic states that influence thermoelectric properties, even in the amorphous state."

The core level spectroscopy shows that the substitution with Yb ions in the series first occurs on the compact S1 site. For $x\\leq1$, Yb is found to be dominantly Yb$^{2+}$ with a small mixing of Yb$^{3+}$, while for $x>1$, a significant increase of Yb$^{3+}$ is found, suggesting not only that site S2 favours Yb$^{3+}$, but also that their presence affects also the valency of the ions in site S1. The valence band spectra shows a relatively deep Yb$^{2+}$ doublet, but at the same time indications of a Ta~$5d$-Yb~$4f$ interaction are found, suggesting the presence of Yb~$4f$ carriers at the Fermi level through this hybridization. Our results thus point towards an exotic form of $d$-$f$ electronic interplay that together with the structural degrees of freedom can result in the unusual trends observed in the physical properties of Ba$_{3-x}$Yb$_x$Ta$_{5}$O$_{15}$."

The system segregates at low activities, while at high activities it undergoes remixing which is a characteristic feature of semi-flexible active filaments. We show that collision-induced softening of single filaments is the dominant mode for this remixing. We provide a scaling argument for the lowering of the active polymer stiffness and show that it agrees well with the lowering of the segregation order parameter. We expect that our studies will shed light on the spatial organization of biofilaments within the cell, on the plasma-membrane, and beyond, and help in the design of novel biomaterials whose structure can be tuned via the properties of the active or the passive filaments."

The wavelet-transform radial distribution function (WT-RDF) offers a physics-based framework for analyzing amorphous structures, reliably predicting the first and second RDF peaks and overall curve trends in both binary Ge 0.25 Se 0.75 and ternary Ag x(Ge 0.25 Se 0.75)100-x (x=5,10,15,20,25) systems. Despite these strengths, WT-RDF shows limitations in amplitude accuracy, which affects quantitative analyses such as coordination numbers. This study addresses the issue by optimizing WT-RDF parameters using a machine learning approach, producing the enhanced WT-RDF+ framework. WT-RDF+ improves the precision of peak predictions and outperforms benchmark ML models, including RBF and LSTM, even when trained on only 25 percent of the binary dataset. These results demonstrate that WT-RDF+ is a robust and reliable model for structural characterization of amorphous materials, particularly Ge-Se systems, and support the efficient design and development of phase-change thin films for next-generation electronic devices and components."

Coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnets with Kagome lattice spin geometries host vector spin chirality (VSC), the handedness of spin arrangement, and offer an excellent platform for chirality-driven phase control. However, the microscopic mechanisms governing VSC switching and its coupling to magnetic order, electronic structure, and quantum geometry remain elusive, with experimental evidence still lacking. Here, we present conclusive experimental evidence of temperature-driven VSC switching in an archetypal noncollinear antiferromagnetic manganese chromium nitride (Mn3CrN) epitaxial thin films. The VSC switching induces a concomitant quantum-geometric and Lifshitz transition, manifested through a pronounced peak in anomalous Hall conductivity remanence, a metal-insulator-like crossover in longitudinal resistivity, and a distinct evolution of x-ray magnetic circular dichroic signal. The reversal of VSC reconstructs the spin configuration, Fermi surface topology and Berry curvature, marking a unified magnetic-electronic-quantum geometric transition. This emergent behaviour, captured through magneto-transport and magneto-optic measurements, and supported by first-principles theory establish VSC as an active control knob for chirality-driven phase engineering and the design of multifunctional quantum devices."

Soft X-ray time-of-flight photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) provides element- and depth-sensitive information of materials and buried interfaces. However, chromatic and spherical aberrations cannot be corrected with electron-lens combinations. These aberrations, combined with astigmatism and space-charge effects, significantly degrade the spatial and energy resolutions. To overcome this limitation, we outline a spatial-attention based deep learning approach to automatically correct for these effects and attain nanometer resolution over the entire field-of-view (FoV). The combination of this corrective algorithm with XPEEM, termed as nanoXPEEM, establishes a new record of 48-nm spatial resolution with a 232-micrometer diameter FoV in the soft x-ray regime (700-1000 eV). nanoXPEEM provides unique spatial mapping of the element-specificity, depth-sensitivity, and local structure on the nanoscale. It can bridge the current gap to achieve angstrom (atomic) scale resolution."

      "summary": "Efficient charge-carrier injection from air-stable electrodes into organic semiconductors (OSCs) is essential for fabricating solution-processed organic optoelectronic devices under ambient conditions. Today, this is typically achieved by incorporating doped OSC interlayers, introducing self-assembled dipole monolayers, or adding mobile ions to the active material (AM). Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach that eliminates the need for additional injection layers or ionic additives. We achieve this by blending the dipolar compound TMPE-OH into the electroluminescent polymer Super Yellow (SY) and depositing this sole AM between two air-stable electrodes, forming a single-layer, dipole-doped OLED (D-OLED). By tracking its transient voltage-luminance response, performing impedance spectroscopy, and comparing these characteristics with two other single-layer device concepts, i.e. a neat-SY OLED without a dipolar compound and a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) containing mobile ions, we can establish that the auxiliary dipoles in the D-OLED reorient under the applied driving voltage, enabling immediate luminance turn-on and lowering the injection barriers at both electrodes. Finally, we demonstrate that the D-OLED achieves current efficacies comparable to those of SY OLEDs incorporating dedicated injection layers or LECs. Our study establishes dipolar doping as a practical strategy for efficient bipolar charge injection from air-stable electrodes in solution-processed organic semiconductor devices."

      "summary": "From a symmetry perspective, ferroaxial order belongs to the same symmetry as time-reversal-even pseudovectors. Experimentally, ${\\rm K_2Zr(PO_4)_2}$ is known to undergo a displacive-type phase transition from a non-ferroaxial to a ferroaxial phase. To identify the key microscopic ingredients driving this transition, we carry out a quantitative analysis combining density-functional theory calculations and symmetry-adapted closest Wannier analysis. As a result, we show that electric toroidal dipole, electric toroidal octupole, and electric hexadecapole, which belong to the same irreducible representation, make dominant contributions to the ferroaxial transition. In particular, we find that spinless electric toroidal octupoles, which originate from spin-independent off-diagonal real hopping between the $p$ orbitals on P and O atoms and between the $d$ orbitals on Zr atoms and $p$ orbitals on O atoms, provide the most significant contributions. Moreover, we explicitly analyze the orbital characters involved in the relevant hybridizations associated with these multipoles. We further show that the relativistic spin--orbit coupling has a negligible influence on the ferroaxial transition. These results demonstrate that spin-independent orbital hybridization between different orbitals on different atoms plays a crucial role in inducing the ferroaxial transition."

      "summary": "Generating and controlling spin current in miniaturized magnetic quantum devices remains a central objective of spintronics, due to its potential to enable future energy-efficient information technologies. Among the existing magnetic phases, altermagnetism have recently emerged as a highly promising platform for spin current generation and control, going beyond ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Here, we propose a symmetry-allowed spin photovoltaic effect in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic semiconductors that enables predictable control of giant spin injection currents. Distinct from parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$)-antiferromagnets, Janus altermagnetic semiconductors generate not only shift current but also a unique injection current with spin momentum locked in a specific direction under linearly polarized light -- a mechanism absent in $\\mathcal{PT}$-antiferromagnets. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify Janus Fe$_2$SSeO as a promising candidate. Specifically, the monolayer Fe$_2$SSeO exhibits a polarization-dependent injection conductivity reaching $\\sim$1,200~$\\mu$A/V$^{2}\\!\\cdot\\!\\hbar/2e$, and the giant spin injection current can be effectively switched by rotating the magnetization direction and engineering strains. These findings underscore the potential of 2D altermagnets in spin photovoltaics and open avenues for innovative quantum devices."

This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g 0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian ${\\hat H}(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics for different values of $g$, finding qualitatively distinct behaviors for $g > g_c$ (where the chain is in the disordered phase), for $g = g_c$ (QQ across the CQT), and for $g<g_c$ (QQ across the FOQT line)."

Using the low-energy continuum model and incorporating spin-triplet $p_{x}+i p_{y}$ pairing in each graphene layer, we construct the effective models for both tBLG and tDBLG with superconductivity. By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moir\\'e Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moir\\'e band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems. The framework developed here may also be extended to other multilayer moir\\'e materials, offering a route towards engineering exotic topological superconductivity with tunable parameters."

Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering."

Despite Ru's relatively lower oxidation resistance compared to Pt, its significantly lower cost offers potential advantages in cost-sensitive, high-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing Pt-group metal coatings for durability in high-performance systems."

Here, we experimentally uncover the remarkable effect of confinement-induced defect strings termed `grain boundary scars' on the behavior of dense two-dimensional assemblies of granular spinners, a canonical odd elastic solid. We show that the spatial arrangement of these scars fundamentally reshapes the flows triggered by chiral activity. Specifically, they cause the topologically protected edge flows - a ubiquitous feature of confined spinner assemblies - to decouple from the bulk. Strikingly, increasing the net chiral activity of the system by tuning the ratio of counterclockwise to clockwise spinners caused spontaneous self-shearing. The resulting odd radial stresses led to a chiral activity-mediated reentrant melting transition at a fixed areal spinner density. Our findings open new avenues for exploiting geometrical frustration to elicit novel responses from odd elastic solids."

In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas."

An accurate ab initio description is therefore essential. Previous density-functional studies have shown that DFT+$U$ calculations may erroneously favor ferromagnetic order depending on the choice of parametrization, an issue that cannot be remedied by simply adjusting the value of $U$. Here, we demonstrate that an explicit Hubbard correction is unnecessary: the PBE functional correctly reproduces the AFM ground state while simultaneously improving the description of structural properties. Moreover, PBE provides a reliable account of the electronic structure. These findings clarify the role of correlation effects in CrOCl and identify PBE as a robust starting point for future ab initio studies of CrOCl-based materials."

While the altermagnetic unit cell reconstructs the topological edge states in the strip geometry and leads to the emergence of Dirac points, the in-plane magnetic moments of AM can induce gaps at these points. In an open square geometry, corner modes emerge within these gaps, realizing higher-order topological states. We further verify that the induction of higher-order topology is applicable to all altermagnetic configurations constructed here on the Lieb lattice, and is most pronounced for AM by comparing with the other types of magnetism such as ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism.

We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis for this emergent reactance contribution in the frequency regime relevant to transport measurements up to a few GHz. Our analysis reveals that the reactance becomes inductor-like at low frequency below the ferromagnetic resonance. Crucially, we find that the sign of the reactance is directly governed by the spin transfer mechanism at the interface, which depends on the competition between its damping-like and field-like components parametrized by the spin mixing conductance. This characteristic behavior in the reactance offers a powerful transport observable in distinguishing the interfacial spin transfer processes in spintronic materials."

      "summary": "The injection, propagation and detection of spin currents are essential physical processes in spintronics. So far, the separation of charge and spin currents was facilitated by the electrical spin injection from a ferromagnet (FM) or the injection by a relativistic spin Hall effect. The devices employed are lateral spin valves comprising spatially separated injection and detection electrodes, connected by a spin-propagation channel. The time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking FM spin injection is realized in a geometry with an electrical bias applied between the injection electrode and the channel and is modelled by a conserved spin-polarized drift current. In contrast, the spin injection by the T-symmetric relativistic spin Hall mechanism is driven by an electrical bias applied across the injection electrode alone, and is modelled by a non-conserved spin current transverse to the applied bias. In this work, we use a lateral spin valve with a Mn5Si3 injection electrode to directly demonstrate a TRS-breaking spin injection from a compensated magnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Specifically, the TRS-breaking is demonstrated by the fact that switching between time-reversed states of the compensated magnet changes the detected spin signal. Moreover, the TRS-breaking nature of the spin injection is observed in both experimental geometries with the different electrical biasing, while using the same detection electrode. We show that this unconventional spin-injection is consistent with different magnitudes and propagation angles of electrical currents in the spin-up and spin-down channel in a d-wave altermagnet. Here our symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations are based on the compensated collinear altermagnetic order which has provided a comprehensive microscopic interpretation of earlier structural, magnetic, and anomalous Hall and Nernst measurements in Mn5Si3 thin films."

      "summary": "The emergence of a charge density wave (CDW) in a Weyl semimetal -- a correlated topological phase, is exceptionally rare in condensed matter systems. In this context, the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I undergoes a CDW transition at $T_{\\mathrm{CDW}} \\approx 263$~K, providing an exceptional platform to investigate correlated topological CDW states. Here, we uncover an additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \\sim 100$ K, well below the CDW onset, using low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, and thermoelectric measurements. This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($\\alpha$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified correlated phase transition in the topological CDW-Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, enriching the phase diagram of this material and establishing it as an ideal platform for studying intertwined electronic and structural orders."

We discover that the dynamical origin of MIPS is fundamentally altered by inertia, which induces a cooling mechanism absent in overdamped active matter. This conclusion is supported by an active variant of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method and by a kinetic theory for inertial self-propelled hard spheres derived from the microscopic dynamics. In contrast to the overdamped case, both analyses demonstrate that inertial MIPS does not rely on volume exclusion but on a cooling mechanism involving density, polarization, and temperature fields. This mechanism emerges from the competition between activity and a density dependent collision rate, arising from spatial correlations between colliding particles. These findings open a pathway to fundamentally connect inertial active matter with granular physics."

      "summary": "A full understanding of transport in dense, interacting suspensions requires analysis frameworks sensitive to self and collective dynamics across all relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here we introduce a trajectory-free approach to address this problem based on the power spectral density of particle number fluctuations (N-PSD). By combining colloidal experiments and theory we show that the N-PSD naturally probes behaviour across multiple important dynamic regimes and we fully uncover the mechanistic origins of characteristic spectral scalings and timescales. In particular, we demonstrate that while high-frequency scalings link to self-diffusion, low-frequency scalings sensitively capture long-lived correlations and collective dynamics. In this regime, interactions lead to non-trivial spectral signatures, governed by pairwise particle exchange at small length scales and collective rearrangements over large scales. Our findings thus provide important insight into the effect of interactions on microscopic dynamics and fluctuation phenomena and establish a powerful new tool with which to probe dynamics in complex systems."

      "summary": "Perovskite indoor photovoltaics (PIPVs) are emerging as a transformative technology for low-light intensity energy harvesting, owing to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), low-cost fabrication, solution-processability, and compositionally tunable band gaps. In this work, methylammonium-free perovskite absorbers were compositionally engineered to achieve band gaps of 1.55, 1.72, and 1.88 eV, enabling matching the spectral photoresponse with the indoor lighting. Devices based on a scalable mesoscopic n-i-p architecture were systematically evaluated under white LED illumination across correlated color temperatures (3000-5500 K) and light intensities from 250 to 1000 lux with active area of 1 cm2. The 1.72 eV composition exhibited the most promising performance across different light intensities and colors, achieving PCEs of 35.04 % at 1000 lux and 36.6 % at 250 lux, with a stable device operation of over 2000 hours. On the other hand, the 1.88 eV band-gap variant reached a peak PCE of 37.4 % under 250 lux (5500 K), however performance trade-offs were observed across the different color lights LEDs. Our combined experimental and theoretical optical-electrical simulations suggest that decreasing trap-assisted recombination in wide-bandgap compositions may further improve PIPV performance across the different illumination conditions. In contrast, devices with 1.55 eV band gap underperformed in such conditions due to suboptimal spectral overlap and utilization. These findings establish bandgap optimization and device architecture as key design principles for high-efficiency, stable PIPVs, advancing their integration into self-powered electronic systems and innovative indoor environments."

      "summary": "Controlled crystallization of amorphous alloys offers a powerful route to tailor magnetic and structural properties at the nanoscale. Thin films of CoFeB alloy are essential for the development of various spintronic devices. The crystallization mechanisms of CoFeB during the annealing process have been thoroughly investigated in earlier studies, demonstrating that boron diffuses from the amorphous film, allowing the remaining CoFe to form a body-centered cubic lattice. Here, a distinct transformation pathway in pulsed-laser-deposited amorphous Co40Fe40B20 films is revealed, where vacuum annealing drives the formation of a metastable tau-boride phase, (Co,Fe)23B6. Comprehensive structural characterization - combining X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and compositional analysis - proves that tau-boride forms with high crystalline quality and minimal boron loss. Following the transition from amorphous CoFeB films to crystalline (Co,Fe)23B6, an improvement of magnetic properties is observed, with corresponding increases in such values as saturation magnetization, coercivity, loop squareness, and average magnetic moment. The reproducible stabilization of a boron-rich metastable phase in CoFeB thin films expands the known crystallization landscape of this technologically important alloy system. These findings provide new insight into phase engineering in transition-metal borides and open opportunities for designing nanostructured magnetic materials with tunable functionality for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices."

Here we explore the situation of bosonic spin mixtures of erbium, adding the additional spin degree of freedom to the problem. We detect several inter- and intra-spin scattering resonances, exhibiting a peculiar asymmetric shape with a pronounced loss minimum. By developing a simplified multi-channel model we are able to recreate this characteristic behavior and to trace its origin to destructive interference between multiple pathways as predicted by Fano. We additionally observe a series of Fano-Feshbach resonances across multiple spin channels connected to the same molecular state, again confirmed by our theory. Our work opens the door for a detailed investigation to study multi-spin strongly-coupled scattering phenomena."

      "summary": "When the dimensions of structures shrink to the order of the inelastic mean free path of the energy-carrying quasi-particles, the character of energy transport changes from diffusive to ballistic. However, the point of transition remains a matter of debate. Here, we determine the dominant channel of energy transport through a nanoscale Cu layer as a function of its thickness. The energy rapidly transferred across Cu via hot electrons from a photo-excited Pt layer into a buried Ni detection layer translates into a rapid expansion of the Ni layer probed via ultrafast x-ray diffraction. The non-linear dependence of the Ni strain amplitude on the absorbed laser fluence indicates that the transport through Cu becomes more efficient with increasing fluence. This fluence-dependent transport efficiency is reproduced by a diffusive energy transport model and serves as a generally applicable experimental approach to distinguish diffusion from ballistic transport. Following this approach, we identify diffusive electronic energy transport to govern the spatial energy distribution for Cu layer thicknesses larger than twice the electronic inelastic mean free path."

Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework, we develop a transfer-matrix method to compute reflection and transmission coefficients for incident phonons and free particles. Our results reveal a scattering threshold at the Zeeman energy $E = \\hbar\\Omega_0$, separating a pure phonon regime from multi-channel scattering involving both collective and single-particle excitations above threshold. For large twist angles, competition between kinetic and Zeeman energies reduces the effective spin rotation, leading to comb-like density modulations and Fano-like resonances below threshold. The transition probability between phonon and particle channels is strongly tunable with $\\Theta$, enhanced for odd multiples of $\\pi$ but suppressed for even multiples. These findings establish twist-engineered domain walls as a versatile platform for controlling quantum transport, with implications for atomtronic devices and quantum simulation."

As a consequence, conflicting reports have emerged on both their electronic phase transitions and lattice dynamics. In this work, we perform a comparative study of the phononic and electronic Raman responses of high-quality ML-TL single crystals and contrast them with those of other RP nickelates, using samples with optimized oxygen content. We establish several Raman spectral features that enable unambiguous phase identification across the series. Moreover, we uncover characteristics in the phononic and electronic Raman response of ML-TL that are not reflected in the pure ML and TL compounds. We attribute these differences to a distinctive electronic structure arising from self-doping and confinement effects induced by the ML unit within the ML-TL lattice architecture."

Magnetic multipoles such as octupoles or triakontadipoles have been suggested as potential ferroic order parameters for d- and g-wave altermagnetism, respectively, based mainly on qualitative symmetry arguments. We use first-principles-based electronic structure calculations to establish a clear quantitative relation between the strength of the altermagnetic spin splitting and the magnitude of certain local multipoles. We vary the magnitude of these multipoles either by applying an appropriate constraint on the charge density or by varying a corresponding structural distortion mode, using two simple perovskite materials, SrCrO3 and LaVO3, as model systems. Our analysis indicates that in general the altermagnetic spin splitting is not exclusively determined by the lowest order nonzero magnetic multipole, but results from a superposition of contributions from different multipoles with comparable strength, suggesting the need for a multi-component order parameter to describe altermagnetism. We also discuss different measures to quantify the overall spin-splitting of a material, without relying on features that might be specific to only individual bands."

In this work, we systematically examine the CISS effect in such multichiral systems by designing a class of multilayer helical architectures constructed of stacked and interfaced individual helical rings, each possessing well-defined local chirality. Through controlled interlayer twisting, a global helical handedness is further imposed, forming a multichiral tubular helix. Theoretical calculations reveal that these two distinct chiral hierarchies lead to several unprecedented CISS phenomena, such as enhanced spin polarization arising from cooperative dual chirality, along with the simultaneous emergence of transverse and longitudinal CISS signals. Moreover, interlayer torsional competition modulates the system's response to external fields. The dual-chiral geometry breaks the conventional symmetry of single helices, inducing an anomalous angular phase shift in magnetoresistance. Furthermore, Floquet analysis reveals that the interplay between local and global chirality enables controlled spin polarization switching under circularly polarized light. These findings provide a basic theoretical framework for studying the CISS in multichiral superstructures and establish design principles for coupled optical, magnetic, and spin manipulations, thereby facilitating the development of multichiral spintronic devices."

      "summary": "The realization of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films raises a fundamental question: is the metallic ground state driven by lattice strain or interfacial charge reconstruction? Using fully self-consistent DFT+$U$ calculations on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures, we identify that intrinsic hole doping via interfacial Sr interdiffusion is the decisive factor in stabilizing the metallic state. Our 1-unit-cell model accurately reproduces the ARPES-observed Fermi surface, particularly the critical Ni-$d_{z^2}$ derived $\\gamma$ hole pocket, which originates exclusively from the interface-proximal bilayer. Furthermore, comparative tight-binding analysis suggests that the reduced superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in thin films stems from the synergistic suppression of the electronic density of states (DOS) and vertical superexchange coupling ($J \\perp Z$). These findings highlight that interface engineering plays a critical role beyond simple strain imposition in modulating nickelate orbital physics."

      "summary": "Ultrashort laser pulses provide the fastest known way to switch magnetic order. Such excitation commonly creates nanometer-scale domains, even after homogeneous illumination when the position of nucleated domains is not externally defined. However, the physics of domain localization during such ultrafast phase transitions remains unresolved. Here, we use shot-resolved pump-probe resonant x-ray scattering together with a material featuring a periodically modulated magnetic anisotropy landscape to track, in real time, the laser-driven nucleation and localization of nanometer-scale spin textures. We find that nucleation and localization are two distinct processes. Nucleation occurs homogeneously via fluctuations at early times, whereas spatially periodic structures emerge only later and, under suitable conditions, localize in less than one nanosecond. Real-space simulations show that this localization is governed by strong lateral variations in spin-texture lifetimes. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast phase-transition dynamics fundamentally differ from conventional transitions, yet still can be controlled through moderate nanometer-scale tailoring of the energy landscape."

      "summary": "Summarized abstract- Gallium nanoparticles (Ga-NPs) display tunable plasmonic resonances from the ultraviolet to the infrared, but achieving uniform and ordered Ga-NP arrays is hindered by coarsening-induced size dispersion during physical deposition. Here, the effect of substrate temperature on nucleation, growth, and homogenization of Ga-NPs thermally evaporated on GaAs is systematically analyzed using atomic force and scanning electron microscopies. An optimal 300-350 celsius degrees window yields narrowly dispersed, dense arrays, whereas higher temperatures enhance surface diffusion and desorption, producing larger, sparser, and morphologically relaxed (flattened) NPs. Temperature-dependent optical reflectance reveals localized surface plasmon resonances whose energies scale with NP size and aspect ratio, and a figure of merit combining density and size dispersion identifies intermediate temperatures as optimal, in agreement with increased plasmonic quality factors. In-situ post-deposition annealing demonstrates Ostwald ripening as the dominant high-temperature coarsening pathway and underscores the need for rapid cooling and oxide-shell stabilization to preserve homogeneity. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy confirm a core-shell architecture, quantify temperature-driven oxide thickening, and verify the liquid-metal nature of the Ga NPs core. Finally, extended deposition tests show that temperature-driven size homogenization persists for larger NPs, establishing a general framework for thermal control of uniformity and optical performance in Ga-NP arrays suitable for plasmonic devices."

The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$."

      "summary": "Symmetry and topology are essential principles in topological physics. Recently, the idea of sub-symmetry-protected topology -- where some of the original symmetries are broken while a remaining subset, called sub-symmetries, continues to protect specific boundary states -- has been developed. Here, we extend sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems from second-order topological insulators to semimetals. By introducing a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation that acts on a single sublattice and selectively preserves specific topological boundary states, we track the evolution of these states and their topological features using numerical and analytical methods, and we show that state-resolved quadrupole moments diagnose which corner or hinge modes remain topological. As a representative example of a second-order topological insulator, we begin with the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We demonstrate that, under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation, sub-symmetry-protected corner states remain pinned at zero energy and maintain quantized state-resolved quadrupole moments. In contrast, corner states on sub-symmetry-broken boundaries shift away from zero energy and lose their quantized character. We further extend this framework to a three-dimensional second-order topological semimetal, constructed by stacking second-order topological insulator layers, and analyze how second-order Fermi arc states -- hinge-localized modes that link the projections of bulk Dirac points, in contrast to conventional surface Fermi arcs -- evolve under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation. While one second-order Fermi arc becomes dispersive and loses its quadrupolar character under a sub-symmetry-breaking perturbation, the remaining second-order Fermi arcs retain chiral symmetry and preserve quantized quadrupolar characters."

      "summary": "The crystal structure of high-pressure solid hydrogen remains a fundamental open problem. Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications."

      "summary": "The $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ family of materials, where $Ln^{3+}$ is a lanthanide trivalent cation, have attracted extensive interest due to the interplay of electronic structure, magnetism, and topology present in this family that gives rise to complex electronic and magnetic phenomena. Specifically, the crystal field effects on the lanthanide ion and crystal field splitting of otherwise degenerate energy levels causes dramatic changes in the orbital magnetic behavior and overall magnetic structure of these materials. The coupling of the highly anisotropic lanthanide ions' spins (with large spin-orbit couplings) to the spins of the Mn atoms, which are arrayed in a kagome lattice, engenders exotic topological phenomena. This combination of magnetic anisotropy and electronic topology motivates investigation into the magnetic excitations of these materials, which unlike the ground state magnetic structures of this family, have not been extensively studied. Herein, we use Brillouin light scattering to measure the magnon spectra of $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, and Ho). This work represents the first detailed and comparative study on the magnetic dynamics in these materials and reveals that the identity of the lanthanide ion strongly influences the magnon frequency and demonstrates a direct correlation between the lanthanide's magnetic anisotropy and the observed spin wave excitations. Quantitative analysis indicates that the lanthanide ion's anisotropy controls the magnon frequency, while its total angular momentum influences the material's gyromagnetic ratio. These findings suggest that lanthanide substitution provides a pathway for tuning magnon properties in this material family."

To this aim, we first derive in a structured and consistent way the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism at the CDMFT level in all physical channels, explicitly addressing the important aspect of the related Ward identities. In this context, we perform systematic calculations of the BSE for the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling at intermediate coupling. Our study illustrates how the divergence of a fundamental building block of the BSE in the charge channel, the two-particle irreducible vertex, systematically occurs at lower interactions than in the (purely local) DMFT case, due to short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Further, the change of sign of the eigenvalues of the generalized charge susceptibility associated to the vertex divergences is identified as the essential prerequisite to drive, at larger interaction values, the physics of the Mott transition in two dimensions, as well as of the adjacent phase-separation instabilities."

Due to its widespread use and poor biodegradability, Pd2+ accumulates in environmental ecosystems, posing severe risks to both the environment and living organisms. Consequently, there is a strong demand for selective, sensitive, and user-friendly detection methods. Among emerging strategies, optical detection techniques (both luminescent and colorimetric) using metal-based receptors have gained considerable attention. These sensors offer distinct advantages over traditional organic probes, including large Stokes shifts, long emission lifetimes, exceptional photostability, enhanced water solubility, recyclability, and remarkable chemical versatility. These attributes make them highly suitable for diverse applications in sensing and bioanalytical fields. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in luminescent and colorimetric metal-based probes, including metal complexes and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), for the selective detection of Pd2+. It discusses key design strategies, critical performance factors, and future prospects, offering valuable insights for researchers working on next-generation sensing platform."

Here we present a theoretical demonstration that a topological $d+id$ fractionalized superconducting phase (SC*) can emerge in the weak-coupling limit of a Kondo lattice model, where conduction electrons interact with a Yao-Lee spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice (the Yao-Lee-Kondo model). Using a renormalization-group analysis, we show that exchanging Majorana spinons from the Yao-Lee spin liquid generates effective interactions among the conduction electrons and drives a Cooper instability even for arbitrarily weak Kondo coupling. We further find that the induced leading inter-orbital antiferromagnetic interaction selects topological $d+id$ spin-singlet pairing with Chern number $C=\\pm 2$. Meanwhile, the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee spin liquid remain gapless and deconfined in this regime, so the resulting state is a fractionalized topological $d+id$ superconductor (SC*). For sufficiently strong Kondo coupling, the system instead enters a heavy Fermi liquid phase with fractionalization (HFL*)."

We systematically investigated the effects of phase evolution, structural modulation, and morphology on the oxidase activity of MnO$_x$ with Fe substitution. The oxidase-like activity was evaluated using the chromogenic substrate 3,3$'$,5,5$'$-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which produced a blue-colored oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) with an absorption peak at 652~nm upon oxidation. While all Fe-doped MnO$_x$ nanostructures exhibited oxidase-like activity, the 10\\% Fe-doped sample (10Fe-MnO$_x$) demonstrated the highest performance, likely due to a synergistic effect of structure, morphology, and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The underlying oxidase mechanism was investigated using steady-state kinetics and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. In addition, a colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of Hg$^{2+}$ and hydroquinone (HQ) in real water samples collected from industrial and natural sources. The calculated detection limits of the 10Fe-MnO$_x$ colorimetric probe for HQ (1.74~$\\mu$M) and Hg$^{2+}$ (0.47~$\\mu$M) outperformed those of conventional metal oxide-based nanozymes.

      "summary": "Donor-$\\pi$-acceptor (D-$\\pi$-A) functionalization of MOF linkers can enhance visible-light photocatalytic activity, yet the mechanisms responsible for these effects remain unclear. Here we combine EPR spectroscopy, transient photoluminescence, and first-principles calculations to examine how diazo-coupled anisole, diphenylamine (DPA), and N,N-dimethylaniline (NNDMA) groups modify the photophysics of UiO-66-NH$_2$. All donor units introduce new occupied states near the valence-band edge, enabling charge separation through dye-to-framework electron transfer. Among them, the anisole-modified material stands out for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing into a triplet charge-transfer configuration that suppresses fast recombination and yields long-lived charge carriers detectable by photo-EPR. Meanwhile, bulkier donors such as DPA and NNDMA - despite their stronger electron-donating character - also tend to introduce defect-associated trap states. These results underscore the interplay between donor-induced electronic-structure changes, triplet pathways, and defect-mediated recombination, offering a mechanistic basis for tuning photocatalytic response in D-$\\pi$-A-modified MOFs."

      "summary": "Temperature-dependent transport data, including diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivities, are routinely analysed by fitting empirical models such as the Arrhenius equation. These fitted models yield parameters such as the activation energy, and can be used to extrapolate to temperatures outside the measured range. Researchers frequently face challenges in this analysis: quantifying the uncertainty of fitted parameters, assessing whether the data quality is sufficient to support a particular empirical model, and using these models to predict behaviour at extrapolated temperatures. Bayesian methods offer a coherent framework that addresses all of these challenges. This tutorial introduces the use of Bayesian methods for analysing temperature-dependent transport data, covering parameter estimation, model selection, and extrapolation with uncertainty propagation, with illustrative examples from molecular dynamics simulations of superionic materials."

      "summary": "In the local-moment regime, heavy fermions are most economically described by a compact U(1) gauge theory. With this formulation of the Kondo lattice, we study a spin chain coupled to two-dimensional Dirac conduction electrons. The spin chain is described by fermionic partons carrying spin and U(1) gauge charge. The heavy-fermion quasiparticle is a bound state of a U(1) matter field carrying unit electric and U(1) gauge charge, and the fermionic parton. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify two symmetry-equivalent regimes: a heavy-fermion metal with a sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust low-frequency transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with an incoherent resonance and vanishing low-frequency transport. For any finite lattice extent in the direction perpendicular to the chain, the Luttinger volume of the heavy-fermion phase counts both composite and conduction electrons, while in the Kondo-breakdown phase it counts only the conduction electrons. The evolution of the composite-fermion spectrum, dynamical spin structure factor, and optical conductivity provides a nonperturbative demonstration of gauge-mediated Kondo breakdown and establishes transport fingerprints of an orbital-selective Mott transition in the context of U(1) gauge theories of heavy fermions."

Although most theoretical and experimental studies have relied on real-space observables, the frequency-dependent nature of the Hawking process motivates a momentum-space analysis to access its spectral structure and entanglement features. Here, we numerically compute the momentum-space two-point correlation function in a quantum fluid using the truncated Wigner approximation, a general method applicable to both conservative and driven-dissipative systems. We consider a polaritonic fluid of light in a realistic configuration known to yield strong real-space correlations between Hawking, partner, and witness modes. We find signatures that are directly accessible in state-of-the-art experiments and offer a robust diagnostic of spontaneous emission. Our results form the basis for a new theoretical framework to assess a variety of effects, such as quasi-normal mode emission or modifications of the horizon structure on the Hawking spectrum."

      "summary": "Local rearrangements are the elements of plastic deformation in an amorphous solid. In oscillatory shear, they can switch reversibly between two distinct configurations. While these repeating relaxations are typically considered in the limit of slow driving, their dynamics is less well understood. We perform experiments on a colloidal amorphous solid at an oil-water interface. The rearrangement timescales we observe span at least 1 decade, with no apparent upper bound. As frequency is increased, individual rearrangements appear faster and more hysteretic, but may disappear entirely above a crossover frequency -- suggesting that in practical experiments, the slowest rearrangements may be latent. We show how to find the effective potential energy that reproduces a particle's frequency-dependent motion. In rare cases, this potential energy has only one minimum. Our results have implications for the energy landscapes and rheology of amorphous or glassy solids, for sound propagation in nonlinear media, and for mechanical memory and history-dependence."

Particles interact via an Ising Hamiltonian and phase separation occurs at low temperature. We drive the system out of equilibrium by imposing a temperature field that varies spatially on macroscopic scales while preserving local equilibrium. Under these conditions, the usual low-temperature long-range order is replaced by robust convection patterns, featuring regularly spaced stripe structures for suitable geometries. These nonequilibrium states differ markedly from those obtained in an equilibrium dynamics with the same local temperature profile. We develop a macroscopic description that captures these behaviors and provides a unified framework for understanding the observed patterns."

Recent advances in controlling light-matter systems have opened new avenues to explore non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions. In this work, we perform a parametric study of these effects in a polariton system, i.e., a light-matter superposition, under both dissipative and coherent coupling. We characterize the effects of different sources of non-Hermitian behavior and analytically identify the conditions for the emergence of negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum as a function of the light-matter detuning, the coherent-to-dissipative coupling ratio, and the relative decay rate of the non-interacting subsystems. We also analyze the classical limit of the polariton system within a non-Hermitian framework, employing coherent states."

The protocols are implemented experimentally for cold atoms subjected to inertial and magnetic forces, demonstrating high sensitivity and robustness. Our approach establishes a general route to time-optimal quantum sensing beyond standard interferometric architectures, applcable across all quantum platforms."

EBSD is a major technique for characterizing these microstructures, but acquiring large and statistically representative EBSD maps remains slow, costly, and often limited to small regions. In this work, we introduce InfinityEBSD, a diffusion-based method for generating monophase realistic EBSD maps of arbitrary size, conditioned on physically meaningful microstructural metrics. This approach supports two primary use cases: extending small experimental EBSD maps to arbitrary sizes, and generating entirely new maps directly from statistical descriptors, without any input map. Conditioning is achieved through eight microstructural descriptors, including grain size, grain perimeter, grain inertia ratio, coordination number and disorientation angle distribution, allowing the model to generate maps that are both visually realistic and physically interpretable. A patch-wise geometric extension strategy ensures spatial continuity across grains, enabling the model to produce large-scale EBSD maps while maintaining coherent grain boundaries and orientation transitions. The generated maps can also be exported as valid Channel Text Files (CTF) for immediate post-processing and analysis in software such as MTEX or simulation environments like DIGIMU. We quantitatively validate our results by comparing distributions of the guiding metrics before and after generation, showing that the model respects the statistical targets while introducing morphological diversity. InfinityEBSD demonstrates that diffusion models, guided by physical metrics, can bridge the gap between synthetic and realistic materials representation, paving the way for future developments such as 3D realistic microstructure generation from 2D data."

These remarkable properties rely on the stability of the SAF skyrmion's topological bound state, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using an atomistic spin model, we analyze the collapse pathways of bilayer SAF skyrmions in homochiral systems, where both ferromagnetic layers share the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors, and in heterochiral systems, where the DMI vectors have opposite directions. We find that pair destruction occurs either by decoupling or by sequential collapse into the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state, so the activation energy is set by the smaller of these two barriers. By examining how these barriers vary with DMI strength, anisotropy, magnetic field, and interlayer exchange, we identify regimes of enhanced stability. In particular, increasing interlayer coupling strengthens homochiral skyrmions but weakens heterochiral ones, while reducing the anisotropy constant effectively stabilizes heterochiral SAF skyrmions. These results outline viable strategies to optimize SAF heterostructures for enhanced skyrmion stability in racetrack devices and emerging active skyrmionic systems."

Theoretical models of polarons have only recently been extended to the excited state. Experimental measurements of polaron formation and transport have been widely undertaken across a range of materials, from photocatalysts and superconductors to soft conducting polymers. Here, we map experimental measurements of quantities such as polaron strength onto phase diagrams of the Holstein, Hubbard-Holstein, and t-J-Holstein models. This work demonstrates that tuning electron-phonon coupling strength, electron localization, and spin exchange can be leveraged to suppress or control polaron formation in transition metal oxides. We find that the t-J-Holstein model best describes the measured iron oxides and could be generally applied to a wide range of systems that exhibit polaron formation in the excited state. This work combines experimental data with ground state models to provide a robust parameter space for informing photoexcited polaron design."

Copper and silicon oxide are selected as reference materials due to their properties as excellent and poor heat conductors, respectively. The model integrates well-known heat transfer mechanisms, allowing for the assessment of the effects of these distinct heater materials. The results show that materials with superior thermal diffusivity, such as copper, significantly enhance cooling efficiency during nucleate boiling. Moreover, the study provides insights into the relationship between bubble growth, microlayer recovery beneath a bubble, temperature fluctuations, and heater properties. Comparisons between copper and silicon oxide underscore variations in bubble frequency, attributed to differences in bubble growth time, microlayer recovery time, and material-dependent behavior. The influence of neighboring boiling sites is especially pronounced in silicon oxide due to its low thermal conductivity and diffusivity values. Temperature variations in this material become highly visible due to its very slow response to temperature changes. Simulation results align well with semi-empirical correlations, confirming the model's success in capturing the intricate phenomena of nucleate pool boiling. In summary, the model reveals that changes in the thermal properties of the heater affect not only boiling performance but also key characteristics of the process, including bubble frequency, boiling patterns, regularity, and cavity reactivation speed."

In addition to the previously observed exciton-Umklapp feature, the theory reproduces and explains the higher-band attractive-polaron resonances recently reported experimentally. Our model further uncovers that the appearance of two equal-strength and parallel attractive polarons, as commonly observed in WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, is a signature of strong correlations in the electronic system. Altogether, our results demonstrate that accounting for electronic interactions is essential to reproduce and interpret the exciton-polaron spectra of TMDs."

Yet, while the relation between entanglement and topology is well established, little is known about the role of nonstabilizerness (or magic), a pivotal concept in fault-tolerant quantum computation, in topological phases. We introduce the concept of topological magic response, the ability of a state to spread over stabilizer space when perturbed by finite-depth non-Clifford circuits. Unlike a topological invariant or order parameter, this response function probes how a phase reacts to non-Clifford perturbations, revealing the presence of non-local quantum correlations. In Ising-type spin chains, we show that symmetry-broken and paramagnetic phases lack such a response, whereas symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases always display it. To capture this, we utilize a combination of stabilizer R\\'{e}nyi entropies that, in analogy with topological entanglement entropy, isolates non-locally stored information. Using exact analytic computations and matrix product states simulations based on an algorithmic technique we introduce, we show that SPT phases doped with $T$ gates support robust topological magic response, while trivial phases remain featureless."

      "summary": "We evaluate the Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) algorithm on one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg models, including strongly correlated regimes in which the ground state is dense. Using problem-informed initial states and magnetization-sector sweeps, SKQD accurately reproduces ground-state energies and field-dependent magnetization across a range of anisotropies. Benchmarks against DMRG and exact diagonalization show consistent qualitative agreement, with accuracy improving systematically in more anisotropic regimes. We further demonstrate SKQD on quantum hardware by implementing 18- and 30-qubit Heisenberg chains, obtaining magnetization curves that match theoretical expectations. Simulations on small 2D square-lattice systems further demonstrate that the method applies effectively beyond 1D geometries."

      "summary": "Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains one of the grand challenges of modern physics. In particular, increasing attention has been devoted to the emergence of non-equilibrium universality classes that have no equilibrium counterparts. A prominent example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class realized in dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates. In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case. Our results reveal the intricate interplay between kinetic constraints and dissipation in quantum many-body systems."

The continuum nature of the $\\phi^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $\\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as the market kurtosis, which can serve as an indicator of possible market shocks. Accurate reproduction of high kurtosis is absent in binarized models. Therefore Ising models, despite being widely employed in econophysics, are incapable of fully representing empirical financial data, a limitation not present in the generalization of the $\\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory. We then investigate the scaling properties of the $\\phi^{4}$ machine learning algorithm and extract exponents which govern the behavior of the learned couplings (or weights and biases in ML language) in relation to the number of stocks in the model. Finally, we use our model to forecast the price changes of the AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA stocks. We conclude by discussing how the $\\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory could be used to build investment strategies and the possible intuitions that the QFT operations of dimensional compactification and renormalization can provide for financial modelling."

While this bistable behavior has been already observed in the past, the characterization of the statistical properties of avalanche activity and their temporal organization is still lacking, as well as a model able to reproduce these dynamics. Here, we analyze experimental data of human neuronal cultures with controlled percentage of inhibitory neurons and characterize their statistical properties and dynamical organization. In order to model the experimental data, we propose a novel version of the Kuramoto model for two populations of oscillators, excitatory and inhibitory, implementing successfully the inhibition dynamics. The model can fully reproduce the experimental results, confirming the existence of correlations in the temporal organization of avalanche activity and the presence of an amplification - attenuation regime, as found in the human brain."

      "summary": "We consider sparse signal reconstruction via minimization of the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty, and develop one-step replica-symmetry-breaking (1RSB) extensions of approximate message passing (AMP), termed 1RSB-AMP. Starting from the 1RSB formulation of belief propagation, we derive explicit update rules of 1RSB-AMP together with the corresponding state evolution (1RSB-SE) equations. A detailed comparison shows that 1RSB-AMP and 1RSB-SE agree remarkably well at the macroscopic level, even in parameter regions where replica-symmetric (RS) AMP, termed RS-AMP, diverges and where the 1RSB description itself is not expected to be thermodynamically exact. Fixed-point analysis of 1RSB-SE reveals a phase diagram consisting of success, failure, and diverging phases, as in the RS case. However, the diverging-region boundary now depends on the Parisi parameter due to the 1RSB ansatz, and we propose a new criterion -- minimizing the size of the diverging region -- rather than the conventional zero-complexity condition, to determine its value. Combining this criterion with the nonconvexity-control (NCC) protocol proposed in a previous RS study improves the algorithmic limit of perfect reconstruction compared with RS-AMP. Numerical solutions of 1RSB-SE and experiments with 1RSB-AMP confirm that this improved limit is achieved in practice, though the gain is modest and remains slightly inferior to the Bayes-optimal threshold. We also report the behavior of thermodynamic quantities -- overlaps, free entropy, complexity, and the non-self-averaging susceptibility -- that characterize the 1RSB phase in this problem."

      "summary": "Time-dependent deformation, particularly creep, in high-temperature alloys such as Inconel 625 is a key factor in the long-term reliability of components used in aerospace and energy systems. Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds. The proposed framework enables rapid creep assessment for design optimization and structural health monitoring, and provides a scalable solution for high-temperature alloy applications."

Using multiple-scale analysis, we show that families of nonlinear skin breathing modes -- time-periodic, boundary-localized oscillations -- emerge from their linear counterparts at any nonreciprocal strength. We derive an explicit nonlinear frequency shift for these families of nonlinear breathing modes, showing its dependence on amplitude, nonlinearity type, lattice size, and nonreciprocity, and we predict the emergence of genuine skin end breathers at the boundary once their oscillation frequency and higher harmonics enter the spectral gaps of the linear spectrum. Numerical pseudo-arclength continuation confirms full families of solutions for both hardening and softening nonlinearities. Furthermore, the Floquet analysis shows that these modes can be either linearly stable or unstable, with Floquet eigenvectors exhibiting skin localization inherited from the asymmetric couplings. Our results extend the nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect from stationary modes to intrinsically time-periodic excitations, providing a pathway to engineer and control breathing modes in nonreciprocal mechanical metamaterials."

We generate continuous variable microwave states with a squeezing of up to 5dB below the vacuum level and let this signal interrogate a spin ensemble, which is inductively coupled to a lumped element superconducting microwave resonator with a cooperativity of C=0.3. Analyzing this signal using Wigner tomography, we observe a transfer efficiency of around 61% between the squeezed microwaves and the spin excitation. We successfully model our experimental results with a dedicated steady-state model based on the quantum input-output formalism and provide guidance for design parameters required to enable spin-based quantum memories."

This study examines discrete spherical Halbach configurations assembled from permanent magnets placed at the vertices of Platonic and Archimedean solids. Analytical calculations, numerical field simulations, and experimental measurements indicate that polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry achieve the most favorable balance among field strength, homogeneity, and interior accessibility. They produce exceptionally flat fourth-order central saddle points, resulting in a usable homogeneous field volume up to a factor of 260 larger than that of traditional Halbach disk or cylindrical arrays. Several magnet assemblies composed of cubical NdFeB magnets are fabricated and their three dimensional field distributions characterized, demonstrating homogeneous regions of up to several cubic centimeters with deviations below 1%. The findings establish discrete icosahedrally symmetric magnet arrays as practical, scalable building blocks for compact, highly homogeneous magnetic field sources suited to mobile magnetic resonance, and magnetophoretic applications."

By shunting one end of the transmission line by a nonlinear Josephson element, we show how a cooling mechanism can be engineered that transfers photons from high- into low-frequency modes, while preserving their total number. We evaluate the resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the photon gas, which arises from a competition between this engineered cooling process and the natural, number non-conserving thermalization with the surrounding bath. Our analysis predicts that for realistic experimental parameters, this mechanism can be used to prepare photonic gases at sub-millikelvin temperatures, considerably below the typical base temperature of a dilution refrigerator. In addition, the system exhibits a new type of condensation transition that does not occur in the corresponding equilibrium scenario. As an outlook, we discuss potential applications of this cooling approach for quantum simulation schemes with interacting microwave photons."

      "summary": "Controlling light emission at the nanoscale has important applications in solid-state lighting, displays, and quantum light sources. Achieving this control requires both enhanced local electromagnetic fields to boost emission intensity and engineered radiation patterns to direct photons efficiently. Mie voids, consisting of an air cavity surrounded by a high-index semiconductor, are particularly suited for this purpose because they expose their strongest fields in an accessible region for nearby emitters while supporting resonances that shape directional emission through interference. Here, we demonstrate an all-van der Waals nanophotonic platform that couples excitons in atomically thin WS$_2$ to Mie void resonators formed in WSe$_2$. Guided by electromagnetic simulations, we identify void geometries that maximize photoluminescence through synergistic enhancement of excitation and emission processes. We also develop a two-step fabrication strategy that enables independent control of void diameter and depth, providing a route to systematically tune the optical response. Experimentally, we observe up to a 600-fold increase in photoluminescence intensity from monolayer WS$_2$ placed on individual voids compared to on an unstructured WSe$_2$, along with pronounced out-of-plane beaming of light that yields a forward-to-off-axis enhancement of 2.6 dB. Our results establish Mie voids in van der Waals semiconductors as a new platform for controlling light-matter interactions and realizing compact, directional, and efficient nanoscale light sources."

      "summary": "ATPases cyclically convert chemical energy in the form of ATP gradients into directed motion inside cells. To function, ATPases rely on allosteric communication between at least two binding sites, an internal signaling mechanism that is not well understood. Here, we model an ATPase-like machine by using a system of mechanical linkages to recreate negative allosteric coupling between two binding sites and generate cycles in which the sites alternate occupancy. The ATPase analog has two mechanical degrees of freedom and two discretized binding sites: one for the ATP, Pi and ADP analogs, and one for an allosteric effector analog. The geometry of the ATPase analog allows stepwise binding reactions at each site to capture the two degrees of freedom in a mutually exclusive way. Consequently, the enzyme interconverts between multiple rigid and partially rigid forms, such that neither site can be fully bound when both sites are occupied. Two mechanisms work together to generate an enzymatic cycle: one, in which the tighter-binding ATP analog can bind and displace the effector from the enzyme; and a second, in which flexibility introduced by splitting the ATP analog into two pieces (catalysis) allows the effector to rebind and displace the products (ADP analog). We show that cleavage (forward catalysis) and ligation (reverse catalysis) alter the rigidity of the enzyme complex equivalently to binding and dissociation, respectively, but must do so more slowly for effective cycling to take place. Simple designs for synthetic systems that mimic ATPase monomers can be derived from this work."

      "summary": "Designing molecules that must satisfy multiple, often conflicting objectives is a central challenge in molecular discovery. The enormous size of chemical space and the cost of high-fidelity simulations have driven the development of machine learning-guided strategies for accelerating design with limited data. Among these, Bayesian optimization (BO) offers a principled framework for sample-efficient search, while generative models provide a mechanism to propose novel, diverse candidates beyond fixed libraries. However, existing methods that couple the two often rely on continuous latent spaces, which introduces both architectural entanglement and scalability challenges. This work introduces an alternative, modular \"generate-then-optimize\" framework for de novo multi-objective molecular design/discovery. At each iteration, a generative model is used to construct a large, diverse pool of candidate molecules, after which a novel acquisition function, qPMHI (multi-point Probability of Maximum Hypervolume Improvement), is used to optimally select a batch of candidates most likely to induce the largest Pareto front expansion. The key insight is that qPMHI decomposes additively, enabling exact, scalable batch selection via only simple ranking of probabilities that can be easily estimated with Monte Carlo sampling. We benchmark the framework against state-of-the-art latent-space and discrete molecular optimization methods, demonstrating significant improvements across synthetic benchmarks and application-driven tasks. Specifically, in a case study related to sustainable energy storage, we show that our approach quickly uncovers novel, diverse, and high-performing organic (quinone-based) cathode materials for aqueous redox flow battery applications."

The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom."

      "summary": "We study opinion formation in a society where agents interact on a modular network generated using a stochastic block model (SBM). Opinion dynamics is modeled through the Biswas-Chatterjee-Sen (BChS) kinetic exchange model, in which agents undergo pairwise interactions that could be positive or negative. By tuning the relative strength of intra- and inter-group connectivity inherent to the SBM, as well as the disagreement probability, we identify distinct collective phases. In particular, we observe a robust regime with strong intragroup ordering but no global consensus, in addition to fully ordered and disordered states. These results demonstrate how modular interaction structure can qualitatively alter collective opinion dynamics and hinder consensus formation."

However, the compatibility of such heterostructures with high-quality-factor microwave superconducting cavities remains a challenge due to defects in the material stack. In this work, we present an approach to enhance the coherence of cavity modes on a reverse-graded Ge/SiGe heterostructure, which consists of etching the full $\\sim 1.6~\\mathrm{\\mu m}$-thick Ge/SiGe stack down to its starting high-resistivity Si substrate, in order to pattern superconducting cavities directly on it. We engineer the mesa step to be tapered, so that it can be easily climbed by the superconducting cavities to reach the quantum devices potentially hosted in the Ge quantum well. Using this approach, we observe internal quality factors of $Q_\\mathrm{i} \\approx 10000-20000$ for high-impedance frequency-tunable Josephson junction array resonators, limited by the junctions' fabrication, and $Q_\\mathrm{i} \\approx 100000$ for $50~\\mathrm{\\Omega}$ coplanar waveguide Nb lift-off resonators. These $Q_\\mathrm{i}$ are preserved despite the overlap with the mesa structure in the climbing region, and are comparable to the ones obtained for identical resonators fabricated on a high-resistivity Si wafer reference. Thereby, this work paves a practical path toward superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, immediately applicable to emerging technologies on planar Ge."

We introduce a cavity QED quantum simulator that engineers competing chiral $p_x+ip_y$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ orders by tailoring cavity-mediated couplings between atomic pseudospins that emulate momentum-dependent pairing channels. The desired spatially inhomogeneous cavity-mediated couplings can be engineered in a 2D optical lattice using incommensurate cavity-lattice wavelengths naturally occurring in cavity QED systems. This minimal and fully tunable platform enables controlled state preparation and continuous measurement of superconducting order parameters, revealing phases in both equilibrium and sudden-quench settings with a single dominant pairing channel, as well as coexistence regimes with competing pairing channels. Crucially, our implementation allows direct observation of topological transitions in and out of equilibrium, providing a powerful route to the quantum simulation of competing topological superconducting phases that remain elusive in solid-state and ultracold-atom systems."

The indication from recent experiments is that the charge equilibration length is much shorter than the thermal equilibration length. We discuss how this discovery gives rise to different thermal equilibration regimes in the presence of full charge equilibration. In this work, we classify these distinct regimes via dc current-current correlations (electrical shot noise) at definite experimentally found (or possible) QPC conductance plateaus for the edges of integer, particle-like, and hole-like filling fractions in a two dimensional electron gas. Our analyses show that distinct universal features arise among the different thermal equilibration regimes for the edges of particle-like and hole-like states."

      "summary": "The electronic properties of solids are determined by the crystal structure and interactions between electrons, giving rise to a variety of collective phenomena including superconductivity, strange metals and correlated insulators. The mechanisms underpinning many of these collective phenomena remain unknown, driving interest in creating artificial crystals which replicate the system of interest while allowing precise control of key parameters. Here we demonstrate the formation of highly tunable artificial crystals by superimposing a periodic electrostatic potential on the 2D electron gas in an ultra-shallow (25 nm deep) GaAs quantum well. The 100 nm period artificial crystal is identified by the formation of a new bandstructure, different from the original cubic crystal and specific to the artificial triangular lattice: transport measurements show the Hall coefficient changing sign as the chemical potential sweeps through the artificial bands. Uniquely, the artificial bandstructure can be continuously tuned to form linear graphene-like and flat kagome-like bands in a single device. A strong insulating state is observed at half filling of the kagome flat band, which is not expected in the absence of strong interactions. This state, unique to the kagome lattice, is consistent with a loop-current Wigner insulator, which arises from long-range Coulomb interaction and delocalised electrons between neighbouring empty sites. The ability to continuously tune the bandstructure and access flat bands through electrical gating within a single device opens a new route to studying collective quantum states."

We suspend our polydisperse particles in a density matched solvent, and let the particles spontaneously aggregate through the van der Waals force. The particle size distribution $P(R)$ is roughly log-normal, with the largest particles more than 15 times the size of the smallest particles. The pairing of nearest neighbor particles is consistent with a null hypothesis that pairings are made randomly, that is, any two particle sizes have a probability of being neighbors consistent with their proportionality in $P(R)$. That being said, as expected, larger particles have more nearest neighbors than small ones. This leads to an over-representation of large particles in tetrahedral structures where four particles are mutually nearest neighbors, showing that large particles help provide rigidity to the gel structure. The tetrahedral structures also suggest that particles are able to rearrange during the gelation process, until their motion is stabilized by the multiple contacts with their neighbors. We discuss the implications of how other size distributions $P(R)$ would affect the gel structure."

The results reveal that topological re-entrant phase transition emerges. Through the analysis of a real-space winding number , we divide the emergent topological re-entrant phase transitions into two types. The first is the re-entrant phase transition from the traditional topological insulator phase into the topological Anderson insulator phase, and the second is the re-entrant phenomenon from one topological Anderson insulator phase into another topological Anderson insulator phase. These two types of re-entrant phase transition correspond to bounded and unbounded cases of quasiperiodic modulation, respectively. Furthermore, we verify the above topological re-entrant phase transitions by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent and bulk gap. Since Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models have been realized in various artificial systems (such as cold atoms, optical waveguide arrays, ion traps, Rydberg atom arrays, etc.), the two types of topological re-entrant phase transition predicted in this paper are expected to be realized in the near future."

As an important consequence, we find that the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the planar magnon thermal Hall effect without the DM interaction. This removes the local inversion-symmetry-breaking condition for generating the magnon thermal Hall effect. Moreover, we predict an exotic phenomenon that the thermal conductivity exhibits angular dependence with respect to the in-plane magnetization. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions."

Using graphene as a case study, we decompose the dynamical matrix into distinct terms that exhibit different dependencies on the electron energy and wavefunction. We then examine the role of quantum geometry in shaping the material's phonon spectrum, and we find that removing the nontrivial quantum geometric contribution from the dynamical matrix causes the acoustic phonon modes to behave in a non-analytic fashion."

More recently, a second interference feature -- the Coherent Forward Scattering (CFS) peak -- was predicted to emerge in the regime of strong localization. However, it has never been directly observed. Here we report the first direct observation of the CFS peak and demonstrate its dual role as a signature of non-ergodicity and as a probe of symmetries in quantum chaotic systems. Using a shaken rotor model realized with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms in a modulated optical lattice, we investigate dynamical localization in momentum space. The CFS peak emerges in the position distribution as a consequence of non-ergodic dynamics, while its growth timescale reveals the underlying localization length. By finely tuning the modulation, we control time-reversal and parity symmetries and measure their distinct effects on both CBS and CFS peaks. Our results highlight the strong link of both the temporal growth and contrast of the CFS with symmetry and localization, making it a robust probe of these properties. This work opens new directions for characterizing non-ergodicity and symmetries in quantum chaotic or disordered systems, with possible applications in many-body localization and chaos."

While pronounced dispersion anomalies were reported in several phonon branches, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under low temperature and high magnetic field, we uncover a striking phonon renormalization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting the wave vectors of a short-range 2D-CDW, emerging above the superconducting transition, and a long-range 3D-CDW, appearing only when superconductivity is strongly suppressed. The spectral changes are strongest around the wave vector of the 3D-CDW despite the fact that it is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models, instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive CDW excitations and provide insights into the interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors."

      "summary": "Bi2O2Se belongs to a group of quasi-2D semiconductors that can replace silicon in future high-speed/low-power electronics. However, the correlation between crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes understanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier concentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks explanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about 150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high permittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and Raman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined mosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons allowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries determined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the tetragonal plane is as high as ${\\epsilon}_r{\\approx}500$, and this high value is due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz). Such an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects, leading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It also allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high performance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very low frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency phonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional temperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\\approx}T^{3.5}$. The temperature-dependent, two-component group velocity is proposed to explains the unusual temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, ${\\kappa}{\\approx}T^{1.5}$"

Using ab initio methods, we explore spin-orbit coupling-induced gapped states and identify multiple Weyl-like crossings around the Fermi energy, confirming a Chern number $|C| = 1$ and a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of 257 $\\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$.

As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation"

      "summary": "Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices, where the first magnon gaps are topologically trivial and do not support topological edge states (TESs). In this context, antiferromagnetic (AFM) SkXs on the triangular spin lattice have been considered potentially more interesting for applications, since TESs emerge in the first magnon gap. Meanwhile, the magnon topology of SkXs on non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the magnon band structure and TESs in 2D FM SkXs stabilized on the honeycomb spin lattice, including experimentally motivated parameter sets relevant to van der Waals magnets. We show that TESs emerge in the first magnon gap over significant ranges of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Field-induced topological phase transitions modify the number of these TESs before eventually trivializing them, thereby enabling controlled switching of magnonic edge transport. These findings highlight the role of lattice geometry in shaping the magnon topology of noncollinear spin textures."

      "summary": "While a spin-dependent band splitting is one of the characteristic features of altermagnets, the conventional band picture itself breaks down in the many altermagnets that are correlated Mott materials. We employ two numerical many-body methods, the self-consistent Born approximation and variational cluster approach, to explore this strongly correlated regime and investigate hole motion in Mott altermagnets. Our results reveal that spin-dependent spectral-weight transfer is the dominant signature of Mott altermagnetism. This pronounced spin-momentum locking of the quasiparticle spectral weight arises from the formation of altermagnetic polarons, whose dynamics are governed by the interplay between free hole motion and the coupling of the hole to magnon excitations in the altermagnet. We demonstrate this effect by calculating ARPES spectra for three canonical altermagnetic systems: the checkerboard $J$-$J'$ model, a variant describing the transition-metal--ion sites of the inverse Lieb lattice, and the Kugel-Khomskii spin-orbital altermagnet based on cubic vanadates RVO$_3$ (R=La, Pr, Nd, Y)."

These identities link the fluctuations of state or current observables to a combination of responses of these observables to perturbations of transition rates. Here, we complement these results by deriving analogous FRRs applicable to mixed covariances of one state and one current observable. We further derive novel Inverse FRRs expressing individual state or current response in terms of a combination of covariances rather than vice versa. Using these relations, we demonstrate that the breaking of the Onsager symmetry requires the presence of state-current correlations. On the practical side, we demonstrate the applicability of FRRs for explaining the behavior of fluctuations in quantum dot devices or enzymatic reaction networks."

Between 10 MHz and 2 GHz, strong temperature-dependent resonance-like magnetic permeability dispersion was observed and attributed to the magnetic domain-wall dynamics. It is responsible for the high magnetic losses, absorption and shielding ability of NZF, and provides high nonlinearity and tunability of the permeability under a weak magnetic field. The attenuation constant of NZF is comparable to those of dielectric-conductor composites and giant permittivity materials. In the microwave range (2-50 GHz), three magnetic excitations dependent on a weak magnetic field were revealed and related to magnons. The lowest-frequency magnon (<10 GHz) is attributed to the natural ferromagnetic resonance, two others are excited between 28 and 44 GHz. Interaction of the magnons and magneto-dielectric resonance modes with electromagnetic waves provides high absorption and shielding efficiency in the GHz range, including 5G and 6G communication frequencies."

As a toy model, we study the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci quasiperiodic stub lattices that host flat energy spectra even in the presence of quasiperiodic hoppings. In the weak-coupling limit, we establish the relation between superfluid weight and the flux-space quantum metric in quasicrystal superconductors with flat energy spectra. Moreover, by analyzing the spread of Wannier functions, we propose a general fluctuation mechanism that explains how quasiperiodicity modulates the integrated flux-space quantum metric. Our theory provides a general way to examine the effect of the quantum geometry in systems lacking translational symmetry."

      "summary": "The time-reversal symmetry ($\\mathcal{T}$) breaking is a signature of ferromagnetism, giving rise to such phenomena as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and orbital magnetism. Nevertheless, $\\mathcal{T}$ can be also broken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or altermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light of this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such unconventional antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest ferromagnetic one, i.e. within the unit cell containing only one magnetic site. We show that such presentation is possible due to special form of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice hosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry constrains the form of the SO interaction, which becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\\{ \\mathcal{S}| {\\bf t} \\}$, combining the $180^{\\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\\mathcal{S}$) with the lattice shift ${\\bf t}$, connecting two antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. This is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets, which justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to the local coordinate frame with one magnetic site per cell. It naturally explains the emergence of AHE and net orbital magnetization, and provide transparent expressions for these properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating between AFM sublattices, as well as the orthorhombic strain, controlling the piezomagnetic response. The idea is illustrated on a number of examples including two-dimensional square lattice, monoclinic VF$_4$ and CuF$_2$, and RuO$_2$-type materials with the rutile structure, using for these purposes realistic models derived from first-principles calculations."

From now on, it is possible to determine, for each measured temperature and observed HFI, the set of \\emph{initial} electronic configurations around the probe nucleus and their associated EFGs, whose fluctuations produce these dynamic HFIs, rather than simply identifying the configuration that generates the stable final EFG when the dynamic process ends. We demonstrate the equivalence between the two most used methods for analyzing this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\\\"averstam \\emph{et al.} (BO approach) and Lupascu \\emph{et al.} (L approach), successfully connecting the relaxation constant $\\lambda$$_r$ (the damping strength of the TDPAC spectra) in the BO approach with the distribution's half-width $\\delta$$_i$ of the initial fluctuating EFGs in the L approach. To address this, we perform a comprehensive DFT study of Cd-doped $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed \\emph{ab initio} analysis of defect-formation energies, both as a function of the Cd impurity's charge state, to unravel controversial TDPAC results reported for ^{111}$In-implanted $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals, now revisited. These results quantitatively confirm the physical scenario underlying both the BO and L approaches, and this new method can also be applied to other TDPAC probes without EC."

We use the cluster expansion model to sample the configuration space via variance-constrained semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and develop SRO diagrams over a range of compositions and temperatures. Building on this with the percolation crossover model, specifically the variation of percolation threshold with SRO in the FCC lattice, we construct the first nearest-neighbor chemical percolation diagram.

Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs."

      "summary": "Entropically driven fluid-solid transitions in monodisperse, purely repulsive hard spheres (MPRHS) are well established in theory, simulation, and experiment for atomic and colloidal systems. For MPRHS, however, coexistence is usually located via bulk free-energy calculations; the underlying microscopic balance between configurational and vibrational entropy is left implicit. Frenkel clarified this mechanism explicitly as an exchange of long-range configurational entropy for short-range vibrational entropy, but in the pristine MPRHS limit the nucleation barrier near coexistence is so high that phase separation is predicted only on astronomical time scales. Consistent with this, even unbiased simulations do not show spontaneous, equilibrium fluid-crystal coexistence; transient mixtures are mostly overtaken by a single phase; observed coexistence is still algorithmically-driven. Nearly hard-sphere colloid experiments do observe fluid-crystal coexistence, but always in the presence of unavoidable triggers such as gravity, walls, and polydispersity. We treat the hard-sphere phase diagram as settled and ask how the entropic exchange mechanism can be revealed in nearly hard-sphere colloidal simulations. We probe the mechanism on finite time scales by introducing minimal perturbations that trigger phase separation: small reductions in hardness that increase locally accessible free volume (and thus gently increase vibrational entropy), and 2-4% distributed crystal seeds. These perturbations produce coexisting fluid and crystal domains with crystal fraction, phase envelope and osmotic pressure that, with systematically increasing particle hardness, approach the hard-sphere limit. These results demonstrate that slight enhancements to vibrational entropy provide a dynamically accessible route to realizing the long-range/short-range entropy exchange required for phase separation."

      "summary": "The rheological behavior of polymer melts is strongly influenced by parameters such as chain length, chain stiffness, and architecture. In particular, shear thinning, characterized by a power-law decrease in shear viscosity with increasing shear rate, has been widely investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. A central question is the connection between molecular conformation under steady flow and the resulting shear-thinning response. In this study, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of linear and ring polymers with varying chain stiffness to examine this relationship, with chain conformations quantified by the gyration tensor. We identified a strong correlation between the velocity-gradient direction component of the gyration tensor and shear viscosity, which exhibits a clear scaling relationship. This indicates that chain extension along the velocity-gradient direction governs the effective frictional force. Notably, this behavior emerges as a general feature, independent of chain architecture and chain stiffness. In addition, shear viscosity was found to correlate with the component of the gyration tensor corresponding to the direction that is not directly influenced by advective effects of shear flow. Because advection is absent in the direction, polymer chains can be regarded as diffusing freely, and the extent of this diffusion appears to be controlled by the shear viscosity."

      "summary": "We report dielectric and magnetoelectric studies of single-crystalline \\ce{CeMgAl11O19}, a Kramers triangular magnet embedded in a polarizable hexaaluminate lattice. In zero magnetic field, the permittivity $\\varepsilon'(T)$ follows the Barrett law of a quantum paraelectric down to 25 K, below which a broad minimum develops near 3 K without evidence of static ferroelectric or magnetic order. Application of magnetic fields up to \\SI{9}{\\tesla} shifts this minimum to higher temperatures and broadens it, evidencing a tunable magnetoelectric response.The magnetoelectric coupling was characterized using results from magnetization measurements. The anomaly temperature $T^*$, extracted from the local minimum of $\\varepsilon'(T)$, exhibits a linear dependence on the squared magnetization $M^2$, consistent with the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling allowed in centrosymmetric systems. This magnetoelectric effect, mediated by spin-orbit-entangled Kramers doublets interacting with a frustrated antipolar liquid, establishes \\ce{CeMgAl11O19} as a prototype for exploring quantum magnetoelectricity in frustrated systems."

      "summary": "Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water -- two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound -- through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through a propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility, and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about one order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure and indoor air quality."

      "summary": "The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems."

The zero-field dielectric response follows a Barrett-type quantum-paraelectric form, while a broad dielectric anomaly near 5 K shifts systematically to higher temperatures under applied magnetic fields, evidencing robust magnetoelectric coupling. The inverse permittivity (\\varepsilon'^{-1}(T,H)) scales linearly with (M^{2}), consistent with a biquadratic (P^{2}M^{2}) term in a Landau framework. Fits yield temperature-dependent coupling constants (\\lambda(T)) that decrease with heating, reflecting the thermal population of low-lying energy levels of Pr(^{3+}). These results identify PrMgAl(*{11})O(*{19}) as a paradigmatic non-Kramers hexaaluminate where quantum paraelectricity and magnetoelectric interactions are intrinsically entangled, establishing hexaaluminates as a tunable platform for magnetoelectric physics in frustrated quantum materials."

In this work, we develop a computational framework for exciton photoemission orbital tomography (exPOT) in periodic systems, enabling the simulation and interpretation of experimental observables within many-body perturbation theory. By connecting the GW +Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach to photoemission tomography, our formalism captures exciton photoemission in periodic systems, explicitly incorporating photoemission matrix element effects induced by the light-matter interaction via the probe pulse. The correlated nature of electrons and holes introduces distinct consequences for excitonic photoemission. Using the prototypical two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride, we demonstrate these effects, including a dependence of the photoemission angular distribution on the pump pulse polarization. Moreover, our framework extends to excitons with finite center-of-mass momentum, making it well-suited to studying momentum-dark excitons. This provides valuable insights into the microscopic nature of excitonic phenomena in quantum materials."

      "summary": "The functional renormalization group (fRG) is acknowledged as a powerful tool in quantum many-body physics and beyond. On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is an extension of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon."

      "summary": "Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities."

Sodium borosilicides clathrate outstands with uncommon stoichiometry and expected metallic properties, in contrast to other alkali metal semiconductive Zintl borosilicides. In this study, we report an experimental investigation of the high-pressure behavior of type-I and type-VIII sodium borosilicide clathrates. An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates. This transition is attributed to the pressure-induced diffusion of silicon atoms from the Si(6c) site. This mechanism provides the first experimental validation of a transition predicted theoretically for this class of materials. Isostructural phase transitions were only observed in type-I borosilicide. In contrast, the type-VIII borosilicide phase exhibits conventional elastic compression. The metallic character was established using reflectance spectroscopy over a wide energy range, in good agreement with crystallographic data on the boron content."

      "summary": "Materials with broken fundamental symmetries, such as chiral crystals, provide a rich playground for exploring unconventional spin-dependent transport phenomena. The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties."

      "summary": "In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intermediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be inferred through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentially the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dilate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguments for the general case."

Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials."

We report robust and reproducible quantized transport in a graphene quantum Hall topological insulator, stabilized at low magnetic fields by screening long-range Coulomb interactions with a metallic Bi$_2$Se$_3$ back gate. Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices."

This requires engineering systems with very low entropies, but the resulting temperature--interaction ratios $T/U$ of present experiments remain well above the domain where zero-temperature theories are expected to be reliable. The quantum-rotor approach (QRA), while analytically powerful and extremely flexible, inherits ground-state phase correlations and therefore breaks down once thermal winding of the phase field becomes significant. Here we construct a finite-temperature extension of QRA by (i) performing resummation of winding-number contributions for temperatures $k_{B}T/U\\lesssim 0.2$ and (ii) developing an auxiliary-variable expansion that remains accurate toward the classical limit. The resulting closed expression for the phase correlator is inserted into the standard spherical-approximation QRA without sacrificing the method's flexibility with respect to lattice geometry and dimensionality. The approach reproduces the shrinkage of Mott lobes from $T=0$ up to $k_{B}T/U\\simeq 0.2$ in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and with in-situ imaging experiments. This finite-T QRA thus supplies an analytic, computationally light tool for strongly correlated lattice bosons and sets the stage for amplitude-fluctuation upgrades required at higher temperatures."

While strain-dependent electrical resistivity has been extensively explored to probe nematicity, its influence on magneto-transport properties remains less understood. In this work, we present measurements of the magneto-elasto-resistivity in FeSe as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Using a minimal multiband Boltzmann model for transport we derive analytical expressions that capture the magnetic behavior of the whole set of experimental data both in the paramagnetic and in the nematic phase.

      "summary": "Monte-Carlo simulations are widely used to simulate complex molecular systems, but standard approaches suffer from metastability. Lately, the use of non-local proposal updates in a collective-variable (CV) space has been proposed in several works. Here, we generalize these approaches and explicitly spell out an algorithm for non-linear CVs and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove reversibility of the resulting scheme and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples, observing a substantial performance increase compared to methods based on overdamped Langevin dynamics as considered previously. Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems."

We first derive the critical condition for switching between reciprocity and nonreciprocity in the absence of magnon driving, and then numerically demonstrate that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can be achieved by violating this critical condition. When magnons are driven, we show that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can also be attained even within the critical condition. Compared to previous studies, the introduced nonlinear element not only relaxes the critical condition in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, but also offers an alternative means to tune magnonic nonreciprocity. Our work provides a promising avenue for realizing highly tunable nonreciprocal devices based on Kerr magnons."

The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments."

We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\\leq 0.1\\%$."

However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Focusing on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We provide evidence that the nature of the instability stems from stiffness of the dynamics of the variational parameters, despite the absence of stiffness in the exact quantum dynamics. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states."

The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that negativity or a non-classically enhanced escape rate is necessary to increase an output-to-dissipation ratio beyond classical limitations and show that the requirements are basis-independent and stronger than quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities."

In the real-parameter regime, the dynamical matrix is unitarily equivalent to four decoupled copies of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH2) model, thereby inheriting its topological phases and energy spectrum-including the M\\\"obius phase, a gapless topological phase with fractional winding number, having no Hermitian counterpart. We show that the dynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian time evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger dynamics or ad hoc normalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt amplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under periodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the M\\\"obius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be purely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a different version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases: trivial and non-trivial, and the M\\\"obius phase disappears. The latter system exhibits sublattice-dependent chiral amplification under open boundary conditions. We show that this amplification arises from the non-trivial topology of the dynamical matrix, establishing a clear link between topological phase and amplification behavior in the imaginary-parameter regime."

It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in contrast to quantum circuits and Brownian models, and is simple at the single-site level, in contrast to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev chains. It is analytically tractable for large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\\ln L)^2$. Besides being exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively similar to that in our solvable model."

Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations of fermions has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing."

Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical state-vector simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to ${6\\times 6}$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including different on-site electron-electron interaction strengths and magnetic flux values, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons (charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation), dynamical symmetry-breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled background state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that meaningful programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now feasible on state-of-the-art quantum hardware."

We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature."

In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges.

In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems."
