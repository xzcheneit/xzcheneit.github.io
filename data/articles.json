The two compounds combine to form a cubic double perovskite structure with ordered Nb$^{5+}$ and Ta$^{5+}$ cations. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born stability criteria, confirming mechanical stability; however, both K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 exhibit brittle behavior according to Pugh's ratio, reflecting limited ductility. Semiconducting behavior is revealed by band structure analysis with energy gaps of 2.79 eV for K2NbTaO6 and 2.63 eV for Rb2NbTaO6. Optical spectra show noticeable absorption in the high-energy region near the UV, indicating relevance for theoretical studies of optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes, without implying practical device efficiency.

The resulting symmetry group is a non-compact Lie group closely related to the Onsager algebra. For a symmetry-enforced Fermi surface $\\cal{F}$, we show that this UV symmetry group always includes the subgroup of the ersatz Fermi liquid L$_{\\cal{F}}$U(1) symmetry group formed by even functions ${f(\\mathbf{k})\\in\\mathrm{U}(1)}$ with ${\\mathbf{k}\\in \\cal{F}}$.

Exploiting the presence of a quantization axis, we use the Wigner--Eckart theorem to identify the allowed interband matrix elements and obtain compact analytic expressions for the quantum geometric tensor, the orbital magnetic moment, and the resulting orbital transport coefficients. The formalism applies to both multifold fermions and gapped $SU(2)$ models. Its versatility is demonstrated through explicit calculations in representative $SU(3)$ and $SU(4)$ settings, where orbital Edelstein and orbital Hall responses arise naturally from the antisymmetric components of the band geometry. Our results reveal a universal link between the algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian and emergent orbitronic phenomena."

      "summary": "Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a well known class of Pauli stabiliser Hamiltonians that furnish fixed-point realisations of nontrivial gapped phases such as symmetry breaking and topologically ordered (including fracton) phases. In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly. A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph. We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram."

      "summary": "Superconducting weak-link junctions host electron--hole hybridized excitations called Andreev bound states. These have attracted significant interest for the role they play in the device microelectronic operation and for quantum information applications. Andreev physics has so far been synonymous with the microwave range. However, the maturation of superconductor--semiconductor hybrid junctions opens the door to the characterization, and manipulation, of Andreev states by light. Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation. Given their natural microwave coupling, we show how Andreev bound states can operate as optical--to--microwave transducers. We illustrate these effects with realistic device parameters. Our results highlight the possibilities in the new field of Andreev optoelectronics."

      "summary": "We analyze a series of interacting Majorana Fermion chains with finite range pair interactions with coupling strength $g$ that all exhibit a tri-critical point that separates an Ising critical phase from a supersymmetric gapped phase. We first notice that the interacting models exhibit an even-odd asymmetry depending on the number of sites, $\\delta$, over which the interaction ranges. The even case exhibits competing order, thereby making it numerically untractable while the odd case exhibits an exactly solvable point at $g=-0.5$ where the entanglement entropy vanishes. By introducing a swirling geometrical twist, we map our 1D $\\delta$-range chains to a series of 2D $\\delta/2$-width models. Our new 2D models possess a unique helical boundary condition, constructed from 1D chains with the end of one connected to the start of another. We propose that the phase transition in the 1D system can be understood as a finite-system size transition in 2D. That is, the $g_c-\\delta$ behavior is controlled by a 2D tri-critical universality class at $\\delta\\to\\infty$ limit and is predicted by finite-size scaling theory."

Counterintuitively, this phenomenon is not linked to the closing of the Lindbladian gap in that limit. We provide analytical explanation for this unexpected behavior."

The high activation barriers associated with SiC defect formation and motion pose challenges for their study by first-principles molecular dynamics. In this work, we develop and deploy machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to accelerate defect dynamics simulations while retaining ab initio accuracy. We employ an active learning strategy comprising symmetry-adapted collective variable discovery and enhanced sampling to compile configurationally diverse training data, calculation of energies and forces using density functional theory (DFT), and training of an E(3)-equivariant MLIP based on the Allegro model. The trained MLIP reproduces DFT-level accuracy in defect transition activation free energy barriers, enables the efficient and stable simulation of multi-defect 216-atom supercells, and permits an analysis of the temperature dependence of defect thermodynamic stability and formation/annihilation kinetics to propose an optimal annealing temperature to maximally stabilize VV divacancies."

The buffer layer improves the structural quality of the AlInN layer, as evidenced by reduced full width at half maximum values in X-ray diffraction rocking curves around the AlInN (0002) peak. Atomic force microscopy reveals that the buffer layer does not alter surface roughness. The effectiveness of the a-Si buffer is demonstrated by an enhancement of the conversion efficiency under AM1.5G illumination from 3.3 % to 3.9 % for devices with 35 % Al. Looking at the effect of the Al content in devices with the a-Si buffer, the device with 22% Al shows the best photovoltaic performance, with a conversion efficiency of 4.1 % and a VOC of 0.42 V, JSC of 15.4 mA/cm2, and FF of 63.3%. However, performance declines for Al contents above 36% due to increased resistivity and reduced carrier concentration. These findings highlight the critical role of the novel a-Si buffer layer developed by RF-sputtering and the Al content in optimizing AlInN/Si heterojunction solar cell performance."

      "summary": "Recently, coexisting ferroelectricity and superconductivity were reported in bilayer T$_{\\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene. Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\\textrm{r}}<P_{\\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification."

      "summary": "Tailoring the chemical composition of a high entropy oxide (HEO) is a powerful approach to enhancing desirable material properties. However, the targeted synthesis of HEO materials is often hindered by competing stabilizing and destabilizing factors, which are difficult to predict. This work examines the effects of increased configurational entropy on the phase formation and stability of four notable complex oxide families: perovskite ($AB$O$_3$}), pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$), Ruddlesden-Popper ($A_2B$O$_4$), and zirconium tungstate ($AB_2$O$_8$). Each of these structures has a tetravalent cation site, which we attempt to substitute with an entropic mixture of four cations, benchmarked by the parallel synthesis of a non-disordered reference compound. While all four target high entropy materials can be expected to form based on ionic radii criteria, only the high entropy perovskite Ba(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_3$ is successfully synthesized. In the case of the pyrochlore, an entropy-stabilized defect fluorite is formed instead, while the Ruddlesden-Popper phase co-exists with multiple competing phases. For the tungstate, an unexpected deep eutectic point between the precursors results in melting that precedes the formation of a high entropy phase. Our case studies therefore illustrate that the stability of HEOs cannot be straightforwardly predicted based on ionic radii, lattice geometry, and charge-balancing considerations alone due to the underlying complexity of the interactions between the many chemical constituents."

      "summary": "Copper-graphene composite (CGC) conductors are widely considered as a potential alternative to pure copper (Cu). Yet, the effect of graphene (Gr) on the electrical conductivity of CGCs remains elusive, and their electrical performance is still controversial. This work addresses these unresolved questions by unambiguously quantifying how the electrical properties of CGCs depend on the characteristics of Gr and Cu. Gr is synthesized on Cu foils, foams, and wires by utilizing a wide range of chemical vapor deposition conditions to independently control their characteristics. Then the Gr-enhanced electrical conductivity ({\\Delta}{\\sigma}) is characterized for CGCs with different Cu geometries and Gr qualities. This study confirms that unprecedented electrical conductivity ({\\Delta}{\\sigma} = 17.1%) can be achieved only when both Gr and Cu are carefully optimized. Specifically, the study reveals three key factors: (1) {\\Delta}{\\sigma} is positively correlated with continuity of Gr; (2) CGCs with a continuous monolayer Gr exhibit a strong {\\Delta}{\\sigma}-A_s linear relation where A_s is the specific surface area of a CGC; and (3) {\\Delta}{\\sigma} becomes more pronounced when a Cu matrix has a curved cross-section. This work reveals the fundamental mechanisms of how Gr influences the overall electrical conductivity of CGCs and, therefore, is a crucial step toward designing and manufacturing high-performance CGC conductors for emerging applications."

Recent studies reveal that the filling anomaly for the cases with genus $0$ is universally given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position $1a$. In this study, we rewrite the formula in terms of the degree of sharpness of the corner, and show that the corner charge formula also holds for cases with arbitrary genus. We also extend our formula to vertex-transitive shell polyhedra, which are closed or open polyhedra without the bulk region, with all the vertices related by symmetry. Then, we show that the corner charges of such shell polyhedra are equal to the two-dimensional disclination charges of the corresponding disclinations. By identifying it with the disclination charge under the Wen-Zee action, we show that the coupling constant of the Wen-Zee action for a crystalline insulator is given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position at the disclination core."

      "summary": "Understanding the phase behaviour of pheromones and other messaging molecules remains a significant and largely unexplored challenge, even though it plays a central role in chemical communication. Here, we present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the behavior of bombykol, a model insect pheromone, adsorbed at the water-air interface. This system serves as a proxy for studying the amphiphilic nature of pheromones and their interactions with aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Our simulations reveal the molecular organization of the bombykol monolayer and its adsorption isotherm. A soft-sticky particle equation of state accurately describes the monolayer's behavior. The analysis uncovers a two-dimensional liquid-gas phase transition within the monolayer. Collective adsorption stabilises the molecules at the interface and the calculated free energy gain is approximately $2\\:k_\\mathrm{B}T$. This value increases under lower estimates of the condensing surface concentration, thereby enhancing pheromone adsorption onto aerosols. Overall, our findings hold broad relevance for molecular interface science, atmospheric chemistry, and organismal chemical communication, particularly in highlighting the critical role of phase transition phenomena."

      "summary": "Nitrogen, the most abundant element in Earth's atmosphere, exists as a diatomic gas under standard temperature and pressure. In the two-dimensional (2D) limit, atomically thin nitrogen, termed nitrogene, has been theoretically predicted to form crystalline materials with various polymorphic configurations, exhibiting diverse chemical and physical properties. However, the synthesis of nitrogene has remained elusive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds. Here, we report experimental evidence of the formation of nitrogen-based crystalline structures compatible with nitrogene on silver surfaces via ion-beam-assisted epitaxy. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the nitrogene-like structure adopts a puckered honeycomb lattice. Notably, our calculations predict a nitrogene band gap of up to 7.5 eV, positioning it as a promising candidate for ultraviolet optoelectronic devices and high-k dielectric applications."

Numerical simulation of a model CuZr alloy reveal that $d_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ increases upon cooling but saturates near the first peak of the radial distribution function just before SE breakdown. This saturation defines a geometric upper bound for the collisional cross-section beyond which further slowdown is governed by cooperative, heterogeneous motion rather than local collisional transport. Our analysis yields a compact criterion for SE breakdown in a mean-field perspective and provides physically interpretable inputs for future data-driven models of glassy dynamics."

      "summary": "Equimolar ratio high-entropy perovskite ceramics (HEPCs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent magnetization intensity. To further enhance their magnetization intensities, (Ln0.2La0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Eu0.2)MnO3 (Ln = Dy, Ho and Er, labeled as Ln-LNSEMO) HEPCs are designed based on the configuration entropy Sconfig, tolerance factor t, and mismatch degree. Single-phase HEPCs are synthesized by the solid-phase method in this work, in which the effects of the heavy rare-earth elements Dy, Ho and Er on the structure and magnetic properties of Ln-LNSEMO are systematically studied. The results show that all Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit high crystallinity and maintain excellent structural stability after sintering at 1250 degree centigrade for 16 h. Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit significant lattice distortion effects, with smooth surface morphology, clearly distinguishable grain boundaries, and irregular polygonal shapes. The three high-entropy ceramic samples exhibit hysteresis behavior at T = 5 K, with the Curie temperature TC decreasing as the radius of the introduced rare-earth ions decreases, while the saturation magnetization and coercivity increase accordingly. When the average ionic radius of A-site decreases, the interaction between their valence electrons and local electrons in the crystal increases, thereby enhancing the conversion of electrons to oriented magnetic moments under an external magnetic field. Thus, Er-LNSEMO HEPC shows a higher saturation magnetization strength (42.8 emu/g) and coercivity (2.09 kOe) than the other samples, which is attributed to the strong magnetic crystal anisotropy, larger lattice distortion (0.00652), smaller average grain size (440.49 plus or minus 22.02 nm), unit cell volume (229.432 A3) and A-site average ion radius (1.24 A) of its magnet. The Er-LNSEMO HEPC has potential applications in magnetic recording materials."

      "summary": "Despite the decades that have passed since the discovery of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and its apparent simplicity, this method is still often subject to experimental errors and misinterpretations when applied to 2D semiconductors. The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors."

Both settings are modeled as interacting particle systems on a 1D price lattice, with temporal evolution described by master equations that account for new entries, cancellations, and executions. The key insight is the introduction of a preferential interaction parameter $\\Psi$, which modulates the likelihood of transactions based on price compatibility: when $\\Psi=0$, interactions are random and uncoordinated, reproducing the structure of informal markets; as $\\Psi\\to \\infty$, only optimal (most mutually attractive) trades occur, recovering LOB-like dynamics. A grand-canonical interpretation is used to identify effective thermodynamic quantities -such as interaction energy and price-dependent chemical potentials -that underlie both systems. Most results are validated through numerical integration and simulations, although an analytical solution is shown to exist at least for the symmetric stationary case of the informal market."

      "summary": "We present a data-efficient framework for constructing general classical spin Hamiltonians from the spin-cluster expansion (SCE) combined with fully self-consistent noncollinear spin density functional theory (DFT). The key idea is to fit an SCE model to magnetic torques rather than to total energies. Because torques are site-resolved vectors, each configuration supplies many independent constraints, which makes the regression well conditioned and sharply reduces the number of DFT calculations needed, especially in large supercells. Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\\rm Fe}_{x}{\\rm Ge}$ and ${\\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\\rm Co}_{y}{\\rm Ge}$, the resulting models nonperturbatively extract the full pairwise exchange tensor (isotropic exchange, anisotropic symmetric exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction) and predict helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period near the chirality sign change are reproduced in line with experiments. Because the SCE framework is systematic, it also enables systematic analysis of interaction order; training on increasingly disordered spin configurations shows that the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex textures at modest data cost, while providing a systematic, extensible, and nonperturbative route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design. An open-source implementation is available as the Julia package, \\textit{Magesty.jl}."

      "summary": "Viscosity calculation from equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations relies on the traditional Green-Kubo (GK) framework, which integrates the stress autocorrelation function (SACF) over time. While the formalism is exact in the linear response regime, the traditional approach often suffers from poor convergence and requires extensive phase space sampling, which is computationally demanding for soft matter and polymer systems. In this Letter, we introduce a hybrid Green-Kubo (hGK) framework that alleviates these limitations by partitioning the SACF into two physically meaningful regimes: (i) a short time ballistic component extracted directly from short MD simulations, and (ii) a long time relaxation tail represented using analytically motivated functions, $\\phi(\\tau)$, fitted only to short trajectories. This strategy bypasses the need for extensive sampling while preserving physical rigor. Benchmarking against SPC/E water confirms excellent agreement with established results, and we further demonstrate the efficacy of the method for challenging electrolyte systems (EC-LiTFSI and PEO-LiTFSI), for which the GK framework fails to converge. The computational savings are substantial, with reductions of several orders of magnitude in required sampling, achieved without compromising predictive accuracy. We also discuss the limitations of the hGK framework and outline clear avenues for refinement, including optimal tail selection and robust identification of relaxation regimes in noisy stress data. The hGK framework presented in this Letter provides a conceptually simple, broadly applicable, and computationally efficient route for viscosity prediction in molecular liquids, polymer melts, and ionically conducting soft materials."

A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed."

      "summary": "Persson's theory of purely normal rough surface contact was developed two decades ago during the study of tire-road interaction, and gradually became one of the dominant approaches to study the solid-solid interaction between rough surfaces. Contrary to its popular applications in various cross-disciplinary fields, the fundamental study of Persson's theory of contact attracted little attention from the tribology and contact mechanics communities. As far as the authors know, many researchers struggle to understand the derivation of the theory. Few attempts have been made to clarify the oversimplified derivation provided by Persson (Persson, 2001). The present work provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory, which does not simply follow the commonly adopted derivation initiated by Persson. A new derivation is given based on stochastic process theory, assuming that the variation of the random contact pressure with respect to scale is a Markov process. We revisit the essential assumptions utilized to derive the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, drift and diffusion coefficients, and closed-form results. This tutorial can serve as a self-consistent introduction for solid mechanicians, tribologists, and postgraduate students who are not familiar with Persson's theory, or who struggle to understand it."

Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology."

      "summary": "The great potential of memristive devices for real-world applications still relies on overcoming key technical challenges, including the need for a larger number of stable resistance states, faster switching speeds, lower SET/RESET voltages, improved endurance, and reduced variability. One material optimization strategy that has still been quite overlooked is interface engineering, specifically, tailoring the electrode/dielectric interface to modulate oxygen exchange. Here, we demonstrate that introducing materials with high ionic mobility can significantly expand the accessible oxygen concentration range within the dielectric layer, significantly broadening the memory window. Using SrTiO3-based memristive stacks, we integrated an ion-conducting SrCoO3 interfacial layer to facilitate oxygen transfer, increasing the number of distinguishable resistance states from 8 to 22. This modification also reduced the SET/RESET voltage by 50% and markedly improved device endurance, albeit with a trade-off of reduced state retention. To assess the practical implications of this trade-off, we trained a two-layer fully connected neural network using the experimental SrTiO3/SrCoO3 memristor characteristics on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Networks with hidden-layer sizes between 64 and 256 memristive elements achieved classification errors below 7%. The observed temporal drift means the functional state must be updated at intervals of less than 1 h to maintain reliable operation. Finally, we confirmed the transferability of this interface-engineering approach by applying it to HfOx-based devices, achieving a similarly enhanced memory window."

      "summary": "Ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelates has been capped at an onset transition temperature (Tc) of ~40 K, a value that remains lower than the cuprate (~133 K) and iron-based (~55 K) counterparts, despite the promise shown under high pressure. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at ~63 K in epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films grown under compressive strain on SrLaAlO4 substrates. This Tc leap is enabled by pushing our gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) method into an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. It leverages powerful in situ oxidation to simultaneously enhance kinetics via higher temperatures and achieve full oxygenation without post-annealing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm that this approach yields films of large-scale crystalline purity, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. These films exhibit a systematic evolution in their normal-state resistivity-temperature curve: the power-law exponent $\\alpha$ evolves from Fermi-liquid-like ($\\alpha$ ~2) at lower Tc to strange-metal-like ($\\alpha$ ~1) in higher Tc samples, directly linking the enhanced superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid behavior. Mapping the vortex melting phase diagram by the mutual inductance technique further reveals 2D melting limit suppressed to near zero, which demonstrates significantly stronger interlayer coupling than that of cuprates. These results identify the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system exhibiting strange-metal behavior, presenting an alternative framework to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm."

      "summary": "Scalable quantum computing currently requires a large array of qubit integration, but present two-dimensional interconnects face challenges such as wiring congestion, electromagnetic interference, and limited cryogenic space. To overcome this challenge, implementing three-dimensional (3D) vertical architectures becomes crucial. Niobium (Nb), due to its excellent superconducting characteristics and strong fabrication process compatibility, stands out as a prime material choice. The main challenge in Nb-Nb bonding is the presence of an oxide layer at the interface, even after post-bonding annealing across various bonding methods. The native Nb oxide forms rapidly in air, creating a resistive barrier to supercurrent flow and introducing two-level system losses that degrade qubit coherence while increasing the overall thermal budget. These issues show the need for effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation during bonding. This study introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface. This approach enables low-temperature Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 {\\deg}C under a reduced bonding pressure of 0.495 MPa. Detailed microstructural and interfacial analyses confirm that Au passivation effectively suppresses oxide formation and hence enhances bonding uniformity and strength with keeping the superconductivity, establishing a robust route toward low-temperature, low-pressure Nb-Nb bonding for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing architectures."

Here, we employ a high-throughput screening strategy, applying a multi-step filter to the Materials Project database (>154,000 materials), which yielded 2,519 candidate materials for detailed first-principle evaluation. From these calculations, we identify 32 NLO materials with strong shift current response ($\\sigma$ > 100 $\\mu A/V^2$). Our work reveals that layered structures with $C_{3v}$ symmetry and heavy $p$-block elements (e.g. Te, Sb) exhibit apparent superiority in enhancing shift current. More importantly, 9 of these compounds show shift current response peaks in the IR region, with the strongest reaching 616 $\\mu A/V^2$, holding significant application potential in fields such as IR photodetection, sensing, and energy harvesting. Beyond identifying promising candidates, this work establishes a comprehensive and high-quality first-principles dataset for NLO response, providing a solid foundation for future AI-driven screening and accelerated discovery of high-performance NLO materials, as demonstrated by a prototype machine-learning application."

Although simulations combining Green-Kubo (GK) molecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials (MLPs) stand as a promising approach, substantial challenges remain due to the crucial impact of atomic diffusion. Here, we first show that the thermal conductivity (${\\kappa}$) of superionic materials calculated via conventional GK integral of the energy flux varies notably with the MLP model. Subsequently, we highlight that reliable, model-independent $\\kappa$ values can be obtained by applying Onsager's reciprocal relations to correctly capture the coupled heat and mass transport. Remarkably, an anomalously invariant $\\kappa$ is observed over a wide temperature range, distinct from the characteristic trends in traditional crystals and glasses. Finally, we illustrate that conventional $\\kappa$ decompositions into kinetic, potential, and cross terms suffer from ambiguities in the physical interpretation, despite their mathematical rigor."

On the level of cellular chemical reaction networks, maximising fitness can mean optimising a variety of fitness functions such as robustness, precision, or sensitivity to external stimuli. Using theory and numerics, we show that these diverse goals can be achieved by a versatile, generic mechanism: coupling chemical reaction networks to reservoirs that are strongly out of equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the degree of optimality achievable by this mechanism saturates, and that nature appears to operate near saturation. We find that the amount of heat generated by this mechanism constitutes a significant fraction of the total heat produced by living organisms, so that 'life is hot' largely because of the need for a versatile mechanism to optimise a variety of fitness functions."

The influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on the persistent current is systematically analyzed. To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current."

Our analytical theory allows us to understand why one of the phase transitions remains sharp. This is due to a cancellation of the dissipation effects on the nontrivial nature of the intertwined order parameter of one of the phases."

Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen.

Two Janus configurations are considered: i) one bilayer where the two intralayer polarizations caused by Janus chemical asymmetry cancel each other out, yielding photocurrent spectra comparable to pristine MoSe$_2$ bilayers; ii) another bilayer where the intralayer polarizations add up, for which the photoresponses are strongly enhanced. Our results show that photocurrent generation in the polar Janus structures is predominantly governed by vertical chemical asymmetry, with limited dependence on the sliding direction. These findings highlight complementary design strategies: interlayer sliding enables sensitivity to external tuning, while the Janus intralayer polarization enhances photoresponses in the visible range. The interplay between composition and stacking therefore provides a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions in 2D ferroelectric materials."

While Sak's criterion, $\\sigma_* = 2 - \\eta_{\\mathrm{SR}}$, has been widely accepted, recent studies of two-dimensional (2D) models with long-range interactions have challenged it. In this work, we focus on the crossover between LR and SR criticality in several classical 2D statistical models, including the XY, Heisenberg, percolation, and Ising models, whose interactions decay as $1/r^{2+\\sigma}$. Our previous simulations for the XY, Heisenberg, and percolation models consistently indicate a universal boundary at $\\sigma_* = 2$. Here, we complete the picture by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D LR-Ising model, reaching lattice sizes up to $L = 8192$. By analyzing the Fortuin-Kasteleyn critical polynomial $R_p$, the Binder ratio $Q_m$, and the anomalous dimension $\\eta$, we obtain convergent and self-consistent evidence that the universality class already changes sharply at $\\sigma = 2$. Taken together, these results establish a unified scenario for LR interacting systems: across all studied models, the crossover from LR to SR universality occurs at $\\sigma_* = 2$."

Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$\\pi$ transitions."

The composite integrates narrow-bandgap CuO, plasmonic Ag/AgCl, and visible-responsive g-C3N4 into a dual Z-scheme configuration that promotes efficient interfacial charge transfer while preserving strong redox potentials. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra ascertained the bandgap positions of the composite corresponding to those of its constituents: 2.9 eV (g-C3N4) and 1.42 eV (Ag-doped CuO-AgCl), indicating enhanced absorption and efficient charge carrier generation. BET analysis confirmed the presence of mesoporosity and revealed an effective surface area, ensuring the availability of abundant adsorption and reaction sites. A commercial 11 W UV irradiation was used for the photocatalytic test. Almost complete degradation of MB occurred within 10 min, following pseudo-first-order kinetics with a high apparent rate constant of 0.45/min. The remarkable activity arises from the synergistic interplay of Fenton-like redox cycling and efficient photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation. In addition, it has been demonstrated that intentionally incorporated AgCl plays an active role as a plasmonic-semiconducting interface, strengthening charge separation and catalyst stability under neutral conditions, rather than acting as a passive chloride byproduct. Overall, by linking defect engineering, heterojunction design, and photo-Fenton synergy, this study establishes a low-power, catalytic platform offering a viable pathway towards sustainable dye wastewater remediation."

      "summary": "Interband effects such as coherence/tunneling have recently been shown to give an important contribution to the charge and heat transport properties under certain conditions. These can be captured by adding corrective terms to the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation. In recent derivations of this type of transport equations that are based on the density matrix formalism, there remain, however, certain omissions. These derivations also rely on a particular type of relaxation time approximation and a band-diagonal form of the interaction self-energies. In this work we derive the interband terms of the electronic Boltzmann transport equation starting from the Keldysh formulation of the quantum kinetic equation and considering the band non-diagonality of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon self-energies. We introduce a minimally modified Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz, and find a quantum-corrected, matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is well beyond the current state of the art theory. We show that the occupations and coherences are interdependent, and that the kinetic corrections due to the included interactions cannot, in general, be ignored. This work clarifies the various approximations that must be introduced in an ab initio derivation of Boltzmann-like equations and finds a new matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is suitable for parameters-free numerical implementations."

      "summary": "Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity. We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping."

      "summary": "Biological systems sense and extract information from fluctuating signals while operating under energetic constraints and limited resolution. We introduce a general chemical model in which a sensor, coupled to a signaling pathway activated by hidden signals, can allosterically tune the production of a readout molecule. We propose viable strategies for the sensor to estimate, and eventually balance, information gathering on the hidden process and the associated dissipative cost relying solely on counting statistics of observed trajectories. We show that these strategies can be successfully implemented to adapt the readout production even with finite-time measurements and limited dynamic resolution, and remain effective in the presence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a plausible mechanism to actively balance information and dissipation, paving the way for an implementable design principle underpinning biological and biochemical adaptation."

Sodium borosilicides clathrate outstands with uncommon stoichiometry and expected metallic properties, in contrast to other alcali metal semiconductive Zintl borosilicides. In this study, we report an experimental investigation of the high-pressure behavior of type-I and type-VIII sodium borosilicide clathrates. An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates. This transition is attributed to the pressure-induced diffusion of silicon atoms into cationic sites. This mechanism provides the first experimental validation of a transition predicted theoretically for this class of materials. Isostructural phase transitions were only observed in type-I borosilicide. In contrast, the type-VIII borosilicide phase exhibits conventional elastic compression. The metallic character was established using reflectance spectroscopy over a wide energy range, in good agreement with crystallographic data on the boron content."

This first-principle approach is expected to provide an excellent description of interfaces, strains, and atomistic disorder without empirically fitted parameters. We benchmark atomistic tight- binding (TB) and the ``$2k_0$'' theory within the effective mass (EM) approximation against DFT. We show that DFT supports the main conclusions of the 2$k_0$ theory, but reveals some limitations of semi-empirical methods such as the EM and TB, in particular about the description of atomistic disorder. The DFT calculations also highlight the effects of strong valley-orbit mixing at large valley splittings. Nevertheless, TB and the 2$k_0$ theory shall provide reasonable valley splitting statistics in many heterostructures of interest for spin qubit devices."

      "summary": "Thermal plasma has emerged as an effective approach for producing carbon nanostructures without the need for specific catalysts nor substrates. While efforts have focused on the effect of process parameters such as reaction pressure, input power or carbon source, the intricate role and relationship with plasma characteristics like density and temperature are often overlooked due to the complexity of the environment. This study addresses this gap by establishing a correlation between process parameters, plasma characteristics, and product morphology, essential for controlling the growth of carbon nanostructures. We explored the impact of carbon precursor type (CH4 and C2H2), hydrogen, pressure, and flow rate on nanostructure formation. Using in situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES), we mapped the distribution of both temperature and dicarbon molecule (C2) density within the plasma jet. We demonstrate that the growth of low-density nanostructures, such as carbon nanohorns (CNHs), is favoured at dilute C2 local densities and high temperatures, while denser nanostructures, such as onion-like polyhedral graphitic nanocapsules (GNCs), are favoured at higher C2 densities and lower temperatures. The carbon density can be controlled by the flow rate and the pressure, which in turn significantly influence the nanostructure morphology, evolving from graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) to GNCs as either parameter increases. Increasing the H/C ratio from 1 to 8 resulted in a morphological transition from CNHs to GNFs. During the synthesis, the plasma jet temperature surpassed 3,000 K, with crystalline growth occurring 50 to 100 mm below the nozzle."

      "summary": "The emergence of intelligent matter has sparked significant interest in next generation technologies. We report on the discovery of a reconfigurable magnetic multilayer domain structure in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr, exhibiting a unique combination of magnetic and optical properties. Applying an external magnetic field along the easy axis drives the hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition that is not universally binary, but instead develops through a cascade of intermediate magnetic configurations whose multiplicity and stability scale systematically with thickness. This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure. The directly linked optical properties of CrSBr, modulated by the magnetic structure, provide a readout mechanism for the stored information compatible with modern information distribution using light. With its adaptive properties, CrSBr is an attractive candidate for neuromorphic circuitries, enabling the design of brain-inspired computing architectures that can learn and evolve in response to changing environments."

      "summary": "The total energy is a fundamental characteristic of solids, molecules, and nanostructures. In most first-principles calculations of the total energy, the nuclear kinetic operator is decoupled from the many-body electronic Hamiltonian and the dynamics of the nuclei is reintroduced afterwards. This two-step procedure introduced by Born and Oppenheimer (BO) is approximate. Energies beyond the electronic and vibrational (or phononic) main contributions might be relevant when small energy differences are important, such as when predicting stable polymorphs or describing magnetic energy landscape. We clarify the different flavors of BO decoupling and give an exact formulation for the total energy in the basis of BO electronic wavefunctions. Then, we list contributions, beyond the main ones, that appear in a perturbative expansion in powers of $M_0^{-1/4}$, where $M_0$ is a typical nuclear mass, up to sixth order. Some of these might be grouped and denoted the electron-phonon contribution to total energy, $E^{\\textrm{elph}}$, that first appears at fourth order. The electronic inertial mass contributes at sixth order. We clarify that the sum of the Allen-Heine-Cardona zero-point renormalization of eigenvalues over occupied states is not the electron-phonon contribution to the total energy but a part of the phononic contribution. The computation of the lowest-order $E^{\\textrm{elph}}$ is implemented and shown to be small but non-negligible (3.8 meV per atom) in the case of diamond and its hexagonal polymorph. We also estimate the electronic inertial mass contribution and confirm the size-consistency of all computed terms."

      "summary": "An electric bias can shift the Fermi level along the Dirac cone of a topological insulator and modify its charge transport, but tuning the electronic states and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) without destroying the surface topology is challenging. Here, we show that thin film Bi2Se3/n-p (p-n) molecular diodes form ordered interfaces where charge transfer and orbital re-hybridisation result in a decrease (increase) of the carrier density and improved mobility. In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points. Raman spectroscopy gives evidence that the coupling effect may be controlled by optical irradiation, opening a pathway towards the design of heavy-light element hybrids with optically tunable quantum transport."

Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10."

The magnetic state of strained or doped thin films remains controversial, but evidence for a nontrivial magnetic state is ample. Here, I study the altermagnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ on a higher rung of Jacob's ladder of density functional approximations, the meta-GGA level including the kinetic energy density and the density Laplacian. While the workhorse functional of solid-state physics is a generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the modern r$^2$SCAN-L functional has been established as a general-purpose functional which can replace GGA, while systematically improving solid-state properties without introducing spurious errors like erroneous magnetic ground states. Comparison of LSDA+U, GGA+U, and meta-GGA+U results on RuO$_2$ shows systematic enhancement of the exchange interaction, leading to a reduction of the onset value of the Hubbard $U$ parameter at different levels of density functional approximation. However, the magnetic ground state, studied at the experimental lattice constants, remains nonmagnetic with r$^2$SCAN-L. I demonstrate that altermagnetism is easily formed upon lattice expansion, hole doping, and uniaxial strain on the c-axis. The r$^2$SCAN-L calculations set conservative thresholds for distortions and doping levels for the onset of altermagnetism in a parameter-free framework."

Nevertheless, their functionality strongly depends on the surface onto which they are deposited, and on the interaction between the molecules and the substrate itself, which often leads to an undesired alteration in their electronic properties. In this study, we use a phosphorus interlayer on a Cu(110) surface as a buffer layer for the electronic decoupling of Zinc-TetraPhenylPorphyrin (ZnTPP) molecules. Using a combination of complementary techniques, such as Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS), X-ray and Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS, UPS) as well as Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) techniques, it is shown how the charge transfer from the metal, responsible for quenching the ZnTPP lowest unoccupied molecular level (LUMO) levels, is effectively prevented by the presence of a phosphorus reconstruction in between."

Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \\to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic band structures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the B\\\"uttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the Hall response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer Hall-like signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects."

Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $\\mu$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor.

      "summary": "Discoveries over the past two decades have revealed the remarkable ability of quantum materials to emulate relativistic properties of the vacuum, from Dirac cones in graphene to the Weyl surface states of topological insulators. Yet the most elusive consequence of topology in quantum matter is the axionic $E\\cdot B$ term in the electromagnetic response. Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $\\mu_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \\cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism. Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications."

The spiral inductor's distributed inter-turn capacitance yields distinct resonant modes with varied impedance-matching conditions. By probing a quantum dot across several modes, we extract tunneling rates over a broad frequency range and identify signatures of nearby charge defects. Using one of the higher-order modes, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout via a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET), achieving singlet-triplet readout with an integration time of 8 us and a readout fidelity of 98%. These results establish multimode inductance as a scalable and flexible component for fast spin-qubit readout and device-quality characterization."

We show that a collection of such ballistic quasiparticles remains stable against sufficiently weak pointlike charge impurities, a feature captured by the vanishing average [$\\rho_{a}(0)$] and typical [$\\rho_{t}(0)$] DOS at zero energy, computed by employing the kernel polynomial method in sufficiently large $\\{ 10, 3\\}$ hyperbolic lattices (Schl\\\"afli symbol) with more than $10^8$ and $10^5$ sites, respectively, with open boundary conditions. However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $\\rho_{a}(0)$ and $\\rho_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $\\rho_{t}(0) \\to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $\\rho_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached."

      "summary": "The electron flux diverts electrons from optimal hydrogen production pathways to competitive pathways, which overall reduces the efficiency of the photo fermentation hydrogen production (PFHP) system. For tackling electron flux and metabolic pathway regulation, a hybrid material (nano-capattery (NC)) was developed based on cobalt-iron-nitrogen doped biochar (Co-Fe-NBC). The NC possessed both the capacitor property (287.91 F/g) and battery-like charge storage 38.3 mC/g with the highest energy density of 159.95 mWh/g. These properties existed due to its Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox cycle ability, a highly porous surface (291.81 m2/g BET surface area) caused by the defects (AD/AG 3.13) and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) observed through electro paramagnetic resonance. During PFHP, there is an 85% reduction in propionic acid, a 65.3% record electron management efficiency, an improved 1.34 NAD+/NADH ratio, along with a 87% increase in dehydrogenase activity, confirming the superior role of NC in efficient regulation of the metabolic pathway and electron flux management. These exceptional properties of biochar-based NC raised the cumulative hydrogen production from 151.03 mL (control) to 589.54 mL, which was an enormous increase of 367%."

We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities."

We consider the problem of brittle failure in an elastic bar previously solved in (Rosakis et al 2021). Despite the presence of a non-zero interfacial/surface energy, the third derivative of the inverse-deformation map is discontinuous at the crack faces. This is due to the presence of the inequality constraint ensuring the inverse strain is nonnegative and the orientation of matter is preserved. A change in the material location of a crack results in negative entropy production, violating the second law. Consequently, such changes are disallowed giving the irreversibility condition. The inequality constraint and the irreversibility condition limit the space of admissible variations. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability that incorporate these restrictions. Their numerical implementation shows that all broken equilibria found in (Rosakis et al 2021) are locally stable."

      "summary": "The variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), has been widely used to find the ground state energy of different Hamiltonians with no analytical solutions and are classically difficult to compute. In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1"

      "summary": "In quantum field theory (QFT), the \"vacuum\" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries."

      "summary": "The hallmark of two-dimensional chiral topological phases is the existence of anomalous gapless modes at the spatial boundary. Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating \"permutation defects\" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices."

Spin-polarized DFT calculations on 240 bimetallic clusters reveal systematic trends in binding and formation energies, distortion penalties, effective coordination number, d-band centre, and HOMO-LUMO gap that govern the competition between core-shell (in) and surface-segregated (out) arrangements. We then pretrain a transformer architecture on a curated set of 2968 unary clusters from the Quantum Cluster Database and fine-tune it on bimetallic data to predict formation energies and in/out preference, achieving mean absolute errors of about $0.6-0.7$eV and calibrated uncertainty intervals. The resulting model rapidly adapts to an unseen Fe-host domain with only a handful of labelled examples.

      "summary": "This book introduces the new research area of Geometric Data Science, where data can represent any real objects through geometric measurements. The first part of the book focuses on finite point sets. The most important result is a complete and continuous classification of all finite clouds of unordered points under rigid motion in any Euclidean space. The key challenge was to avoid the exponential complexity arising from permutations of the given unordered points. For a fixed dimension of the ambient Euclidean space, the times of all algorithms for the resulting invariants and distance metrics depend polynomially on the number of points. The second part of the book advances a similar classification in the much more difficult case of periodic point sets, which model all periodic crystals at the atomic scale. The most significant result is the hierarchy of invariants from the ultra-fast to complete ones. The key challenge was to resolve the discontinuity of crystal representations that break down under almost any noise. Experimental validation on all major materials databases confirmed the Crystal Isometry Principle: any real periodic crystal has a unique location in a common moduli space of all periodic structures under rigid motion. The resulting moduli space contains all known and not yet discovered periodic crystals and hence continuously extends Mendeleev's table to the full crystal universe."

We show that the nonadiabatic entropy production, which quantifies deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state, exhibits universal power-law scaling with the ramp duration in analogy to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for closed systems. This establishes the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving an open quantum system near criticality. Furthermore, in systems described by bosonic Gaussian states, our scaling laws predict that the nonadiabatic entropy production is independent of driving speed to leading order, revealing a distinctive feature of Gaussian dissipative quantum phase transitions. We validate these analytical predictions in the thermodynamic limit of the driven-dissipative Dicke model and via finite-size scaling in the open Kerr model. Our results establish a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems."

This study explores the anisotropic thermal behavior of metamaterials composed of planar plates perforated with periodic arrays of cylinders possessing elliptical cross sections. In contrast to conventional circular perforations, elliptical geometries inherently break rotational symmetry, introducing anisotropy in the effective electromagnetic and thermal response of the structure. Using a fluctuation electrodynamics framework combined with full-wave numerical simulations, we quantify the near-field radiative heat transfer between such elliptically perforated plates as a function of ellipse orientation, aspect ratio, and separation distance. The results reveal that elliptical perforations enable enhanced spectral and directional control of evanescent mode coupling and surface polariton excitation, leading to significant modulation of the near-field heat flux. These findings highlight the potential of geometrically engineered anisotropy for advanced thermal management and energy conversion applications, and offer new design strategies for the development of thermally functional metamaterials operating in the near-field regime."

When $T_c>0$ the flat band disappears, since it must be modified by the superconducting state. Thus, a number of the results on ultra-strong coupling superconductivity in flat band considered in the article (\"Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry\", Nature 614, 440 (2023)) were predicted and explained many years ago. One has to take into account that at $T_c>0$ the flat band distorts, becoming tilted. As a result, the charge carriers' velocity $v_F\\propto T_c$ becomes finite, rather than being extremely slow, as it is stated in the article. Thus, the statement \"the charge carriers' group velocity $v_ F$ is extremely slow\" is incorrect and leads the authors to the conceptional misunderstanding, confusing the reader."

We discuss in detail two simplest setups: conventional single-channel spinless interferometer and interferometer formed by helical edge states of two-dimensional topological insulator. We demonstrate that both in the conventional and the helical case the interference dramatically changes the Fano factor and its magnetic field dependence. For weak tunneling coupling, the Fano factor of both setups exhibits a periodic series of sharp AB peaks depending on the magnetic flux piercing the system. Our key finding is that the Fano factor in the helical interferometer provides information about the presence of backscattering defects violating topological protection. In particular, the amplitude of AB peaks in the helical setup is proportional to the strength of the defect in contrast to conventional setup, where peaks have finite amplitude even in the ballistic case."

The mechanism does not involve inelastic scattering and is due to the zero-mode fluctuations in a puddle. We discuss in detail a simple model of a puddle - a cavity in the bulk of the topological insulator. Such a cavity also has helical edge states with tunneling coupling to helical states encompassing the topological insulator. We analyze effect of the edge current in the puddle. Although averaged value of this current is equal to zero, its zero-mode fluctuations act, in the presence of electron-electron interaction, similar to magnetic flux thus allowing backscattering processes, which involve tunneling through the puddle. Rectification of these fluctuations leads to a finite probability of backscattering. This effect is further enhanced due to dephasing process which is also dominated by zero-mode fluctuations. Remarkably, for temperature exceeding level spacing in the puddle, the rate of backscattering does not depend on temperature in a good agreement with recent experiments."

The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete 4x4 block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Fully correlated static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. A special focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem while keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex, as well as the components of the dynamical kernel, acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes."

The asymptotics of these functions are found by using the method of steepest descents and contain additional exponentially suppressed contributions known as hyperasymptotics. These hyperasymptotics are crucially important for the correct matching of wave functions in vicinity of turning points for higher-order differential equations. A quantization condition for bound state energies is obtained, which generalizes the standard Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition for particles with quadratic energy-momentum dispersion and contains non-perturbative in $\\hbar$ correction. This non-perturbative correction, usually associated with tunneling effects or the presence of complex turning points, occurs even for the harmonic potential with quartic dispersion where complex turning points and tunneling are absent. The quantization condition is used to find bound state energies in the case of quadratic and quartic potentials."

Our formulation applies to large-amplitude soliton motion in general superfluids with spin degrees of freedom under arbitrary external potentials. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates , the spin correction could diverge, change the direction of the total force and enable mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic oscallations followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes a transition from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where the particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the symmetry-breaking motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator."

      "summary": "The ground state of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid on a honeycomb lattice is an intriguing many-body state characterized by its topological order and massive entanglement. One of the significant issues is to prepare and manipulate the ground state as well as excited states in a quantum simulator. Here, we provide a protocol to manipulate the Kitaev quantum spin liquid via digital quantum simulation. A series of unitary gates for the protocol is explicitly constructed, showing its circuit depth is an order of O(N) with the number of qubits, N. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol on the IBM Heron r2 processor for N = 8 and 12. We further validate our theoretical framework through numerical simulations, confirming high-fidelity quantum state control for system sizes up to N = 450, and discuss the possible implications of these results."

      "summary": "We explore the ground state phase diagram and nonequilibrium dynamics of genuine two-component particle-imbalanced droplets in both isotropic and anisotropic three-dimensional confinements. A gradual transition from mixed droplet-gas to gas configurations is revealed as the average intercomponent attraction decreases or the transverse confinement becomes tighter. Within the mixed structures, a specific majority fragment binds to the minority droplet, satisfying the density ratio locking condition, while the remaining atoms are in a gas state. Our extended Gross-Pitaevskii numerical results are corroborated by a suitable variational approximation capturing the shape and characteristics of droplet-gas fragments. The tunability of the relatively low gas fraction is showcased through parametric variations of the atom number, the intercomponent imbalance, the trap aspect ratio, or the radius of a box potential. To validate the existence and probe the properties of these exotic phases, we simulate the standard time-of-flight and radio frequency experimental techniques. These allow to dynamically identify the resilience of the droplet fragment and the expansion of the gas fraction. Our results, amenable to current experimental cold atom settings, are expected to guide forthcoming investigations aiming to reveal unseen out-of-equilibrium droplet dynamics."

      "summary": "High entropy materials offer a promising avenue for thermoelectric materials discovery, design, and optimization. However, the large chemical spaces that need to be explored hamper their development. In this work, a large family of high-entropy skutterudites is explored as promising thermoelectric materials. Their potential synthesizability is screened and rationalized using the disordered enthalpy-entropy descriptor through high-throughput density functional theory calculations. In the case of high-entropy skutterudites, the thermodynamic density of states and the entropy gain parameter appear to be key factors for their stabilization. Electronic band structure analyses not only show a reduction in the band gap, which enhances carrier concentration and electrical conductivity, but also a band convergence phenomenon for some specific compositions, which is related to the \"cocktail effect\". Analyzing atom-projected band structures shows how band convergence is due to the simultaneous presence of Fe, Ni, and Co in the compound. The presence of Rh or Ir, while not contributing to this band convergence effect, can be directly linked to an increase in system's entropy, which enhances the thermodynamic stability of these materials. Transport properties are computed for the most promising compositions, and their dynamical, mechanical, and thermal stability are addressed. Our results demonstrates that these types of compounds open new avenues, not only to enhance thermoelectric efficiency but also to reduce costs by utilizing more abundant elements and also improving their durability."

The shift current is evaluated using a real-time approach, where the coupling with an external field is described in terms of a dynamical Berry phase. This methodology incorporates electron-hole interactions and quasiparticle band structure renormalization through an effective Hamiltonian derived from many-body perturbation theory. We find that the shift current is strongly enhanced in correspondence with C excitons. An analysis in terms of the electron-hole pairs reveals that electron and hole are localized on different atoms, and thus, following an optical excitation, the center of the electron charge is displaced, giving rise to a significant photocurrent. Janus TMDs, with their intrinsic out-of-plane asymmetry and tunable electronic properties, are particularly appealing for next-generation optoelectronic and energy-harvesting technologies. These results highlight the role of excitons in the shift-current response of Janus TMDs and demonstrate their potential as promising building blocks for future photovoltaic devices."

Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. These results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and nonlocal entanglement, and they provide a clear path for the study of the relationship between traditional quantum resources and the nonfreeness, in terms of experimentally accessible quantities."

      "summary": "Current studies of non-reciprocal superconducting (SC) transport have centered on the forward-backward asymmetry of the critical current measured along a single axis. In most realizations, this diode effect is achieved via introducing ferromagnetism or applying an external magnetic field, which drives system into an effective Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state but often at the cost of severely suppressing the SC gap and thus compromising device robustness. Here we propose and theoretically demonstrate that coupling a conventional $s$-wave SC thin film to a $d$-wave altermagnet offers a more resilient alternative. The momentum-dependent spin splitting inherent to altermagnets induces a non-collinear SC-diode effect in the BCS state, with the critical-current anisotropy exhibiting a fourfold ($C_4$) symmetry. Upon entering the FF state at large splitting, this anisotropy gradually evolves into a unidirectional ($C_1$) pattern. Crucially, the FF pairing momentum locks to the discrete crystal axes, eliminating the rotational Goldstone mode and preserving a sizable SC gap without any abrupt or significant suppression. These combined features make the altermagnetic proximity an appealing platform to engineer symmetry-protected, energy-efficient and programmable SC diodes for next-generation electronic devices."

The physics of superconductors, represented by both conventional and unconventional superconductors, has been the main topic of high-$T_c$ superconductor physics for over thirty years, revealing some of the properties of high-$T_c$ (or unconventional) superconductors. Scaling relationships lead to the identification of fundamental laws of nature and reveal the essence of superconductor physics. Advances in experimental technology allow us to collect important data, which in turn allow us to make definitive statements about the physical processes underlying strongly correlated Fermi systems. Basing on this observation, we analyze experimental facts that reveal the general scaling properties of both high-$T_c$ and ordinary superconductors, and theoretically explain that the Homes' law $\\rho_{s0}= (1/2\\pi\\lambda_D)^2= T_c\\sigma(T_c)$ is applicable to the both types of superconductors. Here $\\rho_{s0}$ is the superconducting electron density, $\\lambda_D$ is the zero-$T$ penetration depth, $\\sigma$ is the normal state conductivity, $T$ is temperature and $T_c$ is the temperature of superconducting phase transition. Overall, these scaling relationships lead to the identification of fundamental laws of nature and reveal the essence of superconductor physics. All these observations support the theory of fermion condensation. Our theoretical results agree well with a body of diverse and seemingly unrelated experimental facts. They show that the topological fermion condensation quantum phase transition, generating flat bands, is an intrinsic property of strongly correlated Fermi systems and can be considered as a universal agent explaining their basic physics."

We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \\approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\\alpha_h \\approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\\beta_h \\approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape."

However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns, particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information, multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering, automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion, peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully self-driving materials discovery."

Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However, many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its strength $\\beta$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $\\beta$ is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the spacer spins. Increasing this ratio increases the magnitude of $\\beta$ and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up synthesized quantum simulators."

Classical chaos without quantum uncertainty produces computational intractability-trajectories diverge exponentially, yet the system remains on one trajectory, reversible in principle with sufficient precision. Only together do they produce geometric impossibility: chaos exponentially amplifies irreducible $\\hbar$-scale uncertainty until stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution, rendering time-reversed trajectories physically inaccessible despite being mathematically valid and equiprobable. Information is never destroyed-it becomes geometrically inaccessible. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate is identical in both time directions, preserving microscopic symmetry while explaining macroscopic irreversibility. Three decades of Loschmidt echo experiments confirm perturbation-independent decay consistent with geometric inaccessibility. The framework unifies thermodynamic, quantum, and information-theoretic arrows of time."

We directly observe the initial lithiation driven formation of Li2Pt and its evolution to a stable LiPt intermetallic phase during extended cycling via a solid solution type reaction mechanism. Simultaneously, the solid electrolyte interphase transitions from an unstable carbonate rich to a stable LiF dominated composition, confirmed by cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Crucially, cryogenic atom probe tomography reveals spatially distinct compositional regimes within the alloy anode, including lithium flux limited, heterogeneous interfacial zone and a diffusion controlled, homogeneous LiPt alloy bulk. This nanoscale compositional gradient rationalises the emergent solid solution reaction mechanism and highlights how kinetic limitations and interface dynamics govern alloy formation and electrochemical stability. Our findings demonstrate a broadly applicable correlative framework bridging operando structural dynamics with near atomic resolution interfacial chemistry, advancing the rational design of durable alloy electrodes for next generation energy storage."

      "summary": "Simulated annealing provides a heuristic solution to combinatorial optimization problems. The cost function of a problem is mapped onto the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, by using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it unclear how quantum annealing outperforms thermal annealing in which problem instances. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar, but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing."

      "summary": "The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront."

These models generalize the $\\pi$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetries, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The potential quantum speedup in solving optimization problems via adiabatic quantum annealing is often hindered by the closing of the energy gap during the anneal, especially when this gap scales exponentially with system size. In this work, we alleviate this bottleneck by demonstrating that for the NP-complete Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, an informed choice of $n-$local catalysts (operators involving $n$ qubits) can re-open the gap during the annealing process. By analyzing first-order phase transitions in toy instances of the MWIS problem, we first identify direct-tunneling catalysts that effectively eliminate the transition and provide an analytical discussion on when the sign of the catalyst influences its impact. We then reveal that $n-$local catalysts exponentially improve gap scaling and in certain scenarios are as effective as direct tunnel coupling between two minima. Utilizing this understanding, we show that they also increase the efficiency of ground state preparation via adiabatic quantum annealing in random graphs and analytically demonstrate the necessity of their placement across unfrustrated loops in the graph for effective performance in MWIS problems. Additionally, using a circuit implementation of the $n$-local catalyst (requiring $2n$ nearest-neighbour gates), we demonstrate that both the circuit depth and the total number of gates required to solve the problem are reduced by several orders of magnitude when compared to the discrete-time version of traditional quantum annealing using local drivers. Our analysis suggests that non-local quantum fluctuations entangling multiple qubits as a catalyst are key to achieving the desired quantum advantage."

As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal. Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity."

We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems."

For (2+1)-dimensional [(2+1)D] theories, one useful choice is the real projective space $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary sphere of a three-dimensional ball. One-point functions of scalar primary fields on this manifold generally do not vanish and encode the so-called crosscap coefficients. These coefficients also manifest on the sphere as the overlaps between certain crosscap states and CFT primary states. Taking the (2+1)D Ising CFT as a concrete example, we demonstrate that crosscap coefficients can be extracted from microscopic models. We construct crosscap states in both lattice models defined on polyhedrons and continuum models in Landau levels, where the degrees of freedom at antipodal points are entangled in Bell-type states. By computing their overlaps with the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, we obtain results consistent with those from conformal bootstrap. Importantly, our approach directly reveals the absolute values of crosscap overlaps, whereas bootstrap calculations typically yield only their ratios. Furthermore, we investigate the finite-size scaling of these overlaps and their evolution under perturbations away from criticality."

Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators - optical microcavities formed in spherical structures - have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels."

Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery."

We directly observe the temporal evolution of dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes, where heavily damped transmission line modes mediate the interaction. Our frequency-domain measurements confirm the predicted level attraction, while time-domain ring-down measurements reveal the characteristic signatures of dissipative coupling dynamics.

The theory elucidates a site-selective mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer associated with the formation of different Ge-H bonds. When a hydrogen atom approaches a Ge rest-atom, it is strongly accelerated toward the potential minimum forming a transient Ge-H bond and then re-flected by the repulsive wall. This transient bond formation triggers an ultrafast electron transfer event from the rest-atom to an adjacent Ge-adatom, involving several crossings between valence and conduction bands of the substrate. Electronic equilibration is impos-sible within such a short time (Born-Oppenheimer failure) allowing the H-atom kinetic energy to be converted to inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate. H-atom colli-sions at other Ge atoms also form a transient bond but exhibit no electronic excitation, resulting in distinctly less efficient energy loss in scattered H-atoms. The nucle-ar-to-electronic energy transfer observed in this system reflects the electronic dynamics of covalent bond formation at a semiconductor surface, a mechanism that is quite distinct from previously identified nonadiabatic energy transfer mechanisms at metal surfaces mediated by electronic friction or transient negative ions."

These detectors are essential for revealing the spin texture of electronic bands in photoemission experiments. A well-proven approach uses the spin-dependent electron reflection from surfaces influenced by exchange and/or spin-orbit interaction. This paradigmatic study of spin-orbit-influenced MoS 2 samples comprises maps for the spin-dependent reflection asymmetry and the efficiency of spin separation. The results show promising features, which emphasize the potential of TMDC-based spin-polarization detectors. [Phys. Rev. B 112, 235408] Published Thu Dec 04, 2025"

      "summary": "Frustration in spin systems can prevent ordering even at T = 0 , creating quantum spin liquids that have been sought since Anderson’s pioneering work in 1973 and his influential 1987 paper connecting them to high-temperature superconductivity. Kitaev’s solvable spin-1/2 models on a honeycomb lattice brought renewed attention to this field, with Jackeli and Khaliullin later revealing how to engineer Kitaev interactions in real materials. This review highlights theoretical and experimental developments in Kitaev spin liquids, emphasizing leading candidate materials and their broad topological properties such as chiral edge modes. Consequently, it provides essential insights for both experimentalists and theorists working on quantum spin liquid problems. [Rev. Mod. Phys. 97, 045003] Published Wed Dec 03, 2025"
