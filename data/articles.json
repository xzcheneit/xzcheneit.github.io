      "summary": "MRI radiofrequency (RF) coils are ultimately limited by conductor loss, thermal noise, and reciprocity constraints associated with conventional metallic boundary conditions. These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites."

In this paper, the problem of wave energy absorption by floating and submerged piezoelectric plates is investigated. The equations of motion for a plate consisting of two piezoelectric layers separated by an elastic substrate are derived in dimensional form from the full piezoelectric constitutive laws. A novel solution method based on conversion of hypersingular equations to a matrix operator is presented, which is general and can solve the equations of motion for submerged rigid, flexible elastic or flexible piezoelectric plates. Extensive numerical results are given for a range of parameters, including different piezoelectric materials: polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT-5H). Importantly, greater energy absorption is obtained for submerged plates when compared to plates floating on the surface. Furthermore, clamped boundary conditions give slightly larger energy absorption compared to the simply supported case.

The cases of electrically impermeable (insulated) and electrically limited permeable conditions on the crack faces are considered. In the first case a vector Hilbert problem in the complex plane is formulated and solved exactly and in the second one the quadratic equation with respect to the electric flux through the crack region is obtained additionally. Its solution permits to find phonon and phason stresses, displacement jumps (sliding) and also electric characteristics along the material interface. Analytical formulas are also obtained for the corresponding stress intensity factors related to each field. The numerical computations for three selected variants of the loading conditions was conducted and the resulting field distributions are visualised on the crack continuation beyond the crack and also inside of the crack region."

Recent numerical studies in several microscopic models reveal that increasing the bandwidth in an FCI can drive a direct transition into a charge-2e superconductor rather than a conventional Fermi liquid. Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $\\nu = 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes. Our results reveal a rich landscape of exotic superconductors with no normal state Fermi surface and predict novel higher-charge superconductors coexisting with neutral non-Abelian topological order at more general filling fractions $\\nu = p/(2p+1)$."

Using a general tight-binding framework applied to multiple periodic systems, we establish the criteria for the emergence of Klein tunneling based on the conservation of an effective reduced pseudospin. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the wave vector leads to nontrivial matching conditions for wave scattering at interfaces. We further examine the emergence of multiple types of Klein tunneling in two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, including phosphorene and borophene, as well as in one-dimensional systems such as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. Finally, we discuss how these tunneling phenomena can be tested in both synthesized and artificial lattices, including elastic metamaterials, optical, photonic, phononic, and superconducting platforms, demonstrating the universality of Klein tunneling across different wave natures and length scales."

      "summary": "Engineering unconventional superconductors is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Molecule-intercalated TaS2 superlattices have recently been reported to host such states, yet their origin remains debated, underscoring the urgent need for controlled, device-integrated studies. Here, we report that nanometer-thick TaS2 and NbSe2 intercalated with chiral and achiral organic cations instead exhibit robust monolayer-like Ising superconductivity, with no evidence of unconventional pairing. Using high-quality superlattices integrated into devices, we disentangle the roles of interlayer coupling and charge transfer in shaping their superconducting behavior. In TaS2, intercalation induces interlayer decoupling regardless of molecular size or symmetry, yielding monolayer-like Ising superconductivity. NbSe2 instead retains quasi-three-dimensional transport, with a gradual Ising enhancement and near-monolayer behavior only at the largest interlayer spacing. Transport remains reciprocal across all superlattices, consistent with preserved inversion symmetry and incompatible with parity-breaking superconductivity and noncentrosymmetric monolayers. We attribute the behavior to electronically detached monolayers with opposite spin-split bands, coupled through thermal and tunneling processes, which overall preserve inversion symmetry. These findings establish molecular intercalation compounds as a robust, device-ready, platform for engineering advanced superconducting superlattices."

      "summary": "The notoriously low and fluctuating valley splitting is one of the key challenges for electron spin qubits in silicon (Si), limiting the scalability of Si-based quantum processors. In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the \"modulated wiggle well,\" which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $\\mu$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting."

      "summary": "Sb2S3 is a promising material for low-toxicity, high-stability next-generation photovoltaics. Despite high optical limits in efficiency, progress in improving its device performance has been limited by severe voltage losses. Recent spectroscopic investigations suggest that self-trapping occurs in Sb2S3, limiting the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to a maximum of approximately 800 mV, which is the level the field has asymptotically approached. In this work, we surpass this voltage barrier through reductions in the defect density in Sb2S3 thin films by modulating the growth mechanism in chemical bath deposition using citrate ligand additives. Deep level transient spectroscopy identifies two deep traps 0.4-0.7 eV above the valence band maximum, and, through first-principles calculations, we identify these to likely be S vacancies, or Sb on S anti-sites. The concentrations of these traps are lowered by decreasing the grain boundary density from 1114+/-52 nm/um2 to 585+/-10 nm/um2, and we achieve a Voc of 824 mV, the record for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work addresses the debate in the field around whether Sb2S3 is limited by defects or self-trapping, showing that it is possible to improve the performance towards the radiative limit through careful defect engineering."

Here, we introduce a computational framework based on normalizing flows that directly maps solvent configurations between solutes of different sizes, and compare the accuracy and efficiency to conventional free energy estimates. For a Lennard-Jones solvent, we demonstrate that this approach yields acceptable accuracy in estimating free energy differences for challenging transformations, such as solute growth or increased solute-solute separation, which typically demand multiple intermediate simulation steps along the transformation. Analysis of radial distribution functions indicates that the flow generates physically meaningful solvent rearrangements, substantially enhancing configurational overlap between states in configuration space. These results suggest flow-based models as a promising alternative to traditional free energy estimation methods."

      "summary": "A minimal model of ionic aggregation in concentrated ZnCl$_2$ is developed, guided by molecular dynamics simulations with a machine-learned potential. It explicitly incorporates solvent-site depletion, correlated chloride binding, and allows for loops within Zn-Cl clusters. Dehydration is shown to drive ion binding through two sharp transitions set by the Zn coordination number $Z$: a crossover at $Z=2$ from isolated ions to Cl-bridged clusters, and gelation near $Z\\approx 3$. The model agrees quantitatively with MD results, and the critical exponent of the cluster-size distribution matches percolation theory."

      "summary": "High-entropy materials have emerged as a promising class of catalysts, driven by their high configurational entropy originating from structural disorder in single-phase multicomponent systems. Despite their potential, the catalytic performance of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) remains relatively underexplored. In this study, we present a simple solution-based combustion route to synthesize two low-cost, transition metal-rich multicationic oxides positioned in the medium-entropy (HEO-4) and high-entropy (HEO-5) regimes. Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data confirmed single-phase formation with a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure for both nanostructures. The morphology, particle size, and multicationic elemental distribution were investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic performance of the synthesized HEOs was evaluated in the hydrogenation of a series of nitrophenol derivatives. Notably, HEO-5 exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity ($k_{\\mathrm{app}} \\approx 0.5~\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, TOF $= 2.1 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{mol\\,g^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$), achieving rapid conversion of \\emph{p}-nitrophenol compared to the medium-entropy oxide nanostructures ($k_{\\mathrm{app}} \\approx 0.02~\\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, TOF $= 7.2 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{mol\\,g^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$). Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the reaction, including the activation energy ($E_a$), enthalpy of activation ($\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$), Gibbs free energy of activation ($\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$), and entropy of activation ($\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$), were determined to gain mechanistic insight into the reduction process. This study opens new avenues for the rational design and facile synthesis of high-entropy oxide catalysts, highlighting their potential for efficient and sustainable large-scale amine production."

      "summary": "Twistronics, which exploits moire modulation of lattice and electronic structures in twisted bilayers, has emerged as a powerful approach to engineer novel quantum states. Recent efforts have expanded beyond two dimensional van der Waals (vdWs) crystals to more complex, strongly correlated materials, where interfacial moire effects can dominate physical properties. Here we demonstrate a generalizable route to fabricate twisted bilayers of transition metal nitrides with vdWs like interfaces, using freestanding CrN membranes as a model system. Twisted bilayer CrN (tCrN) is realized by employing cubic alkaline earth metal monoxides as sacrificial layers, enabling the assembly of clean, controllable interfaces. Electron ptychography reveals well defined, periodic square moire superlattices in tCrN. For a twist angle of 16.3 degree, we identify a nearly commensurate moire lattice with coincident Cr columns, whereas at 45 degree we uncover localized octagonal quasicrystalline order with clear self-similarity. These results establish a practical platform for twisted TMNs and open avenues to explore moire-induced atomic configurations and emergent correlated phenomena in nitride based heterostructures."

We report the successful synthesis of Ni3InN thin films on substrates with different lattice constants. First-principles phonon calculations confirm the dynamical stability of cubic phase Ni3InN, providing the basis for epitaxial synthesis. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals coherent (001)-oriented interfaces when Ni3InN is grown on LaAlO3 and SrTiO3, while an unexpected (011)-orientation forms on DyScO3, aligning with surface-energy predictions. Transport measurements highlight a strain-controlled Fermi-liquid behavior, correlated with variations in the Ni-3d bandwidth and hybridization. Band structure calculations reveal a dual character near the Fermi level: a high-mobility Dirac-like band and a Ni-3d manifold that drives strange-metal transport with a reduced slope compared to oxide perovskites. The formal Ni valence (+2/3) places Ni3InN in an overdoped correlated-metal regime, distinguishing from most perovskite oxides. This positions antiperovskite nitrides as a promising platform for investigating overdoped Fermi liquids and strange-metal behavior."

      "summary": "Collective quantum phenomena, such as the excitation of composite fermions1, spin waves2, and exciton condensation3,4, can emerge in strongly correlated systems like the fractional quantum Hall states5, spin liquids6, or excitonic insulators7. Two-dimensional (2D) moir\\'e superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring such correlated phases and their associated collective excitations8,9. Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moir\\'e electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moir\\'e superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the electronic crystalline nature of correlated phases, opening avenues for probing and manipulating collective excitations in correlated electron systems."

      "summary": "Material scientists and condensed matter physicists have long been divided on the issue of choosing the conceptual framework for explaining why open-shell transition-metal oxides tend to be insulators, whereas otherwise successful theories such as DFT often predict them to be (false) metals. Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators. This view sheds light on the historic controversy between Mott and Slater that still reverberates today."

      "summary": "Magnetic refrigeration presents an energy-efficient and environmentally benign alternative to traditional vapour-compression cooling technologies. It relies on the magnetocaloric effect, in which the temperature of a magnetic material changes in response to variations in an applied magnetic field. Optimal magnetocaloric materials are characterized by a significant change in magnetic entropy under moderate magnetic field. In this study, we systematically investigated the inter-atomic exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy energy and magnetocaloric properties of MnX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) using a combination of density functional theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra were computed using the all-electron, fully relativistic, full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. The largest Kerr effect observed in MnBi can be inferred as a combined effect of maximal exchange splitting of Mn 3d states and the large spin-orbit coupling of Bi. To extract site-projected spin and orbital moments, spin-orbit coupling and orbital polarization correction are accounted in the present calculation, which shows good agreement between the moment obtained from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism sum rule analysis, spin-polarized calculation, and experimental studies. The magnetic transition temperatures predicted through Monte-Carlo simulations were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. Our results provide a unified microscopic understanding of magnetocaloric performance and magneto-optical activity in Mn-based pnictides and establish a reliable computational framework for designing next-generation magnetic refrigeration materials."

      "summary": "The foundations of irradiation damage theory were laid in the 1950s and 60s within the framework of chemical reaction kinetics. While helpful to analyze qualitative aspects of irradiation damage, the theory contained gaps that delayed its implementation and applicability as a predictive tool. The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters, and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics, each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model, but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes."

      "summary": "First-principles studies were performed on two Mn-based ferrimagnetic Heusler compounds with L21 and B2 structures, that is, Mn2VZ (Z = Al or Ga). The aim was to investigate their magnetic properties, electronic structures, and spin-resolved longitudinal conductivity at finite temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) and functional integral theory were used. This approach incorporates transverse spin fluctuations through a disordered local moment method and the coherent potential approximation. In all cases, the calculated theoretical Curie temperatures were lower than the experimental values. Alloys with a B2 structures exhibit higher Curie temperatures compared to compounds with an L21 structures. Calculations of the temperature dependence of the density of states (DOS) indicate that the half-metallic electronic structure collapses owing to the renormalization of transverse spin fluctuations at a finite temperatures. However, the spin-resolved longitudinal conductivities demonstrated an improved spin polarization, particularly for Mn2VGa with an L21 structure. This result contradicts predictions based on the temperature-dependent DOS. The competition between the metallic transitions, which are caused by a modification of the DOS, and scattering coming from spin-disorder explains this phenomenon. Both of these effects are induced by transverse spin fluctuations. Additionally, the results show that half-metallicity, as defined by the DOS or conductivity, is inconsistent at finite temperatures. Finally, the total energy landscape of the paramagnetic state was calculated using the fixed spin moment method to investigate the strength of the longitudinal spin fluctuations. These results suggest that the alloys may exhibit strong longitudinal spin fluctuations."

Underlying physical mechanisms of such current reversals are not fully understood yet. Predicting their appearance is difficult, in particular for interaction-induced ones that emerge upon changes of the particle density. We here derive conditions on external time-dependent drivings, under which current reversals occur in lattice gases with arbitrary pair interactions. Our derivation is based on particle-hole symmetry and shows that current reversals must emerge if the time-varying driving potential changes sign after a translation in time and/or space. Our treatment includes nonstationary dynamics and time-dependent spatially averaged currents in nonequilibrium steady states. It gives insight also into possible occurrences of current reversals in continuous-space dynamics, which we demonstrate for hardcore interacting particles driven across a periodic potential by a traveling wave."

Our analysis reveals a characteristic evolution of the wave-packet center of mass, which undergoes an initial acceleration, subsequently slows down, and ultimately enters a regime of uniform motion, accompanied throughout by exponential amplification of the wave-packet amplitude. To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the Hatano-Nelson chain. Our results elucidate the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity in generating unconventional transport phenomena, and pave the way for controlling wave dynamics in nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian metamaterials."

The 5-nm-thick a-CFB film is capped with a W layer for comparison. The surface morphology is investigated by using the atomic force microscopy technique. The low roughness of all the surface of the film indicates uniformity, moderate corrosion resistance, and good structural quality. The X-ray diffraction spectra reveal the amorphous nature of the CFB layer, while the W capping is of mixed phase in the experimental thickness regime. In-plane and out-of-plane hysteresis loops obtained from the vibrating sample magnetometry technique show a transition from an upright S to nearly rectangular shape via a completely inverted profile. A self-sustained tilted magnetic anisotropy is stabilized in a seed-free environment based on the direct substrate-to-magnet interaction. The interface anisotropy is estimated to be 0.06 erg/cm2. The complex anisotropic behavior originates from the interplay between interface anisotropy, conventional shape anisotropy, growth-induced anisotropies, and inhomogeneity-induced anisotropies. In essence, effective anisotropy is responsible for the anomalous hysteresis behavior observed in these films, and this work might provide valuable insights to improve the functionalities of amorphous soft magnetic alloys."

      "summary": "Past experimental observations of gas-liquid and gas-crystal coexistence in low-salinity suspensions of highly charged colloids have suggested the existence of like charge attraction. Evidence for this phenomenon was also observed in primitive-model simulations of (asymmetric) electrolytes and of low-charge nanoparticle dispersions. These results from low-valency simulations have often been extrapolated to experimental parameter regimes of high colloid valency where like-charge attraction between colloids has been reported. However, direct simulations of highly charged colloids remain computationally demanding. To circumvent slow equilibration, we employ a machine-learning (ML) framework to construct ML potentials that accurately describe the effective colloid interactions. Our ML potentials enable fast simulations of dispersions and successfully reproduce the gas-liquid and gas-solid phase separation observed in primitive-model simulations at low charge numbers. Extending the ML-based simulations to higher valencies, where primitive-model simulations become prohibitively slow, also reveals like-charge attractions and gas-liquid spinodal instabilities, however only in the regime of strongly coupled electrostatic interactions and not in the weakly coupled Poisson-Boltzmann regime of the experimental observations of colloidal like-charge attractions."

      "summary": "Quasicrystals, structures that are ordered yet aperiodic, defy conventional band theory, confining most studies to finite-size real-space numerics. We overcome this limitation with a configuration-space framework that predicts and explains the positions and origins of energy gaps in quasicrystalline potentials. We find that a hierarchy of gaps stems from resonant hybridization between increasingly distant neighboring sites, pinning the integrated density of states below these gaps to specific irrational areas in configuration space. Large-scale simulations of a lowest-band tight-binding model built from localized Wannier functions show excellent agreement with these predictions. By moving beyond finite-size numerics, this study advances the understanding of quasicrystalline potentials, paving the way for new explorations of their quantum properties in the infinite-size limit."

      "summary": "Plasmons in atomically thin materials offer a compelling route to trigger nonlinear light-matter interactions through extreme optical confinement in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. However, optical nonlocality in plasmons is typically associated with losses in the linear response regime. Here, we show that nonlocal effects mediate strong plasmon-assisted optical nonlinearity in electrically reconfigurable 2D heterostructures. Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics."

      "summary": "In quantum materials, charge orders typically stabilize in specific crystallographic orientations, though their formation mechanisms may vary. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we discover a lattice-decoupled rotatable stripe-like charge order coexisting with superconductivity in 2M-WS2. The charge order manifests five distinct orientations across different sample regions, yet maintains an identical wavelength. This directional decoupling from host lattice challenges existing paradigms. First-principles calculations of phonon spectra and nesting function fail to explain the ordering mechanism. Intriguingly, the transition temperature of the charge orders exhibits spatial variations (21-46 K), coinciding with the temperature range of the recently reported strange metal phase in this material. This correlation suggests that the interplay between strong electronic correlations and electron-phonon coupling must be critically evaluated to elucidate the emergence of this unconventional charge order."

      "summary": "Single-chain elasticity is of fundamental importance in polymer physics, as it underlies many of the unique properties of polymer systems. Recently, there has been interest in characterizing the elastic properties of catenanes, molecular architectures composed of linked molecular rings. To date most studies have focused on the force-extension behavior of polycatenane and catenane dimers. In this study, we employ Monte Carlo computer simulations to investigate the elastic properties of a collection of catenane chains. In addition to polycatenane, we also examine the properties of catenane ribbons constructed by connecting two or three polycatenane chains together with a variable number of side-link rings. After first characterizing the behavior of free polycatenane chains and catenane ribbons, we examine their mechanical response to both an elongational force and a torque applied to the end rings of the chain. We find that the stretching induced by the force is counterbalanced by increasing the torque, which tends to twist the chains and in so doing reduce the extension length. At low torque, the twist angle of the end rings of the chain varies linearly with torque, and the associated torsional spring constant, characterizing the resistance of the chain to twist with the applied torque, tends to increase with stretching force. Relative to polycatenane, ribbons tend to be more elongated at low force and less elongated at strong force. In addition, increasing the ribbon width dramatically increases the torsional stiffness of the chain. Finally, decreasing the degree of side-linking in ribbons tends to decrease slightly the extension length at moderate force and to increase the torsional stiffness for sufficiently large gaps."

Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moir\\'e, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moir\\'e systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moir\\'e systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures."

To overcome challenges associated with defects and sample variance among the tunneling barriers, the methodology of alternating bias assisted annealing (ABAA) was introduced in Pappas et. al[1]. The process of applying alternating bias to the barrier and subsequently aging before use was shown to reduce defects in the barrier. Namely, defects that give rise to two-level systems, coupling to the qubit and expediting decoherence. In this work we replicate an expedited ABAA process through a combination of ab-initio molecular dynamics and machine-learned potentials, illuminating how ABAA effects the energy landscape of the barrier."

While single-molecule (SM) experiments using fluorescent probes have provided critical insight for molecular and polymeric glass formers through rotational measurements, translational dynamics remain largely unexplored in such systems at the molecular length scale. Here, we report SM translational dynamics of molecular probes in high molecular weight polystyrene at three temperatures near Tg. The probes exhibit quasi-stationary position fluctuations, non-Gaussian displacement distributions, sub-diffusive transport with anti-correlated displacements, and a characteristic translational relaxation time. The observations are quantitatively described using a microscopic framework based on the generalized Langevin equation and supported by numerical modeling for heterogeneous transport. The translational dynamics of the probes provides direct microscopic evidence of dynamic heterogeneity and suggests a pathway to more fully understand glassy dynamics in glass formers near Tg."

For $j>1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center."

Although Carbon Black aggregates originate from a presumably isotropic aggregation process, the resulting particles are inherently anisotropic. Therefore, they can be expected to interact with shear flow, which significantly influences material properties. In this study, we investigate sheared suspensions of Carbon Black aggregates to elucidate the impact of aggregate anisotropy on the rheological properties. We aim at concentrations below and above the conductivity percolation threshold and comprehensively characterize particle behavior under flow conditions. Aggregates assembled by a diffusion-limited aggregation process are simulated with Langevin dynamics in simple shear flow. The simulations reveal a clear alignment of the aggregates' long axis with the flow direction, an increase in tumbling frequency with higher shear rates, and a shear-thinning response. This behavior closely parallels that of rod-like particles and underlines the significance of the anisotropic nature of Carbon Black aggregates. These findings will facilitate the optimization of nanocomposite precursor processing and the tailoring of Carbon Black-based conductive suspensions."

      "summary": "Using a combination of band representation analysis, inelastic neutron scattering (INS), magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements, and linear spin wave theory, we establish that the non-coplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological nodal lines, Weyl points, and a three-fold degeneracy in its magnon band structure. The non-coplanar nature of the antiferromagnetic ordering protects the topological magnon nodal lines that transition into Weyl magnons upon the application of specific symmetry-breaking perturbations using an external magnetic field. Zero-field INS measurements confirm the existence of the topological magnon nodal lines through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines, indicating the non-trivial topology of the magnon wavefunctions. This work establishes a clear magnonic analog to Weyl electrons, allowing further exploration of topological behavior in bosonic systems, and highlighting the rich interplay between magnetic order and band topology in non-coplanar antiferromagnets."

      "summary": "Barocaloric (BC) effects at liquid-vapor transitions in hydrofluorocarbons drive most commercial technologies used for heating and cooling in the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning sector. However, these fluids suffer from huge global warming potential and alternative gases are less efficient, toxic or flammable. Solid-solid and solid-liquid BC materials have zero global warming potential and could even improve on current device efficiencies. Whilst solid-liquid BCs typically outperform solid-solid BCs, the latter are advantageous as they avoid leaks and present easier handling and recyclability thus facilitating waste management. Here we confine the solid-liquid BC stearic acid inside the nanopores of a functionalised metal-organic framework (MOF) and demonstrate that the colossal BC properties are retained in a solid-state material. Moreover, the enhanced interactions between the pore surface and the BC material allow a level of active control over the thermal response, as opposed to passive encapsulation. Our results open novel avenues to exploit and tune colossal BC effects in a wide range of combinations of solid-liquid BC materials embedded within functionalized MOFs, without the associated engineering drawbacks."

Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures."

Yet, both have so far been proposed as the processes driving the condensation in nanometric confinements, leading to a long-standing and overlooked ambiguity. Here, we delineate the dichotomy between these mechanisms and test their validity using an experimental method capable of absolute distance measurement during capillary condensation. We show that the molecular content of the capillary meniscus given by the first nucleation theorem is far smaller than what the confinement geometry and the Kelvin equation require. In contrast, the analysis based on film coalescence reproduces the experimental observations and describes the final meniscus formation as a barrierless process, while allowing for an intermediate, first-order-like film-thickening transition prior to the meniscus formation."

A natural question arises: Do polymers in a suspension of active swimmers enhance chaotic motion or promote orientational order? We address this issue by performing lattice Boltzmann simulations of squirmer suspensions in polymer solutions. At intermediate swimmer volume fractions, comparing to the Newtonian counterpart, polymers enhance polarization by up to a factor of 26 for neutral squirmers and 5 for pullers, thereby notably increasing orientational order. This effect arises from hydrodynamic feedback mechanism: squirmers stretch and align polymers, which in turn reinforce swimmer orientation and enhance polarization via hydrodynamic and steric interactions. The mechanism is validated by a positive correlation between polarization and a defined polymer-swimmer alignment parameter. Our findings establish a framework for understanding collective motion in complex fluids and suggest strategies for controlling active systems via polymer-mediated interactions."

      "summary": "Unambiguously identifying unconventional magnetic orders requires probes that are directly sensitive to their momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order. Using realistic parameter estimates for experimentally accessible heterostructures, we demonstrate that these signatures are well within measurable ranges, establishing Zeeman quantum geometry as a powerful and general framework for characterizing unconventional magnetic insulators via their gyrotropic transport responses."

Analyzing the pair amplitude at the [100] edge, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pairing is induced in the presence of zero-energy flat bands, while even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity remains.

By the cooperation of spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential and the $p$-wave unconventional magnetic order, the current phase relation shows the $\\varphi$-junction in the high-transparency but also the temperature dependence of the Josephson current caused by the coupling of the spin-singlet even-parity pairings in the low-transparency limit, even though $p$-wave superconductivity is mainly realized both in the bulk and at the edge.

These changes may arise naturally or result from human interventions; in the latter case, lockdown measures that lead to abrupt but temporary reductions in transmission rates are used to combat disease spread. However, the impact of these measures on rare events in realistic populations has not been studied so far. Here, we analyze the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model in a stochastic setting where disease extinction -- a sudden clearance of the infection -- occurs via a rare, large fluctuation. We use a semiclassical approximation and extensive numerical simulations to show how the extinction risk of the disease depends on both the duration and magnitude of the lockdown, in heterogeneous assortative networks, with degree-degree correlations between neighboring nodes."

Using half-Heusler (hH) materials as an example, this work is aimed at first highlighting these errors and inconsistencies which cannot be filtered with conventional dataset curation workflows. We then propose a statistical round-robin error-based data filtering method to address these issues, a method that can be applied to filter any other material property.

Using \\emph{ab-initio} calculations and enhanced-sampling machine-learning potential molecular dynamics, we show that monolayer-confined water exhibits a markedly lower barrier to auto-dissociation than bulk water. Confinement restructures both intramolecular bonding and the intermolecular hydrogen-bond network, while enforcing quasi-2D dipolar correlations that amplify dielectric fluctuations. Our results imply that two-dimensional confined water could act as a \\emph{superdielectric} medium and may exhibit \\emph{superionic} behavior, as observed in recent experiments. These findings reveal confinement as a powerful route to enhanced proton activity, shedding light on geochemical niches, biomolecular environments, and nanofluidic systems where water's chemistry is fundamentally reshaped."

      "summary": "Sandpiles form one of the largest class of models displaying a critical stationary state. Despite a few decades of research, a comprehensive and systematic rigorous characterisation of their spatial and, even more, time dependent properties has remained elusive. Among the obstacles, we can mention their out of equilibrium and non-linear dynamics features which prevent, in general, the access to the stationary properties explicitly. In fact, even the knowledge of the stationary state is quite exceptional in sandpiles. In that respect, it has become standard to develop a model to model strategy and, so to say, general results or tools applicable to these systems are missing. In this paper, we unveil general and simple properties of time transport correlations in certain classes of abelian sandpile models. We proceed gradually, starting from results applicable in a broad context, to more and more specific ones, consequently valid to smaller and smaller classes. For instance, we show, under a few hypothesis, that the number of particles dissipated displays mostly anticorrelation in time. Besides, on a more integrable point of view, the approach followed might culminate with the proof of a link between 2-points time transport correlations and the second moment of the integrated transport over time. To be clear, these two quantities are related through a linear system of equations which is explicitly solved and applies to at least three 1D sandpile models, namely the Directed Stochastic Sandpile, the Oslo and the Activated Random Walk (in a peculiar setup) models."

To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon, i.e., Schottky-like specific-heat anomalies in frustrated systems. These results clarify the nature of phases and phase transitions in frustrated Ising systems and their exponents, and additionally provide inspiration for experimental efforts to search for the spiral state and Schottky-like anomalies."

      "summary": "Nonreciprocal active matter systems typically feature an asymmetric role among interacting agents, such as a pursuer-evader relationship. We propose a multi-species nonreciprocal active matter model that is invariant under permutations of the particle species. The nonreciprocal, yet symmetric, interactions emerge from a constant phase shift in the velocity alignment interactions, rather than from an asymmetric coupling matrix. This system possessing permutation symmetry displays rich collective behaviors, including a species-mixed chiral phase with quasi-long-range polar order and a species separation phase characterized by vortex cells. The system also displays a coexistence phase of the chiral and the species separation phases, in which intriguing dynamic patterns emerge. These rich collective behaviors are a consequence of the interplay between nonreciprocity and permutation symmetry."

      "summary": "Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) is a powerful approach for investigating various ultrafast phenomena in materials. However, most existing RT-TDDFT studies rely on adiabatic local or semi-local approximations, which suffer from several shortcomings, including the inability to accurately capture excitonic effects in periodic systems. Combining RT-TDDFT with range-separated hybrid (RSH) functionals has emerged as an effective strategy to overcome these limitations. The RT-TDDFT-RSH implementation for periodic systems requires careful treatment of the Coulomb singularity and choosing proper gauges for the incorporation of external fields. We benchmark two schemes for treating the Coulomb singularity - the truncated Coulomb potential and the auxiliary-function correction - and find that the latter shows better convergence behavior and numerical stability for long-range corrected hybrid functions. Additionally, we assess the impact of gauge choice in simulations using numerical atomic orbitals and show that the recently proposed hybrid gauge incorporating position-dependent phases provides a more accurate description of excitonic absorption than the conventional velocity gauge. Our implementation significantly improves the accuracy of RT-TDDFT-RSH for modeling ultrafast excitonic dynamics in periodic systems."

This system is characterized by a constant phase shift $\\alpha$ in the inter-species velocity alignment rule. While the phase shift renders the interaction nonreciprocal, the system is globally invariant under any permutations of particle species, possessing Potts symmetry. The combination of Potts symmetry and nonreciprocity gives rise to a rich phase diagram. The nonreciprocal phase shift generates either counter-clockwise or clockwise chirality. Potts symmetry can be broken spontaneously. Consequently, the system exhibits four distinct phases: A species-mixed chiral phase where particles perform counter-clockwise chiral motion with quasi-long-range order, a species separation phase where Potts symmetry is broken and species-separated particles form vortex cells with clockwise chirality, a coexistence phase, and a disordered phase. We derive a Boltzmann equation and a hydrodynamic equation describing the system in the continuum limit, and present analytic arguments for the emergence of chirality and species separation."

      "summary": "While phonon topology in crystalline solids has been extensively studied, its influence on thermal transport-especially in nanostructures-remains elusive. Here, by combining first-principles-based machine learning potentials with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the role of topological surface phonons in the in-plane thermal transport of semiconductor thin films (Si, 4H -SiC, and c-BN). These topological surface phonons, originating from nontrivial acoustic phonon nodal lines, not only serve as key scattering channels for dominant acoustic phonons but also contribute substantially to the overall thermal conductivity. Remarkably, for these thin semiconductor films below 10 nm this contribution can be as large as over 30% of the in-plane thermal conductivity at 300 K, and the largest absolute contribution can reach 82 W/m-K, highlighting their significant role in nanoscale thermal transport in semiconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both temperature and biaxial strain provide effective means to modulate this contribution. Our work establishes a direct link between topological surface phonons and nanoscale thermal transport, offering the first quantitative assessment of their role and paving the way for topology-enabled thermal management in semiconductors."

      "summary": "Blisters, delaminated regions that form in multilayered structures under compressive stresses, are observed across a wide range of length scales, from two-dimensional materials to protective coatings and laminated composites. Far from being passive defects, such interfacial features have emerged as functional motifs for three-dimensional architectures and reconfigurable surfaces. Here we reveal an unusual peel response of a blistered thin film on a soft substrate. When peeled from one end, the advancing peel front triggers reattachment at the blister edge once a critical separation is reached, initiating spontaneous rolling of the film on the substrate. This peel-to-roll transition produces a sharp drop in the measured adhesion force, which then remains constant throughout the rolling phase. Using experiments, scaling analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations, we resolve the contact morphology at the transition and identify the contact length at which rolling initiates. We show that this length arises from interactions between the two contact edges and is independent of the work of adhesion. Once rolling begins, a dynamically imposed dwell time - defined by the rolling length and peel speed - translates contact history into spatial variations in adhesion force, thereby governing the magnitude of the force drop. Together, these results point to a new pathway for generating spatially tunable, heterogeneous adhesion from otherwise homogeneous interfaces."

      "summary": "In many ways the solution to the Hedin equations represents an exact solution to the many body problem. However, for most systems of practical interest, the solution to the Hedin equations is rendered nearly numerically intractable because the Hedin equations are of functional derivative form. Integral equations are much more numerically tractable, than functional derivative equations, as they can often be solved iteratively. In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams."

They exhibit strong type-II bulk superconductivity with moderate superconducting transition temperatures and upper critical fields.

In the absence of static magnetic order, the spin excitation spectrum constitutes the crucial probe of QSL behavior, but its theoretical computation remains a serious challenge. Here we employ state-of-the-art tensor-network methods to obtain the full dynamical spectral function of the $J_1$-$J_2$ kagome Heisenberg model and benchmark our results by tracking their evolution across the magnetically ordered and QSL phases. Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials."

By applying a general criticality condition, we show that each instability can give rise to a critical point by fine-tuning only two parameters. We identify four previously unreported critical points of the Toner-Tu model, two of which already display nonequilibrium critical behavior that extends beyond known universality classes at the linear level. We further construct explicit hydrodynamic models that realize each newly identified critical point, establishing their physical attainability and providing concrete targets for future renormalization-group analyses and microscopic model studies. Altogether, our framework offers a unified theoretical foundation and a practical roadmap for the systematic discovery of new universality classes in active matter."

This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the field dependent adsorption behavior of neutral saccharin and its deprotonated anion (saccharinate) on nickel. By employing the B3LYP functional and implicit solvent models, the field dependent adsorption energetics, frontier orbitals and electrostatic potentials are calculated on a nickel surface. Key findings reveal that while saccharinate dominates in bulk plating baths, its strong solvation shell impedes surface adsorption. In contrast, neutral saccharin exhibits energetically favorable adsorption via sulfonyl oxygen or aromatic $\\pi$-face interactions, with specific orientations further stabilized by the interfacial field.This selective adsorption at growth sites rationalizes saccharin's role in inhibiting rapid crystallization, promoting grain refinement, and producing bright, level deposits.The results directly link field-modulated molecular stereochemistry to macroscopic coating properties, providing a mechanistic foundation for the rational design of electroplating additives beyond empirical approaches."

Combining a systematic mean-field bifurcation analysis with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions, we map the model's dynamical regimes and transitions. Mean-field theory predicts a rich phase structure -- disorder, a time-dependent 'swap' (limit-cycle) phase, and static ordered states -- separated by Hopf, saddle-node on invariant circle, saddle-node of limit cycles, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations. In two dimensions, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that spiral defects destabilise global swapping and, unless vacancies are strongly favoured, destroy long-range order. Crucially, a finite single-ion anisotropy $\\Delta_\\alpha = - \\Delta_\\beta$ promotes vacancy occupation in the $\\alpha$ species and suppresses nonreciprocal dynamics, thereby restoring a robust static ordered phase. Finite-size scaling of susceptibility and Binder cumulants places the disorder to static transition firmly in the 2D Ising universality class. Moreover, within the static ordered phase, we observe a crossover that sharpens into a line of first-order phase transitions; these two regimes are separated by a critical point, analogous to the termination of the liquid-gas coexistence curve. In three dimensions, simulations largely mirror mean-field expectations, though swap to static ordering occurs indirectly via a disordered regime. Our results demonstrate that vacancy energetics provide a simple, experimentally relevant control knob that stabilises equilibrium-like order in nonreciprocal systems and that defects can generate novel critical behaviour."

The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components."

Yet, a large fraction of reported KTaO3-based 2DEGs has been realized through chemically complex overlayers that both generate carriers and can obscure the native electronic structure, making spectroscopic access to the underlying 2DEG challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple and direct method to generate a superconducting 2DEG on KTaO3(111) using Mg-induced surface reduction in molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Mg has an extremely low sticking coefficient at elevated temperatures, enabling the formation of an ultrathin (less than 1-2 monolayers) MgO layer that is transparent to soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows direct measurement of the surface chemistry and low-energy electronic structure of the pristine reduced surface without the need for a several-nanometer-thick capping layer. XPS shows clear reduction of Ta5+ to lower oxidation states, while ARPES reveals a parabolic Ta 5d conduction band with an approximately 150 meV bandwidth and additional subband features arising from quantum confinement. Transport measurements confirm a superconducting transition below 0.6 K. Together, these results demonstrate a chemically straightforward and controllable pathway for fabricating spectroscopically accessible superconducting 2DEGs on KTaO3(111), and provide a powerful new platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying orientation-dependent superconductivity in KTaO3-based oxide interfaces."

Therefore, we explore the conditions for the competition and/or coexistence between both types of superconducting phases, and we identify the presence of the so-called \"topological repulsion\" mechanism, which was previously reported in the context of simple Weyl semimetals. We identified the critical temperatures corresponding to the monopole and conventional superconducting phases, and calculated the specific heat as a function of temperature, thus showing that this thermodynamical parameter may provide an experimental probe to determine the chirality index $\\nu$ in the material."

      "summary": "We introduce replica Markov processes to derive thermodynamic trade-off relations for nonlinear functions of probability distributions. In conventional thermodynamic trade-off relations, the quantities of interest are linear in the underlying probability distribution. Some important information-theoretic quantities, such as R\\'enyi entropies, are nonlinear; however, such nonlinearities are generally more difficult to handle. Inspired by replica techniques used in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we construct Markovian dynamics of identical replicas and derive a lower bound on relative moments in terms of the dynamical activity. We apply our general result to two scenarios. First, for a random walker on a network, we derive an upper bound on the R\\'enyi entropy of the position distribution of the walker, which quantifies the extent of diffusion on the network. Remarkably, the bound is expressed solely in terms of escape rate from the initial node, and thus depends only on local information. Second, we consider trajectory observables in Markov processes and obtain an upper bound on the R\\'enyi entropy of the distribution of these observables, again in terms of the dynamical activity. This provides an entropic characterization of uncertainty that generalizes existing variance-based thermodynamic uncertainty relations."

X-ray diffraction, magnetic, and transport measurements reveal an intrinsic correlation between Fe content, structural ordering, and magnetic ground states. With increasing $x$, the system undergoes a successive transition from paramagnetism to a spin-glass state, then to long-range antiferromagnetism (AFM), and ultimately to a reentrant spin-glass phase, with the transition temperatures exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on Fe content. The maximum N\\'eel temperature ($T_{\\mathrm{N}}$ = $\\mathrm{175K}$) and strongest AFM coupling occur at $x=0.25$, where Fe atoms form a well-ordered $2a_0 \\times 2a_0 $ superlattice within van der Waals gaps. Beyond $x = 0.25$, the superlattice transforms or disorders, weakening Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions and reducing $T_{\\mathrm{N}}$ significantly. Electrical transport exhibits distinct anomalies at magnetic transition temperatures, corroborating the magnetic state evolution. Our work extends the compositional boundary of Fe-intercalated $\\mathrm{NbSe_2}$, establishes precise stoichiometry-structure-magnetism correlations, and identifies structural ordering as a key tuning parameter for AFM. These findings provide a quantitative framework for engineering altermagnetic or switchable antiferromagnetic states in van der Waals materials."

Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks.

We observe an enhanced diode effect when a top gate depletes the 2DEG in the region of the hole arrays, while preserving the overall supercurrent. Theoretical analysis shows that the physics behind this phenomenon is the increased difference of transparency between different bands in the junction. These results highlight a new pathway for engineering and controlling nonreciprocal superconducting transport in hybrid systems."

Recently, the observation of charge transfer and interfacial polarons in superconducting interface has aroused extensive research interest. However, experimental data to investigate charge transfer on the CuO2 plane and the presence of polarons are still missing. Here we conduct extensive research on the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional material supported on copper-based superconductors. Unlike monolayer-WSe2 on other substrates, monolayer-WSe2 on La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (WSe2/LSCO) produces a special band structure. Using high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry and density functional theory calculation methods, the special electronic structure can be attributed to the formation of the interfacial small polaron at the WSe2/LSCO interface which is driven by charge transfer between the CuO2 plane of the cuprate superconductor and WSe2. In addition, the structural phase transition of the LSCO substrate was observed to reduce the electron-hole (e-h) interaction of WSe2. These findings may spur future investigations on the effect of the interfacial polaron on the superconductivity of cuprates, and highlight the significant influence of interface effects on the electronic structure of WSe2 films. It provides an effective method to further explore the intrinsic relationship between interfacial polarons and superconductivity."

KTaO_3-based heterostructures uniquely host both interfacial two-dimensional superconductivity and a quantum paraelectric lattice background. The coupling between these two degrees of freedom potentially provides a promising route to encode memory directly into the superconducting state. Here, we reveal two intertwined phenomena in AlO_x/KTaO_3 heterostructures: a gate-history memory in which progressive electrostatic cycling enhances the superconducting transition temperature, and its complete erasure by light illumination at cryogenic temperatures. These phenomena arise from a previously unrecognized interplay between the superconducting interface and emergent lattice excitations - including polar-nanoregion reorientation and oxygen-vacancy ionization. These results demonstrate reconfigurable and non-volatile superconductivity at correlated oxide interfaces, opening a pathway to combine dissipationless transport with non-volatility for superconducting neuromorphic elements."

The time-resolved detection scheme eliminates the large nonlinear current generated by the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect, allowing exclusive observation of a long-lived anomalous Hall conductivity of photocarriers that depends on the helicity of NIR light. The magnitude of this conductivity is comparable to that of GaAs despite silicon's much weaker spin-orbit coupling, and its robustness against NIR photon energy rules out a spin-polarization-based origin, which occurs only in the vicinity of the bandgap. These results suggest the emergence of the inverse orbital Hall effect, paving the way for silicon-based orbitronics."

In addition, thermodynamic anomalies ($T_{\\rm A}$ and $H_{\\rm A}$) occur in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat at intermediate fields (6--10 T) along the [111] direction. Furthermore, a nontrivial fifth-order nonlinear susceptibility is observed in the normal-state magnetization of UBe$_{13}$.

The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the \"roton minimum\" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice."

The resulting diagrams reveal three regimes: a completely extended phase, a completely localized phase, and a mixed domain where localized and extended states coexist. In the diagrams, we investigate the behaviors of tightly and loosely wound helices and examine a special case where the number of sites per turn is a Fibonacci number. For moderate numbers of sites per helical turn, the mixed region is broad and also shifts with the long-range coupling. When the turn size is a Fibonacci number, the phase boundary becomes nearly horizontal and the mixed region fades out, effectively recovering the standard Aubry-Andr\\'e model behavior."

We identify boundaries separating extended, mixed, and localized regimes by constructing a diagram incorporating potential strength and inter-ring coupling. In the metallic regime, persistent currents flowing around both the toroidal and poloidal directions show oscillations whose amplitude decays as disorder grows and vanishes past the localization threshold; in the localized regime, currents become flux-insensitive. We demonstrate that tuning magnetic fluxes, hopping strengths, or quasiperiodic potential amplitudes provides control over the critical disorder threshold.

The multi-scale distances and energy barriers between minima are characterized by two metrics, both of which exhibit signatures of an ultrametric space. The scale-free distribution of energy barriers reveals that the landscape is hierarchical."

      "summary": "Skyrmions are highly stable chiral magnetic spin textures with non-trivial topology. They can act as quasi-particles that can be generated, manipulated and annihilated, and hold promise for future memory and logic devices. As of now, all-optical stochastic nucleation of skyrmion ensembles, mostly in small applied magnetic fields, has been shown. However, to research their true potential, the ability to selectively toggle switch individual single skyrmions would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we demonstrate the field-free optical control of single stable skyrmions via single femtosecond laser pulses with diameters down to 175 nm, containing a fixed chirality. By engineering ferrimagnetic Co/Gd-based multilayers, we resolve the competition between deterministic and stochastic processes, and thereby overcome the challenge of optically writing and annihilating sub-micron skyrmions on demand. Our work is envisioned to fuel applications of skyrmion-based applications and opens up further endeavors in research related to the behaviour of more complicated skyrmion-based textures."

      "summary": "Nanocellular polyetherimide exhibits significant improvements in mechanical properties like toughness and impact resistance, commonly associated with the presence of nanoporosity. However, this work demonstrates these enhancements, often measured directly after processing, cannot be fully explained solely by the cellular structure but also originate from a modification of the polymer matrix induced by the CO2-saturation process. Through a systematic study involving thermal treatments and saturation-desorption processes without foaming, it is shown that CO2 exposure, even in the absence of pore formation, induces an apparent rejuvenation of the polymer, as evidenced by a reduction in the yield stress, which persists after complete CO2 desorption and in the absence of residual gas during mechanical testing. Therefore, the observed ductile response is not associated with the presence of CO2 during deformation, but with a permanent modification of the polymer matrix induced by prior gas exposure. This structural state can be thermally reversed by activating the beta relaxation of the polymer. For nanocellular polymers, the presence of residual gas within the matrix during foaming restricts thermal relaxation and helps preserve the CO2-modified state. As a result, the mechanical response of the solid phase reflects the intrinsic properties of the saturated polymer and the architecture imposed by the cellular structure. This work demonstrates for the first time that CO2 saturation can permanently alter the mechanical state of a high-Tg amorphous polymer, providing a new framework to interpret the brittle-to-ductile transition in nanocellular PEI."

      "summary": "We investigate a 2D dynamical absorbing state model of monodisperse disks, in which rich phase behavior arises from interactions consisting solely of repulsive displacements between overlapping particles. The phase diagram reveals several unconventional features, including a disordered and static absorbing configuration, where no particles overlap, separated by a second-order phase transition to a continuously evolving active hexagonal crystal with collective ring diffusion, which in turn undergoes a first-order phase transition to an active isotropic liquid. The only driving parameter is $\\epsilon$, the maximum size of the random repulsive kicks. Small $\\epsilon$ facilitates self-organization into an ordered state, but large $\\epsilon$ prevents this organization from occurring. This is very different from typical order-disorder transitions, where there are two competing influences, energy and entropy, that drive the transition."

      "summary": "The possibility of a zero temperature, altermagnetic instability in anisotropic two dimensional electron systems in the diffusive regime is analyzed, in the presence and absence of spin-orbit coupling. Allowing for ferromagnetism, a phase diagram is built as a function of the parameter that controls anisotropy and the strength of the interactions. It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears. The phase transition from the paramagnetic to the magnetically ordered phases is of second order, while the phase transition between ferromagnet and altermagnet states is first order. The altermagnetic phase is robust under small magnetic fields, displaying a coexistence with a field-induced magnetization."

Working with non-interacting, spinless fermions, we solve the model via exact diagonalization on large Fibonacci sizes and diagnose phases using inverse/normalized participation ratios and the correlation fractal dimension. We identify boundaries separating extended, multifractal (mixed), and localized regimes by constructing a phase diagram in the plane of modulation strength and dimerization ratio. As the quasiperiodic amplitude is increased, the system exhibits reentrant behavior, localizing, partially re-delocalizing into a multifractal regime, and re-localizing, verified via two-size crossings of band-averaged observables and finite-size scaling. We demonstrate that tuning the modulation strength, the SSH dimerization, or the incommensurability parameter provides control over the critical thresholds. Our results suggest a versatile, randomness-free platform for the deterministic control of transport, enabling switching between conducting, multifractal, and insulating states."

      "summary": "Condensed matter physics is often concerned with determining the response of a solid to an external stimulus. This paper revisits and extends the microscopic formalism for calculating response coefficients -- here referred to as (generalized) polarizabilities -- in crystalline electronic insulators. The main focus is on the Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization, for which we obtain general formulas describing the linear response to an arbitrary (but static and uniform) perturbation. The response of an arbitrary lattice-periodic observable (e.g. spin, layer pseudospin) to electric and magnetic fields is also examined, and serves as a basis for mircoscopically establishing Maxwell relations between conjugate generalized polarizabilities. We furthermore introduce and examine the notion of Berry curvature or Hall vector polarizability, i.e., the response of the Berry curvature to a general perturbation, and show how it relates to Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization responses. For all polarizabilities considered, we obtain simplified formulas applicable to two- and four-band models, expressed directly in terms of the Hamiltonian and the perturbation. Three specific applications of these formulas are discussed: (i) a computation of the magnetoelectric polarizabilities of model antiferromagnets in one and two dimensions; (ii) a general proof of (quasi)topological signatures in the polarizabilities of Dirac fermions in two dimensions; (iii) a calculation of the strain-induced Berry curvature polarizability in an altermagnet."

      "summary": "More than a century after discovery, the theory of conventional superconductivity remains incomplete. While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential \\mu*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design."

Structural optimization of the trees based on time evolution of the entanglement in the system allows to keep the necessary bond dimensions low and to maximally exploit the increased expressiveness of TTNs over MPS. In this way, we achieve more accurate results in all considered parameter regimes both below and above the ergodicity-to-localization crossover at a comparable compute-time cost."

Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications."

We summarize the numerical results for the binary system before employing linear stability analysis on the coarse-grained system. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and particle simulations, and our kinetic theory is able to capture the correct lengthscale in the emergent coexistence phases through a Turing-Hopf instability. Extending the kinetic framework to multi-species systems with cyclic alignment interactions, we recover precisely the same emergent ordering as corresponding simulations of the microscopic model. More generally, our kinetic theory provides an extensible framework for analyzing pattern formation and collective order in multi-species active matter systems."

      "summary": "Measurement of the Hall effect is a ubiquitous probe for materials discovery, characterization, and metrology. Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals. These methods are generic and can be applied to any conductor."

      "summary": "We present a theory of resonance fluorescence (RF) of a solid-state quantum emitter in the regime of weak optical excitation. The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions."

      "summary": "Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs."

      "summary": "Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a temperature-responsive polymer that undergoes large volumetric deformations through a transition from a swollen to a collapsed state at the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT). Locally, these deformations stem from the coil-to-globule transition of individual chains. In this contribution, I revisit the study of Suzuki and Ishii (\"Phase coexistence of neutral polymer gels under mechanical constraint\"), which demonstrated that a PNIPAM rod can exhibit phase coexistence (i.e. comprise swollen and collapsed domains) near the VPTT when subjected to mechanical constraints. Specifically, that paper showed that (1) collapsed domains gradually form in a fixed swollen rod with time and (2) swollen domains can nucleate in a collapsed rod that under uniaxial extension. These behaviors originate from the local thermo-mechanical response of the chains, which transition between states in response to the applied mechanical loading. Here, I develop a statistical-mechanics based framework that captures the behavior of individual chains below and above the VPTT and propose a probabilistic model based on the local chain response that sheds light on the underlying mechanisms governing phase nucleation and growth. The model is validated through comparison with experimental data. The findings from this work suggest that in addition to the classical approaches, in which the VPTT is programmed through chemical composition and network topology, the transition can be tuned by mechanical constraints. Furthermore, the proposed framework offers a pathway to actively tailor the VPTT through the exertion of mechanical forces, enabling improved control and performance of PNIPAM hydrogels in modern applications."

      "summary": "Hole-spin qubits enable fast, all-electrical spin manipulation through electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), arising from two microscopic mechanisms rooted in their intrinsically strong spin-orbit interaction. Depending on how the electric field acts on the quantum dot, the spin can be driven either by a modulation of its g-factor or by a displacement of the wavefunction. Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance."

These efforts aim to understand and enhance the spin spin interactions in 2D. An emergent class of such magnets is the layered FeNGeTe2 (N = 3, 4, and 5). Here, we investigate the magnetic states over a wide field temperature phase space in the high-Tc ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using magnetization, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and magneto-transport measurements. Our findings reveal a magnetic phase transition from a collinear to a complex non-collinear magnetic order near the temperature T* = 160 K, below which magnetic susceptibility is reduced, FMR linewidth broadened, and anomalous Hall resistivity suppressed. Such non-collinearity results from the competition between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction arising from the unusual Fe1 ordering in two possible split sites. Our study focuses on the strategy to quench the non-collinear spin order. Substituting 40% Ni in Fe5GeTe2 is found to be one such quenching strategy. This provides deeper insights into the magnetism of a high-Tc layered-ferromagnet, offering opportunities to develop 2D magnet-based devices."

At room temperature, uniaxial tensile strain increases the resistivity tensor components by a comparable magnitude both parallel and perpendicular to the strain axis. In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K. The occurrence of such a phase is associated with the transition of the CDW into the commensurate state along the tensile strain direction while maintaining nearly commensurability along the perpendicular one. The results allow to justify various models widely used in analysis of transport properties of 1T-TaS$_2$ in commensurate and nearly commensurate states."

We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light.

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\\it within} the $\\gamma$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system."

      "summary": "This study aims to evaluate the optoelectronic properties of metal free porphyrin-based D-$\\pi$-A dyes via in-silico performance investigation notifying energy informatics and decision support. To develop novel organic dyes, three acceptor/anchoring groups and five donating groups were introduced to strategic positions of the base porphyrin structure, resulting in a total of fifteen dyes. The singlet ground state geometries of the dyes were optimized utilizing density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP and the excited state optical properties were explored through time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) using the PCM model with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent. Both DFT and TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The HOMO energy levels of almost all the modified dyes are lower than the redox potential of I$^-$/I$3^-$ and LUMO energy levels are higher than the conduction band of TiO$2$. The absorption maxima values ranged from 690.64 to 975.55 nm. The dye N1 using triphenylamine group as donor and p-ethynylbenzoic acid group as acceptor, showed optimum optoelectronic properties ($\\Delta G{reg}=-9.73$ eV, $\\Delta G{inj}=7.18$ eV, $V_{OC}=1.47$ V and $J_{SC}=15.03$ mA/cm$^2$) with highest PCE 14.37%, making it the best studied dye. This newly modified organic dye with enhanced PCE is remarkably effective for the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) industry. Beyond materials discovery, this study highlights the role of high-performance computing in enabling predictive screening of dye candidates and generating performance indicators (HOMO-LUMO gaps, absorption spectra, charge transfer free energies, photovoltaic metrics). These outputs can serve as key parameters for energy informatics and system modelling."

While both molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and sputter deposited Sc0.3Al0.7N films show Sc clustering, the degree of clustering is significantly stronger for the MBE-grown film, offering an explanation for some of the discrepancies between MBE-grown and sputtered films reported in the literature. Moreover, the MBE-grown Sc0.3Al0.7N film exhibits a dispersive and anomalously large dielectric permittivity, roughly double that of sputtered Sc0.3Al0.7N. We attribute this result to the Sc-rich clusters locally reaching x ~ 0.5 and approaching the predicted ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition, resulting in a giant (local) enhancement in permittivity. The Sc-rich clusters should similarly affect the piezoelectric, optical, and ferroelectric responses, suggesting cluster-engineering as a means to tailor ScAlNs functional properties."

      "summary": "Chemical and biological networks can describe a wide variety of processes, from gene regulatory networks to biochemical oscillations. Modeled by chemical master equations, these processes are inherently stochastic, as fluctuations dominate deterministic order at mesoscopic scales. These classic many-body processes suffer from the so-called curse of high dimensionality, which makes exact mathematical descriptions exponentially expensive to compute. The exponential cost renders the study of the thermodynamic properties of such systems out of equilibrium intractable and forces approximations of system noise or assumptions of continuous particle numbers. Here, we use tensor networks to numerically explore the thermodynamics of chemical processes by directly solving the ensemble solution of the chemical master equation with efficient (sub-exponential) computational cost. We provide accurate estimates of the entropy production rate, heat flux, chemical work, and nonequilibrium thermodynamic potentials, free from sampling errors or mean-field approximations. We illustrate our results through a dissipative self-assembly model. In this way, we show how tensor networks can inform the design of efficient chemical processes in previously unattainable regimes."

In our calculations, we first study the normal-state density of states (DOS) in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures, and calculate the induced magnetic moments in the Nb layers. Next, we compute the momentum-resolved spectral functions in the superconducting state for the heterostructure with a single Mn layer, and find bands crossing the Fermi level within the superconducting (SC) gap. We also study the SC state DOS in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures and compare some of our results with experimental findings, revealing secondary gaps, plateau-like regions, and central V-shaped in-gap states within the bulk SC Nb gap that are magnetic-order-dependent. Finally, we compute the singlet and internally antisymmetric triplet (IAT) order parameters for each layer for both heterostructures, and find an order of magnitude difference in the induced singlet part of the SC order parameter in the Mn layer/s between the FM and AFM cases in favor of the AFM pairing with the maximum still being only 4.44% of the bulk Nb singlet order parameter value. We also find a negligible induced triplet part, yet comparable to the induced singlet values, indicating some singlet-triplet mixing in the Mn layer/s."

Our analysis reveals general principles for how search depends on heterogeneous diffusion and its interpretation (e.g. It\\^{o}, Stratonovich, or kinetic). An intricate picture emerges in which, for instance, increasing the diffusivity can decrease, not affect, or even increase the escape time. Our results could be used to determine the appropriate interpretation for specific physical systems."

      "summary": "In Si quantum dot systems, large magnetic field gradients are needed to implement spin rotations via electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR). By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures."

Here, we present a study of the magnetic diffuse scattering measured on a polycrystalline sample of UO$_2$, which we interpret in terms of its magnetic interactions between U$^{4+}$ magnetic moments. By refining values of the magnetic interaction parameters to magnetic diffuse-scattering data measured above the magnetic ordering transition temperature, we show that the dominant magnetic coupling in UO$_2$ is a bond-dependent interaction analogous to the Kitaev model of honeycomb magnets. We compare our experimental results with published theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum. Our results suggest that magnetic materials with $f$-electron magnetic ions, particularly actinides, may be promising candidates for realising Kitaev magnetism, and highlight the role that magnetic diffuse-scattering data can play in identifying such materials."

In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order."

      "summary": "Collective synchronization in complex systems arises from the interplay between topology and dynamics, yet how to design and control such patterns in higher-order networks remains unclear. Here we show that a Dirac spectral programming framework enables programmable topological cluster synchronization on directed hypergraphs. By encoding tail-head hyperedges into a topological Dirac operator and introducing a tunable mass term, we obtain a spectrum whose isolated eigenvalues correspond to distinct synchronization clusters defined jointly on nodes and hyperedges. Selecting a target eigenvalue allows the system to self-organize toward the associated cluster state without modifying the underlying hypergraph structure. Simulations on directed-hypergraph block models and empirical systems--including higher-order contact networks and the ABIDE functional brain network--confirm that spectral selection alone determines the accessible synchronization patterns. Our results establish a general and interpretable route for controlling collective dynamics in directed higher-order systems."

      "summary": "Scintillating molecular crystals have emerged as prime candidates for directional dark matter detector targets. This anisotropy makes them exquisitely sensitive due to the daily modulation induced by the directional dark matter wind. However, predicting the interaction rate for arbitrary molecules requires accurate modeling of the many-body ground as well as excited states, a task that has been historically computationally expensive. Here, we present a theory and computational framework for efficiently computing dark matter scattering form factors for molecules. We introduce SCarFFF, a GPU-accelerated code to compute the fully three-dimensional anisotropic molecular form factor for arbitrary molecules. We use a full time-dependent density functional theory framework to compute the lowest-lying singlet excited states, adopting the B3YLP exchange functional and a double-zeta Gaussian basis set. Once the many-body electronic structure is computed, the form factors are computed in a small fraction of the time from the transition density matrix. We show that ScarFFF can compute the first 12 form factors for a molecule of 10 heavy atoms in approximately 5 seconds, opening the door to accurate, high-throughput material screening for optimal directional dark matter detector targets. Our code can perform the calculation in three independent ways, two semi-analytical and one fully numeric, providing optimised methods for every precision goal."

      "summary": "The lack of long-range electrostatics is a key limitation of modern machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), hindering reliable applications to interfaces, charge-transfer reactions, polar and ionic materials, and biomolecules. In this Perspective, we distill two design principles behind the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, which can capture long-range interactions, charges, and electrical response just by learning from standard energy and force training data: (i) use a Coulomb functional form with environment-dependent charges to capture electrostatic interactions, and (ii) avoid explicit training on ambiguous density functional theory (DFT) partial charges. When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed."

Here we investigated the temporal stability of subtractively fabricated CMOS-compatible superconducting transmon qubits. During a single cooldown and over a period of 95 hours, we monitored several parameters for 8 qubits, including coherence times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, which exhibit fluctuations originating primarily from the interaction between two-level system (TLS) defects and the host qubit. We also demonstrate that subtractively-fabricated superconducting quantum devices align with the theoretical predictions that higher mean lifetimes $T_1$ correspond to larger fluctuations. To assess long-term stability, we tracked two representative qubits over 10 cooldown cycles spanning more than one year. We observed an average total downward shift in both qubit transition frequencies of approximately 61 MHz within the thermal cycles considered. In contrast, readout resonator frequencies decreased only marginally. Meanwhile, $T_1$ exhibits fluctuations from cycle to cycle, but maintains a stable baseline value."

However, direct experimental observations of interfacial thermal conductance across molecular junctions have remained challenging due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required for probing. Here, we report dynamic energy transport processes across multi-component molecular junctions observed at the atomic level by employing reflection ultrafast electron diffraction. A clear temporal sequence of energy transfer is revealed at early times following photoexcitation of Au(111) surfaces chemically bonded with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols: from the gold surface layer (SL) to the head groups of a SAM and then to the CH2-CH2 methylene lattice. Remarkably, the structural dynamics of the gold SL differ significantly from those of clean gold. Furthermore, the methylene lattice dynamics exhibit chain-length insensitivity but with a length-dependent retention time to reach full thermalization. Quantitatively, we find an agreement in the increased out-of-plane atomic motions between the surface gold atoms and the SAM methylene units, signifying the nature of motion-based coupling for interfacial energy transport. High interfacial thermal conductance (~300 MW/m^2/K) and high thermal conductivity for the methylene lattice (~60 W/m/K) are obtained under the condition of impulsive heating, which provide strong support for previous room-temperature theoretical predictions and also the ballistic nature of intrachain heat transfer. This time- and spatially-resolved experimental approach will enable future quantitative assessment of interfacial energy transport across solid-molecule junctions."

The VDMN captures microstructure-induced variability by embedding variational distributions within its hierarchical, mechanistic architecture. Using an analytic propagation scheme based on Taylor-series expansion and automatic differentiation, the VDMN efficiently propagates uncertainty through the network during training and prediction. We demonstrate its capabilities in two digital-twin-driven applications: (1) as an uncertainty-aware materials digital twin, it predicts and experimentally validates the nonlinear mechanical variability in additively manufactured polymer composites; and (2) as an inverse calibration engine, it disentangles and quantitatively identifies overlapping sources of uncertainty in constituent properties. Together, these results establish the VDMN as a foundation for uncertainty-robust materials digital twins."

      "summary": "The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural circuitry operates near criticality to reap the computational benefits of accessing a wide range of timescales. The theory of critical phenomena generally predicts heavy-tailed (power-law) correlations in space and time near criticality, but it has been argued that in the brain such correlations could be inherited from ``latent variables,'' such as external sensory signals that are not directly observed when recording from neural circuitry. Distinguishing whether heavy-tailed correlations in neural activity are intrinsically generated within a neural circuit or are driven by unobserved latent variables is crucial for properly interpreting circuit functions. We argue that measuring neural responses to sudden perturbative inputs, rather than correlations in ongoing activity, can disambiguate these cases. We demonstrate this approach in a model of stochastic spiking neuron populations receiving external latent input that can be tuned to a critical state. We propose a scaling theory for the covariance and response functions of the spiking network, which we validate with simulations. We end by discussing how our approach might generalize to models of neural populations with more realistic biophysical details."

Here, we address this problem using quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) combined with the recently developed photon-many-body dispersion (pMBD) functional, which can capture higher-order electron-photon correlations and multi-photon processes. We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems."

      "summary": "We employ the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA) to investigate the ultrafast optical excitations of germanium under intense, ultrashort pump pulses. The method has very low resource demand relative to many other available approaches and enables detailed calculation of the residual electron and hole populations induced by the pump pulse. It provides direct access to the energy distribution of excited carriers and to the total energy transferred to the system. By decomposing the response into contributions from different multi-photon resonant processes, we systematically study the dependence of excited-carrier density and absorbed energy on key pump-pulse parameters: duration, amplitude, and photon energy. Our results reveal a complex interplay between these parameters, governed by resonant Rabi-like dynamics and competition between different multi-photon absorption channels. For the studied germanium setup, we find that two-photon processes are generally dominant, while one- and three-photon channels become significant under specific conditions of pump-pulse frequency, duration, and intensity. This comprehensive analysis offers practical insights for optimizing ultrafast optical control in semiconductors by targeting specific multi-photon pathways."

      "summary": "This paper provides a construction and existence proof for a 1-parameter family of chiral unbalanced triply-periodic minimal surfaces of genus 4. We name these {\\textit{gyrating H'-T} surfaces, because they are related to Schoen's H'-T surfaces in a similar way as the Gyroid is to the Primitive surface. Their chirality is manifest in a screw symmetry of order six. The two labyrinthine domains on either side of the surface are not congruent, rather one representing the quartz net (\\texttt{qtz}) and the other one the dual of the quartz net (\\texttt{qzd}). The family tends to the Scherk saddle tower in one limit and to the doubly periodic Scherk surface in the other. The motivation for the construction was to construct a chiral tunable unbalanced surface family, originally as a template for photonic materials. The numeric construction is based on reverse-engineering of the tubular surface of two suitably chosen dual nets, using the \\textit{Surface Evolver}} to minimize area or curvature variations. The existence is proved using Weierstrass parametrizations defined on the branched torus."

We show how this asymmetry emerges both from variational principles with entropic constraints and from stochastic processes with reinforcement. We thus introduce the reinforced multinomial process and prove a large-deviation principle for its empirical histogram. The associated rate function reproduces precisely the entropy imbalance defining multiscale measures, thereby providing a genuine probabilistic mechanism for their emergence. The reinforced multinomial process thus offers a simple and rigorous stochastic foundation for multiscale Gibbs structures."

A first-principles route is established to reconstruct the relaxation function that underlies linear-response theory, thereby moving beyond phenomenological descriptions and enabling a consistent evaluation of all moments of the dissipated-work distribution in interacting systems. The predictive power of the approach is demonstrated for the Hubbard model subject to a staggered external potential, where the evolution of the relaxation dynamics across the Mott-to-band-insulator crossover reveals how distinct many-body phases shape the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic response. These results provide a microscopic and transferable framework for quantum thermodynamics in correlated systems, bridging thermal density functional theory and nonequilibrium work statistics."

However, when studying the physics of electron emission and propagation at the mesoscale it becomes necessary to consider the discrete nature of electronic charge to account for the space-charge effect of each individual point charge. In this paper we give an extensive analysis of some previous work on the distribution of electrons under space-charge limited conditions. We examine the spacing of electrons as they are emitted from a planar surface, We present simplified models for analysis of such conditions to derive scaling laws for emission and compare them to computer simulations."

      "summary": "Microscale additive manufacturing of reflective copper is becoming increasingly important for microelectronics and microcomputers, due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing."

      "summary": "Water nanoconfinement is known to occur inside material void spaces, such as 2D confinement between surfaces, 1D confinement inside nanotubes, and variable-dimension confinement inside nanoporous materials. In the present work we investigate, through molecular dynamics simulations, the morphologies and self-diffusion coefficient of water channels that are nanoconfined in the void space between adjacent surfaces of nanotube bundles - an existing class of materials. In our simulations, we begin with water filling completely the void space, and then we progressively increase the inter-surface separation, maintaining the water content. We find that, as the inter-surface separation progresses, the dimensionality of the water channel decreases from 2D to 1D, the latter consisting of self-confined water channels along surface grooves. The morphologies and self-diffusion coefficients of these 1D water nanochannels are strongly dependent on the nature of the water-surface interaction and on the diameter of the nanotubes. Interestingly, as we decrease the nanotube diameter from 10 to 5 nm, the self-diffusion coefficients of the 1D channels increase by tenfold for hydrophilic surfaces and by sixfold for hydrophobic surfaces, surpassing, in both cases, the bulk water values. We also investigated the water channels at the interstitial voids of the bulk bundle material, finding 1D water channels that are similar to the surface ones."

      "summary": "In the most extended layer of the inner crust of neutron stars, nuclear matter is believed to form a crystal of clusters immersed in a superfluid neutron gas. Here we analyze this phase of matter within fully self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations using Skyrme-type energy density functionals for the mean field and a separable interaction in the pairing channel. The periodicity of the lattice is taken into account using Bloch boundary conditions, in order to describe the interplay between band structure and superfluidity. A relative flow between the clusters and the surrounding neutron gas is introduced in a time-independent way. As a consequence, the complex order parameter develops a phase, and in the rest frame of the superfluid one finds a counterflow between neutrons inside and outside the clusters. The neutron superfluid fraction is computed from the resulting current. Our results indicate that at densities above 0.03 fm$^{-3}$, more than 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid, independently of the detailed choice of the interaction, cluster charge, and lattice geometry. This fraction is only slightly lower than the one obtained recently within linear response theory on top of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approximation, and it approaches the hydrodynamic limit for strong pairing. As a consequence, it is likely that the inner crust alone can provide a sufficient superfluid angular momentum reservoir to explain pulsar glitches."

In the classical limit the system dynamics is converged to a strange chaotic attractor. The quantum properties of this system are studied for the density matrix in the frame of Lindblad equation. In the case of dissipative quantum evolution the steady-state density matrix is converged to a quantum strange attractor being similar to the classical one. It is shown that depending on the dissipation strength there is a regime when the eigenstates of density matrix are localized at a strong or moderate dissipation. At a weak dissipation the eigenstates are argued to be delocalized being linked to the Ehrenfest explosion of quantum wave packet. This phenomenon is related with the Lyapunov exponent and Ehrenfest time for the quantum strange attractor. Possible experimental realisations of this quantum strange attractor with fluxonium are discussed."

      "summary": "Segregation is a growing concern around the world. One of its main manifestations is the creation of ghettos, whose inhabitants have difficult access to well-paid jobs, which are often located far from their homes. In order to study this phenomenon, we propose an extension of Schelling's model of segregation to take into account the existence of economic exchanges. To approximate a geographical model of the city, we consider a small-world network with a defined real estate market. The evolution of the system has also been studied, finding that economic exchanges follow exponential laws and relocations are approximated by power laws. In addition to this, we consider the existence of delays in the actions of the agents, which mainly affect the happiness of those with fewer economic resources. Besides, the size of the economic exchange plays a crucial role in overall segregation. Despite its simplicity, we find that our model reproduces real-world situations such as the separation between favoured and handicapped economic areas, the importance of economic contacts between them to improve the distribution of wealth, and the existence of efficient and cheap transport to break the poverty cycles typical of disadvantaged zones."

Here we extend the technique by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are quantitatively described by an ellipsoid model, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. Evaluation the distribution of the fit error across the set of measured particles, the material permittivity dataset and surface damping parameter g providing the best fit are found to be the single crystal dataset by Olmon et al. [Phys. Rev. B 86, 235147 (2012)] and g = 1.8, respectively. The precision of the retrieved aspect ratio is below 5%, and all three ellipsoidal semi-axes are determined with an impressive precision of 0.25 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength, and taking them into account improves the accuracy to below a nanometer."

The Euclidean time evolution is induced by the Rindler Hamiltonian and behaves as the regulator that tames the divergence induced by the local operator, while the Lorentzian one is induced by the uniform Hamiltonian. Under these time evolutions, we investigate the time ordering effect of the Rindler Euclidean and uniform Lorentzian time evolution operators. Consequently, we find the remarkable differences between those time evolutions are induced by whether those are unitary or non-unitary. Especially, we find that the unitary time evolution induces the late-time logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy, while the non-unitary time evolution induces the late-time constant behavior. Furthermore, we investigate the dual gravity of the systems under consideration. Especially, we investigate the gravity duals of the systems with the insertion of the heavy primary operator and show that it is a black brane with a spacetime-dependent horizon."

We exploit Vogel spirals, an aperiodic geometry where a single parameter dictates spatial correlations, to show how correlation strength reshapes the modal spectrum and transient dynamics of near-field coupling.

Specifically, freeze-dried gelatin-based scaffolds were infused with sol-gel-derived powders of Cu-doped akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) and bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) at various concentrations (10, 20, and 30 wt%). The scaffolds were initially characterized for their structural integrity, biodegradability, swelling behavior, impact on physiological pH, and cytocompatibility with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The silicate incorporation effectiveness in promoting vascularity was then assessed through HUVEC attachment, capillary tube formation, and ex-ovo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assays. The findings revealed significant improvements in both in-vitro and ex-ovo vascularity of the gelatin scaffolds upon the addition of Cu-doped akermanite. The most effective concentrations were determined to be 10 and 20%, which led to notable HUVEC metabolic activity, a well-spread morphology with extensive peripheral filopodia and lamellipodia at 10% and a cobblestone phenotype indicative of in-vivo endothelium at 20% during cell attachment, the formation of complex networks of tubular structures, and robust vascularization in chick embryo development. Moving forward, the incorporation of Cu-doped akermanite into tissue-engineering scaffolds shows great potential for addressing the limitations of vascularization, especially for critical-sized bone defects, by facilitating the controlled release of pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic ions."

These threads have so far largely progressed independently, whereas placing free electrons in a driven nonlinear system can potentially activate coherent parametric interaction channels for joint state engineering of both types of particles. Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schr\\\"odinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons."

      "summary": "The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $\\omega$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $\\mu$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \\ll \\omega,k\\ll \\mu$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $\\omega,k,T\\ll\\mu$ at leading order in $T/\\mu$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies."

Recent advances integrate LLMs into agentic frameworks, enabling retrieval, reasoning, and tool use for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present a domain-specialized agent designed for reliable automation of first-principles materials computations. By embedding domain expertise, the agent ensures physically coherent multi-step workflows and consistently selects convergent, well-posed parameters, thereby enabling reliable end-to-end computational execution. A new benchmark of diverse computational tasks demonstrates that our system significantly outperforms standalone LLMs in both accuracy and robustness.

In our studies, both the Ohnesorge number Oh and the Deborah number De are O1, a typically inaccessible regime with conventional extensional rheometers. Under magnetic forcing, the nanoparticles assemble into field aligned, chainlike structures, that generate a tunable magnetoelastic response, and markedly alter the extensional flow. Although behaving as Newtonian liquids in the absence of a magnetic field, the field induces extensional thickening, and the emergence of beads on a string BOAS structures in the ferrofluid filaments, a non-Newtonian signature. By combining controlled elongation with high speed imaging, we directly quantify the magnetic field-dependent extensional viscosity and relaxation time. Our findings underscore how magnetically induced microstructures govern filament stability and extensional dynamics in ferrofluids."

      "summary": "Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction."

In a 2D lattice, this can be explained by currents flowing around obstacles; (b) exhibit bad-metal electrical transport with Drude-like thermal transport, though it is not Drude, and, notably, (c) display an approximately $B$-linear longitudinal magnetoresistance at large fields, similar to Effective Medium Theory.

Going beyond conventional Hermitian physics, we analyze the impact of non-Hermiticity in the quantum state transmission by employing a non-Hermitian spin chain that functions as a quantum data bus. By deriving a general expression for the fidelity of quantum state transfer for a U(1)-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we analyze PT-symmetric XX and SSH models, complemented by a numerical study of the RT-symmetric iXY model. We demonstrate that, in several parameter regimes, the transfer fidelity in the non-Hermitian setting exceeds the classical threshold and can even exceed the performance of the corresponding Hermitian models. In particular, for the SSH model with dominant inter-cell coupling, the broken phase supports near-unit-fidelity quantum state transfer, a level of performance that the corresponding Hermitian model fails to attain. Moreover, we establish a correspondence between the non-Hermitian and Hermitian descriptions by identifying related parameter regions in which the fidelity fails to surpass the classical bound."

While non-interacting topological single-particle systems have been studied in detail, topology in quantum many-body systems remains an open problem. Specifically, in the quantum many-body limit, one of the challenges lies in the computational complexity of obtaining the many-body ground state and its many-body topological invariant. While algorithms to compute ground states with quantum computers have been heavily investigated, algorithms to compute topological invariants in a quantum computer are still under active development. Here we demonstrate a quantum circuit to compute the many-body topological invariant of a second-order topological quantum magnet encoded in qubits. Our algorithm relies on a quantum circuit adiabatic evolution in transverse paths in parameter space, and we uncover hidden topological invariants depending on the traversed path. Our work puts forward an algorithm to leverage quantum computers to characterize many-body topological quantum matter."

In this framework, the Bethe-root distribution of the associated quantum field theory yields an Abelian differential of the second kind on the elliptic Riemann surface specified by the spectral endpoints, a structure central to the algebro-geometric theory of solitons. The semiclassical parameter is identified with the large-rank limit of the internal symmetry group ($O(2N)$) of the underlying quantum field theory (the Gross-Neveu model with a chemical potential). Our analysis indicates that the analytic structure of the spectrum is dictated solely by the Dynkin diagram ($D_N$) and its large-rank limit ($D_\\infty$), independently of the particular integrable model used to realize it."

Although Lorentz violation is introduced only through the kinetic sector, the renormalization structure is nontrivial: interactions generate additional couplings, including masses and linear terms, so a consistent renormalization--group analysis cannot be formulated in terms of modified kinetic terms alone and requires an RG--complete operator basis compatible with the reduced symmetry. We perform a systematic one--loop renormalization and derive the complete set of beta functions for cubic and quartic couplings, masses, and linear terms. We identify and analyze the resulting fixed points and fixed manifolds, showing in particular how anisotropy restricts their existence and stability. In particular we obtain how anisotropy restricts existence of canonical Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Also we provide a transparent physical interpretation of the anisotropy--dependent coefficients appearing in the beta functions and clarify how kinetic mixing reshapes the interaction flow through the available ultraviolet phase space."

We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \\times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits."

      "summary": "Johnson noise is a small random voltage that appears between terminals of any resistor interacting with its thermal bath at temperature T. It looks like continuous, but the discreteness of the electrical charge suggests its discrete origin coming from the charge noise due to random translocations of individual electrons between terminals. The capacitance allowing these translocations would quantize the energy entering the resistor in this way, thus acting as the antenna of the resistor to pick up thermal energy in the form of charge unbalances (fluctuations of energy) between its terminals. The subsequent relaxations of these fluctuations by the conductance G=1/R of the resistor (the collective reaction of all its carriers) would give rise to its Johnson noise. This collective reaction to dissipate fluctuations of energy caused by individual electrons, agrees with the Fluctuation-Dissipation framework that Callen and Welton proposed in 1951 for noisy processes."

The lamella was doped with various amounts of lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) until very high loadings with ratios of EO monomers to cations up to 1:1 were reached. We present insights into the structure and ion transport from extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. For high salt concentrations most cations are not coordinated by PEO but rather by TFSI and THF. More specifically, LiTFSI partially separates from the PEO domain and forms a network-like structure in the middle of the lamella. This central salt-rich layer plays a decisive role to enable remarkably good cationic mobilities as well as high transport numbers in agreement with the experimental results."

      "summary": "One of the critical challenges in enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells is reducing the density of trap states in the light-absorbing perovskite layer. These trap states lead to increased charge carrier recombination, thus dropping device efficiency. Space charge limited current (SCLC) analysis serves as a valuable method to study trap density, requiring structures capable of selectively transporting either electrons or holes. By analyzing current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and identifying the voltage at which the slope changes, trap density can be calculated effectively. Traditional organic polymer hole transport layers such as Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, and PTAA face challenges, including moisture instability, low charge mobility, low conductivity, and high costs. This work introduces a novel hole-only device structure utilizing inorganic materials, offering improved stability, straightforward fabrication, and reduced costs compared to conventional structures. This device comprises a nanostructured NiOx layer, a perovskite layer, a copper indium selenide (CIS) layer, and an Au electrode on an ITO substrate. The performance of this structure is assessed by fabricating various perovskite layers under different experimental conditions. The trap density was successfully determined using the proposed hole-only device structure. Analysis of the photovoltaic properties revealed a clear correlation between trap density in the perovskite layers and the overall performance of the solar cells."

Here, we report the realization of nearly-room-temperature itinerant ferromagnetism in Co doped Fe5GeTe2 thin flakes. The ferromagnetic transition temperature TC (~ 323 K - 337 K) is almost unchanged when thickness is down to 12 nm and is still about 284 K at 2 nm (bilayer thickness). Theoretical calculations further indicate that the ferromagnetism persists in monolayer Fe4CoGeTe2. In addition to the robust ferromagnetism down to the ultrathin limit, Fe4CoGeTe2 exhibits an unusual temperature- and thickness-dependent intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. We propose that it could be ascribed to the dependence of band structure on thickness that changes the Berry curvature near the Fermi energy level subtly. The nearly-room-temperature ferromagnetism and tunable anomalous Hall effect in atomically thin Fe4CoGeTe2 provide opportunities to understand the exotic transport properties of two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials and explore their potential applications in spintronics."

However, attribution of a specific growth mechanism based on orientation can be ambiguous unless mask continuity and substrate pre-treatment are evaluated within a single process window. We compare GaN grown under identical conditions on four m-plane sapphire templates: (i) bare, (ii) \"graphene-grown\" (high-temperature Ar/H2 with CH4 on), (iii) \"anneal-only\" (high-temperature Ar/H2 with CH4 off), and (iv) graphene oxide spin-coated and reduced on pristine sapphire. GaN selects (103) on graphene-grown and anneal-only m-plane sapphire, selects (100) on bare m-plane sapphire, and is predominantly (100) with a minority (103) on graphene oxide spin-coated and reduced/pristine m-plane sapphire. High-resolution TEM shows that, on partly graphene-covered samples, nucleation occurs on exposed sapphire (thru-hole), not on graphene, providing mechanism evidence independent of orientation. Within this window, the substrate surface state set by high-temperature Ar/H2 pre-treatment (rather than mask continuity) primarily governs orientation, while open-area effects can play a secondary role. Thus, preferred orientation alone may not determine the growth mechanism; mask continuity and substrate pre-treatment must be explicitly controlled when using orientation as evidence for mechanism assignment."

      "summary": "Kagome materials have attracted enormous research interest recently owing to their diverse topological phases and manifestation of electronic correlation. Here, we present the electronic structure of a distorted ferromagnetic kagome metal, NdTi3Bi4, exhibiting a transition temperature of 9 K. Our investigation employs a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discover the presence of two flat bands which are found to originate from the kagome structure formed by Ti atoms with major contribution from Ti dxy and Ti dx2-y2 orbitals. We also observed multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) in its electronic structure, with one VHS lying near the Fermi level. The ARPES data reveals the existence of Dirac cone at the K point, a finding which is corroborated by our DFT calculations. These findings present detailed electronic structure capable of hosting correlation-driven phenomenon in this novel ferromagnetic kagome metal."

In terms of the configurational geometry (i.e., information about configurational density of states), the nonlinearity has been measured as special vector on configuration space, which is extended to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on statistical manifold. Although they successfully provide new insight into how the geometry of lattice characterizes the nonlinearity, their application is essentially restricted to thermodynamic equilibrium. Based on the resource theory (especially, thermo-majorization), we here extend the applicability of the nonlinearity to nonequilibrium states obtained through single-shot work on Gibbs state. We reveal that the extended nonlinearity for nonequilibrium state is bounded from upper and lower by the information about one of the optimal Renyi divergences for equilibrium states in between practical and linear systems, and temperature and work."

These phases include the Kalmeyer-Laughlin type chiral spin liquid (CSL) and a valence bond solid (VBS). A natural question arises regarding the robustness of these phases in the presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In this study, we derive the effective spin model for the spin-orbit coupled triangular lattice Hubbard model in the weak Mott insulting regime, including all SOC-mediated spin-bilinears and ring-exchange interactions. We then construct a simplified spin model keeping only the most relevant SOC-mediated spin interactions. Using infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) we show that the CSL and VBS phases of the triangular lattice Hubbard model can be stabilized in the presence of a weak SOC. The stabilization results from a compensation between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a SOC-mediated ring exchange interaction. We also provide additional qualitative arguments to intuitively understand the compensation mechanism in the iDMRG quantum phase diagrams. This mechanism for stabilization can potentially be useful for the experimental realization of quantum spin liquids."

      "summary": "We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself."

We also obtain that the magnetic ground state is the G-type antiferromagnetic order, in agreement with the R-point Jahn-Teller distortion and that the magnetic moment of the Co atoms contains a strong orbital contribution ($m_L=0.95$ $\\mu_B$ in the cubic phase and 0.55 $\\mu_B$ in the tetragonal phase). Furthermore, we compute the dynamical magnetic effective charges and show that it is zero by symmetry for the Co and they can reach a value as large as 200 $10^{-2}\\mu_{\\text{B}}/\\text{\\r{A}}$ for the apical F anion. This large magnetic effective charge comes from the spin-orbit coupling (50\\% of the response is from the orbital moment) contrary to the rare-earth manganites and ferrites with similar order of magnitude but originating from the exchange striction mechanism. The fact that the dynamical magnetic effective charges are non-zero also proves that the tetragonal phase of KCoF$_3$ is antimagnetoelectric with a large magnetic sublattice magnetoelectric response of 210 ps/m per spin-channel. We also discuss the generality of these magnetic effective charges."

Nonetheless, we show that the dynamics of such systems are governed by a \"generalized free energy\" that is derived from a large-deviations variational principle. This variational principle also yields a decomposition of fluxes, forces, and dissipation (entropy production) into a conservative \"excess\" part and a nonconservative \"housekeeping\" part. Our decomposition is universally applicable to stochastic master equations, deterministic chemical reaction networks, and open systems. We also show that the excess entropy production obeys a thermodynamic speed limit (TSL), a fundamental thermodynamic constraint on the rate of state evolution and/or external fluxes. We demonstrate our approach on several examples, including real-world metabolic networks, where we derive fundamental dissipation bounds and uncover \"futile\" metabolic cycles. Our generalized free energy and decomposition are empirically accessible to thermodynamic inference in both stochastic and deterministic systems. We discuss important connections to several theoretical frameworks, including information geometry and Onsager theory, as well as previous excess/housekeeping decompositions."

While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering fine control of polar fluids even in the absence of free charges. Despite their vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level due to the absence of a rigorous first-principles theory of electrostriction. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillarity. We demonstrate that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish \"dielectrocapillarity\" -- the use of EFGs to manipulate confined fluids -- as a powerful mechanism for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, holding immense potential for energy storage, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidics. Furthermore, by linking nanoscale dielectrocapillarity to macroscopic dielectrowetting, we establish a foundation for field-controlled wetting and adsorption phenomena of polar fluids across length scales."

Further, the coexistence of the out-of-plane polarization with in-plane conductivity induced by electrostatic charge doping makes these systems strong candidates for realizing ferroelectric metals. Using density functional theory calculations, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based Janus sliding ferroelectric bilayers XMY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X $\\neq$ Y). In addition to exhibiting switchable interlayer polarization, Janus sliding ferroelectrics possess an intrinsic electric field within each monolayer, arising from the electronegativity difference between the chalcogen atoms. We discover that the intrinsic electric field of the monolayers can be used to modulate the interlayer ferroelectric polarization and the electronic band structure. We identify the decrease in the interlayer distance due to a particular stacking of the Janus bilayers as a major contributor to increasing polarization and reducing the bandgap. The direction of the intrinsic electric field within the Janus monolayers plays a significant role in the modulation of layer-wise contribution in the valence and conduction bands, which influences the polarization reduction due to extrinsic charge dopants. Extending this concept to Janus trilayers, we observe further enhancement in polarization and additional bandgap reduction compared to their bilayer counterparts. These results highlight the tunability of TMD-based Janus sliding ferroelectrics and suggest a pathway for designing low bandgap ferroelectrics and potential ferroelectric metals."

Here, we address this central issue by calculating $n_s(T)$ for a generic model two-dimensional PDW superconductor. We uncover a surprisingly large region of intrinsic instability, associated with negative $n_s(T)$, revealing that a significant portion of the parameter space thought to be physical cannot support a pure PDW order. In the remaining stable regime, we predict two striking and observable fingerprints: a small longitudinal superfluid response and an unusual temperature dependence for $n_s(T)$. These generally model-independent, as well as experimentally relevant findings suggest that the fragility of the superfluid density poses a significant problem for the formation of stable, finite temperature PDW superconductivity."

      "summary": "We study a gas of $N$ Brownian particles in the presence of a common stochastic diffusivity $D(t)=B^2(t)$, where $B(t)$ represents a one-dimensional Brownian motion at time $t$. Starting from all the particles localized at the origin, the gas expands with a ballistic scaling $x\\sim t$. We show that because of the common stochastic diffusivity, the expanding gas gets dynamically correlated, and the joint probability density function of the position of the particles has a CIID structure that was recently found in several other systems. The special structure allows us to compute the average density profile of the gas, extreme and order statistics, gap distribution between successive particles, and the full counting statistics (FCS) that describes the probability density function (PDF) $H(\\kappa, t)$ of the fraction of particles $\\kappa$ in a given region $[-L,L]$. Interestingly, the position fluctuation of the central particles and the average density profiles are described by the same scaling function. The PDF describing the FCS has an essential singularity near $\\kappa=0$, indicating the presence of particles inside the box $[-L,L]$ at all times. Near the upper limit $\\kappa =1$, the scaling function $H(\\kappa,t)$ has a rather unusual behavior: $H(\\kappa,t)\\sim (1-\\kappa)^{\\beta(t)}$ where the exponent $\\beta(t)$ changes continuously with time. At early times $\\beta(t)$ is negative, indicating a divergence of $H(\\kappa,t)$ as $\\kappa\\to 1$, whereas $\\beta(t)$ becomes positive for $t>t_c$ where $t_c$ is computed exactly. Thus, as a function of $t$, the FCS exhibits an interesting shape transition. We also obtain the PDFs of the first-passage time to a given position $x$ and first-exit time from a box $[-L,L]$, by any one of the particles, and find that both PDFs are described by the same scaling function."

      "summary": "We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage problems of currents with two boundaries in Markov chains. Using this method, we derive a thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation in terms of the splitting probability and the first-passage time statistics of a fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality. We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents -- those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation -- satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy production at random times and uses martingale methods to perform time-reversal of first-passage quantities."

      "summary": "Various mechanical phenomena depend on the length scale, and these have inspired a variety of nonlocal and higher gradient continuum theories. Mechanistically, it is believed that the length scale dependence arises due to an interplay between the length scale of heterogeneities in the material, the length scale of the material being probed and the phenomenon under study. In this paper, we seek to understand this interplay in a simple setting by studying the overall behavior of a one-dimensional periodic medium governed by strain gradient elasticity at the microstructural scale. We find through numerical experiments that the overall behavior is not described by a strain gradient elasticity. In other words, strain gradient theories are not invariant under averaging at this scale. We also find that the overall behavior may be described by a kernel-based nonlocal elasticity theory, but the kernel is highly oscillatory with slow decay. So we seek alternate characterization. First, we limit our interest to a range of length scales, and show that the behavior is described well by fractional strain gradient elasticity. Consequently, one can obtain various scaling laws with exponent between zero (classical elasticity) and one (strain-gradient elasticity). Second, we take a data-driven approach, and show that we can describe the overall behavior over a range of scales using a Fourier neural operator."

In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \\textit{d}-orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. Here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\\textsubscript{3}, via complementary spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and providing a robust experimental demonstration that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism is attributable to orbital mixing between I \\textit{p} and Cr \\textit{e\\textsubscript{g}} states. These findings reveal the microscopic connection between orbital and spin degrees of freedom, providing fundamental insights into the behavior of low-dimensional magnetic materials."

      "summary": "Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an \"entanglement susceptibility\", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems."

Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures."

      "summary": "Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations, volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by N\\'eel vector switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that all-collinear AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM interfaces are harnessed."

We compare the properties of possible uniform phases and construct the Hartree--Fock phase diagrams, which include sizeable phase separation regions. It is seen that the excitonic insulator can appear as a component phase in a mixed-phase state in a broad interval of doping levels. In addition, in a certain range of parameter values the excitonic metal (doped excitonic insulator) is identified as the lowest-energy uniform phase. We suggest that this phase, which is unstable with respect to phase separation, may be stabilised when the phase separation is suppressed by the long-range Coulomb interaction. Overall, we find that excitonic correlations can affect the behaviour of the system relatively far away from half-filling."

By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen for the temperature range where electrons occupy excited states. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies.

      "summary": "Crystalline two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors often combine high elasticity and in-plane strength, making them ideal for strain-induced tuning of electronic characteristics, akin to strategies used in silicon electronics. However, existing techniques have not achieved strain in 2D materials that is simultaneously high in magnitude (>1%), stable over long periods, and spatially programmable, meaning the strain level can be deterministically engineered across different regions of a single 2D layer. Here, we apply spatially programmable biaxial strain (e_b) up to 2.2% with spatial resolution of 0.13 %e_b um-1 in monolayer MoS2 via conformal transfer onto patterned substrates fabricated using two-photon lithography. The induced strain is stable for months and enables local band gap tuning of ~0.4 eV in monolayer MoS2, ~25% of its intrinsic band gap. We further extend the approach to bilayer WS2-MoS2 heterostructures. This strain-engineering technique introduces a new regime of strain-enabled control in 2D semiconductors to support the development of wide-spectrum optoelectronic devices and nanoelectronics with engineered electronic landscapes."

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system."

While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights, thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions hosting Majorana zero modes."

The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in spin density wave theory. Magnetotransport measurements, including observation of the Yamaji angle, show clear evidence of hole pocket quasiparticles which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers, and are consistent with the FL* description. The FL* phase of a single-band model is described using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid (FL) at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of the FL*-FL metal-metal transition without a symmetry-breaking order parameter, using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model to two spatial dimensions. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals."

      "summary": "Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential for understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the temperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with the exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements insufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and giving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport and umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion renormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise the electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a direct separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to resistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in magic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate transport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic angle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust quadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where standard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band scattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown of Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the interaction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron collisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes THz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling scattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials."

      "summary": "We develop an experimental double-model analysis, combined with density-functional theory (DFT), to investigate the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) associated with the electron-capture (EC) decay ``aftereffects'' phenomenon. This electronic phenomenon, which is reversible with temperature, is typically observed in TDPAC experiments on oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC) $\\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd probe atoms and was recently explained within an $ab$ $initio$ framework based on fluctuations in the number of trapped electron holes at $^{111}$Cd [Phys. Rev. B $\\bf{105}$, 195201 (2022)]. From now on, it is possible to determine, for each measured temperature and observed HFI, the set of $initial$ electronic configurations around the probe nucleus and their associated EFGs, whose fluctuations produce these dynamic HFIs, rather than simply identifying the configuration that generates the stable final EFG when the dynamic process ends. We demonstrate the equivalence between the two most used methods for analyzing this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\\\"averstam $et$ $al.$ (BO approach) and Lupascu $et$ $al.$ (L approach), successfully connecting the relaxation constant $\\lambda$$_r$ (the damping strength of the TDPAC spectra) in the BO approach with the distribution's half-width $\\delta$$_i$ of the initial fluctuating EFGs in the L approach. To address this, we perform a comprehensive DFT study of Cd-doped $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed \\emph{ab initio} analysis of defect-formation energies, both as a function of the Cd impurity's charge state, to unravel controversial TDPAC results reported for $^{111}$In-implanted $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals, now revisited. These results quantitatively confirm the physical scenario underlying both the BO and L approaches, and this new method can also be applied to other TDPAC probes without EC."

      "summary": "The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems."

      "summary": "A promising approach to transport cargo at the microscale lies within the use of self-propelled microorganisms, whose motion entrains that of passive particles. However, most applications remain limited to just a few passive particles of similar size as the microorganisms, since the transport mechanism relies on the interaction between individual swimmers and single particles. Here, we demonstrate how to control the collective transport of hundreds of large passive particles with phototactic microalga. Using directional light stimuli in suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we trigger bioconvection rolls capable of macroscale transport. Passive particles an order of magnitude larger than the microalgae are either attracted or repelled by the rolls depending on their density. Using experiments and simulation, we rationalize these bioconvective flows and describe how to harness them for cargo transport, with future applications in targeted drug delivery and decontamination."

      "summary": "Experimental and theoretical studies of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia physical properties are hot topics in fundamental and applied science. However, magnetic and charge transport properties of HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles are very poorly studied theoretically and experimentally. In this work we observed a superparamagnetic-like and superparaelectric-like response of ultra-small (5 - 10 nm in size) HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The EPR spectra of HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders reveal the presence of paramagnetic defect centers, which are the oxygen vacancies with one captured electron, and hafnium or zirconium ions that changed their oxidation state from +4 to +3 due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree \"y\" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in the HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence of the orthorhombic phase. Due to the flexo-electro-chemical strains, presumably induced by the oxygen vacancies and their complexes accumulated near their surface, the ultra-small HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles reveal superparaelectric-like behavior, posistor-like effect and significant values of accumulated charge. We observed that the quasi-static relative dielectric permittivity of the HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders overcomes 107 and related the colossal values with the superparaelectric state of the nanoparticles cores induced by the flexo-electro-chemical strains."

      "summary": "We use a first-principles calculations approach to reveal the electronic and magnetic properties of chromium diiodide (CrI$_2$) bilayers and establish a hierarchy of magnetic interactions across stable registries. The monolayer presents a x-stripe antiferromagnetic ground state, while in bilayers the BA$^\\prime$ stacking is the global minimum with antiparallel interlayer magnetic alignment. Bilayer configurations strengthen the exchange in the plane by 6 % to 10 %, while the exchange between layers is registry-dependent. The symmetry of each stacking configuration allows for anisotropic interactions. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms appear in structures without inversion symmetry, which in this case also generates in-plane polarizations of up to $\\sim$ 10 $\\mu$C/cm$^2$, resulting in direct magnetoelectric coupling that is absent in centrosymmetric monolayers. Thus, stacking acts both as a selector of exchange anisotropy and as a driver of magnetoelectricity. Our results show that bilayer CrI$_2$ can be mechanically reconfigured through interlayer sliding, with energy differences between stacking orders (25-50 meV/f.u.) that are compatible with experimental actuation. Tunable magnetism and register-dependent polarization offer promising opportunities for novel spintronic devices, where structural transitions can affect both magnetic states and electric dipoles."

      "summary": "Active navigation in disordered media depends on a biased random walk interacting with environmental constraints. Using E. coli chemotactic navigation in agar gels as a model system, we reveal a fundamental trade-off between diffusive exploration and chemotactic directional bias that dictates the optimal strategy for population range expansion. Counter-intuitively, evolution selects for shorter mean run times ({\\tau}_f) to achieve faster chemotactic migration in denser environments. Controlled experiments reveal a non-monotonic relationship between chemotactic navigation speed and {\\tau}_f, with the optimum shifting according to the density of physical traps in the gel. Single-cell analysis demonstrates that escape from these traps occurs independently of the tumbling mechanism, challenging the classical view that reorientation is essential for navigation in obstructed spaces. Based on these insights, we develop a minimal theoretical model showing that the optimal {\\tau}_f emerges from an antagonistic scaling: while the diffusion coefficient increases with {\\tau}_f, the chemotactic bias coefficient decreases with it. This work establishes a general principle for optimizing active transport through complex, disordered environments."

Here we analyze how an external imprinting or the thermal fluctuations of the condensate phase influence this expansion. In both cases, we find that the curved geometry filters the imploding finite angular-momentum modes via a radial centrifugal potential, so that only the condensate state can reach the origin and form the central peak. As a consequence, we observe a pronounced dependence of the central density on the imprinting strength and on temperature. This geometric filtering effect characterizes the free expansion of curved atomic gases in contrast with flat counterparts, it is easily observable in the available experimental platforms, and enables two-dimensional shells thermometry via simple absorption-imaging techniques."

      "summary": "The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerics that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. In this work we revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\\propto \\sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$."

      "summary": "To elucidate the photon detection mechanism of superconducting single-photon detectors, we theoretically examine the dynamics of type-II superconductors with a bias current using the two-dimensional time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau and the Maxwell equations. The photon injection that weakens the superconducting order parameter is treated phenomenologically as a local temperature increase, and the amount of injection is controlled by the initial hotspot radius. The photon is detected by the voltage change between two electrodes attached to the left and right edges of the superconductor. We find that certain parameter ranges can be explained by the traditionally considered hotspot model, while other parameter ranges are governed by the generation and annihilation of superconducting vortex and antivortex pairs. The photon detection is possible for an initial hotspot radius that exceeds a threshold value. We find that the generation of a vortex--antivortex pair occurs near the threshold. The flow of the pair perpendicular to the current direction finally creates a normal region for the photon detection. The voltage change for the Ginzburg--Landau parameter close to the transition point from type-II to type-I superconductor shows anomalous behavior that is not associated with the dynamics of the vortex--antivortex pair. We also examine the effects of spatially non-uniform current density on the voltage change and the superconducting order parameter to provide a hint to understand the behavior of wide-strip single-photon detectors. The estimated values of incident photon energy and response time for photon detection are reasonable in comparison with experiments. The present comprehensive examination provides useful guidelines for flexible design of device structures."

While neutral two-particle excitations (excitons) have been observed in tr-ARPES, signatures of trions -- three-quasiparticle bound states -- have only been probed via optical spectroscopy. Here, we develop a general theory for the ARPES signature of trions in the model system of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). We simulate the ARPES signals of both positively and negatively charged trions and show that the interaction of the residual holes, or electron and hole, lead to large energy shifts, on the order of the exciton binding energy, compared to the exciton signal. For positive trions, the additional momentum degree of freedom of the residual particles removes any strict lower bound on the photoemission energy, leading to distinctive asymmetric spectral features. For negative trions, the photoemission process causes the tr-ARPES spectrum to reproduce inverted images of the exciton band structure for multiple exciton states, encompassing both spin-allowed and spin-forbidden states, providing a direct momentum-resolved probe of both trion and exciton physics."

A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\\pi$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and N\\'eel ordered states in the three-color $\\pi$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger N\\'eel ordering on the $\\pi$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and N\\'eel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and N\\'eel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle."

      "summary": "Natural hydrogen generated by water-rock interaction in ultramafic rocks is increasingly recognised as a potentially important primary energy resource, but the pore-scale processes that control the initiation and early transport of a free gas phase remain poorly constrained. Here we present an in situ X-ray micro-tomography experiment in which an ultramafic granular pack of dunnite from West Papua, Indonesia, saturated with KI-doped brine, is heated to 100C with a pore pressure of 4bar under 10bar confining pressure inside a micro-CT scanner. Time-resolved 4D imaging captures the transition from a fully liquid-saturated pore space to the appearance and growth of a distinct gas phase after an 8h induction period. Bubbles first nucleate near the top of the sample before becoming distributed throughout the imaged volume as a connected ganglia. The nucleating gas phase is most plausibly dominated by molecular hydrogen generated by low-temperature fluid-rock reaction, as indicated by independent hydrogen-presence detectors, although we cannot yet fully exclude minor contributions from other gases. SEM-BEX imaging reveals textural alteration and local changes in elemental signals between reacted and unreacted material. Taken together, these observations provide spatially and temporally resolved evidence for gas generation during low-temperature alteration of ultramafic grains and demonstrate that pore-scale imaging can directly link water-rock reaction kinetics, gas generation and multiphase flow behaviour in natural hydrogen systems."

      "summary": "Atomistic simulations generate large volumes of noisy structural data, but extracting phase labels, order parameters (OPs), and defect information in a way that is universal, robust, and interpretable remains challenging. Existing tools such as PTM and CNA are restricted to a small set of hand-crafted lattices (e.g.\\ FCC/BCC/HCP), degrade under strong thermal disorder or defects, and produce hard, template-based labels without per-atom probability or confidence scores. Here we introduce a log-probability foundation model that unifies denoising, phase classification, and OP extraction within a single probabilistic framework. We reuse the MACE-MP foundation interatomic potential on crystal structures mapped to AFLOW prototypes, training it to predict per-atom, per-phase logits $l$ and to aggregate them into a global log-density $\\log \\hat{P}_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{r})$ whose gradient defines a conservative score field. Denoising corresponds to gradient ascent on this learned log-density, phase labels follow from $\\arg\\max_c l_{ac}$, and the $l$ values act as continuous, defect-sensitive and interpretable OPs quantifying the Euclidean distance to ideal phases. We demonstrate universality across hundreds of prototypes, robustness under strong thermal and defect-induced disorder, and accurate treatment of complex systems such as ice polymorphs, ice--water interfaces, and shock-compressed Ti."

      "summary": "The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet a complete and conceptually transparent derivation has remained elusive. In this work, we derive the structure of ETH from a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP), together with general kinematic ingredients arising from entropy maximization, Hilbert-space geometry, and locality. ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable, with respect to local measurements, from states drawn from the Haar measure on a narrow microcanonical shell. Within this framework, diagonal ETH arises from concentration of measure, provided that eigenstate typicality holds. The structure of off-diagonal matrix elements is then fixed by entropic scaling and the finite-time dynamical correlations of local observables, with ETP serving as the dynamical bridge to energy eigenstates, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, Hilbert-space geometry, and chaos-induced eigenstate typicality, and clarify its regime of validity across generic quantum-chaotic many-body systems, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics."

The approach is to fix a natural spectral scale by letting the model normalization run with size, turning raw spectra into comparable, collapsed density curves. We demonstrate this approach on generalizations of two classic random matrix ensembles--Wigner and Wishart--modified to have power-law variance profiles. We use random matrix theory methods to derive self-consistent fixed-point equations for the resolvent to compute their eigenvalue densities, we define an RG scheme based on matrix decimation, and compute the Beta function controlling the RG flow as a function of the variance profile power-law exponent. The running normalization leads to spectral collapse which we confirm in simulations and solutions of the fixed-point equations. We expect this RG approach to carry over to other ensembles, providing a method for data analysis of a broad range of complex systems."

In this Letter, we propose an information-theoretic approach to decompose history dependence in systems with non-Markovian dynamics, quantifying the information encoded in dependencies of each order. In minimal models of non-Markovian dynamics, we show that this framework correctly captures the underlying historical dependencies, even when autocorrelations do not. In prolonged recordings of fly behavior, we find that the scaling of non-Markovian dependencies is invariant across timescales from fractions of a second to minutes. Despite this invariance, the overall amount of non-Markovian information is non-monotonic, suggesting a unique timescale on which historical dependencies are strongest."

Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects."

The relationship between orbital degrees of freedom and crystal chirality has also been intensively investigated, although the distinction from gyrotropic properties has not been fully clarified. In this work, we investigate spin and orbital Edelstein effects as well as the nonlinear responses in the ternary transition-metal chalcogenide Cu$_2$WSe$_4$, which has a gyrotropic but achiral crystal structure. We find that in the Edelstein effect, magnetization is dominated by the orbital contribution rather than the spin contribution. On the other hand, both the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric (NCTE) Hall effect--a response to the cross product of the electric field and the temperature gradient--and the nonlinear Hall effect--conventional second-order response to the electric field--are found to be dominated by the Berry curvature dipole. We further find that spin-orbit coupling plays only a minor role in these effects, whereas the orbital degrees of freedom are essential. Finally, we demonstrate that the orbital magnetic-moment contributions to both the Edelstein effect and the NCTE Hall effect are closely linked to chirality, and we discuss the possibility of using them as a chirality indicator."

Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials."

      "summary": "Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties."

In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative (phase rigidity) information supercurrents, analogous to a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically and empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and superconductivity."

However, the gradient noise introduced by SGD is often assumed to be uncorrelated over time, despite the common practice of epoch-based training where data is sampled without replacement. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate the effects of epoch-based noise correlations on the stationary distribution of discrete-time SGD with momentum. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we calculate the exact autocorrelation of the noise during epoch-based training under the assumption that the noise is independent of small fluctuations in the weight vector, revealing that SGD noise is inherently anti-correlated over time. Second, we explore the influence of these anti-correlations on the variance of weight fluctuations. We find that for directions with curvature of the loss greater than a hyperparameter-dependent crossover value, the conventional predictions of isotropic weight variance under stationarity, based on uncorrelated and curvature-proportional noise, are recovered. Anti-correlations have negligible effect here. However, for relatively flat directions, the weight variance is significantly reduced, leading to a considerable decrease in loss fluctuations compared to the constant weight variance assumption. Furthermore, we present a numerical experiment where training with these anti-correlations enhances test performance, suggesting that the inherent noise structure induced by epoch-based training may play a role in finding flatter minima that generalize better."

A simple model exhibiting this physics is the transverse-field Ising model, which can host a topological defect that performs the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. When acting on one point in space, this duality defect imposes the duality twisted boundary condition and binds a single zero mode. This zero mode is unusual as it lacks a localized partner in the same $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector and has an infinite lifetime, even in finite systems. Using Floquet driving of a closed Ising chain with a duality defect, we generate this zero mode in a digital quantum computer. We detect the mode by measuring its associated persistent autocorrelation function using an efficient sampling protocol and a compound strategy for error mitigation. We also show that the zero mode resides at the domain wall between two regions related by a Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. Finally, we highlight the robustness of the isolated zero mode to integrability- and symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our findings provide a method for exploring exotic topological defects, associated with noninvertible generalized symmetries, in digitized quantum devices."

We use the CSS chain complex and its tensor product with other chain complexes to describe the topological structure in the foliated cluster state, and argue that it has a symmetry-protected topological order protected by generalized global symmetries supported on cycles in the foliated CSS chain complex. We demonstrate the so-called anomaly inflow between CSS codes and corresponding foliated cluster states by explicitly showing the equality of the gauge transformations of the bulk and boundary partition functions defined as functionals of defect world-volumes. We show that the bulk and boundary defects are related via measurement of the bulk system. Further, we provide a procedure to obtain statistical models associated with general CSS codes via the foliated cluster state, and derive a generalization of the Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality for such statistical models with insertion of twist defects. We also study the measurement-assisted gauging method with cluster-state entanglers for CSS/fracton models based on recent proposals in the literature, and demonstrate a non-invertible fusion of duality operators. Using the cluster-state entanglers, we construct the so-called strange correlator for general CSS/fracton models. Finally, we introduce a new family of subsystem-symmetric quantum models each of which is self-dual under the generalized Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality transformation, which becomes a non-invertible symmetry."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared drug protection. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile, spatially structured settings. Migration, space, fluctuations, and environmental variability all have a significant impact on the development and proliferation of AMR. While drug resistance is enhanced by migration in static conditions, this changes in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. Here, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment. This contains a toxin against which protection can be shared (cooperative AMR). Cells migrate between demes and connect them. When the environment and the deme composition vary on the same timescale, strong population bottlenecks cause fluctuation-driven extinction events, countered by migration. We investigate the influence of migration and environmental variability on the AMR eco-evolutionary dynamics by asking at what migration rate fluctuations can help clear resistance and what are the near-optimal environmental conditions ensuring the quasi-certain eradication of resistance in the shortest possible time. By combining analytical and computational tools, we answer these questions by determining when the resistant strain goes extinct across the entire metapopulation. While dispersal generally promotes strain coexistence, here we show that slow-but-nonzero migration can speed up and enhance resistance clearance, and determine the near-optimal conditions for this phenomenon. We discuss the impact of our findings on laboratory-controlled experiments and outline their generalisation to lattices of any spatial dimension."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: While the microscopic laws of physics are often symmetric under time reversal, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. It can also be used to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system. Finally, we design a feedback-driven continuous measurement engine powered by the energy pumped into the system by the monitoring process. We show the engine can operate under experimentally realizable conditions with feedback delay and finite-efficiency measurements."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We consider the matrix composite materials (CM) of either random (statistically homogeneous or inhomogeneous), periodic, or deterministic (neither random nor periodic) structures. CMs exhibit linear or nonlinear behavior, coupled or uncoupled multi-physical phenomena, locally elastic, weakly nonlocal (strain gradient and stress gradient), or strongly nonlocal (strain-type and displacement-type, peridynamics) phase properties. A modified Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) approach introduces an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE) for CMs of any structure and phase properties mentioned above. The unified iteration solution of static AGIEs is adapted to the body force with compact support serving as a fundamentally new universal training parameter. The approach also establishes a critical threshold for filtering out unsuitable sub-datasets of effective parameters through a novel Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill's classical framework. This RVE concept eliminates sample size, boundary layer, and edge effects, making it applicable to CMs of any structure and phase properties, regardless of local or nonlocal, linear or nonlinear. Incorporating this new RVE concept into machine learning and neural network techniques enables the construction of any unpredefined surrogate nonlocal operators. The methodology is structured as a modular, block-based framework, allowing independent development and refinement of software components. This flexible, robust AGIE-CAM framework integrates data-driven, multi-scale, and multi-physics modeling, accelerating research in CM of any microtopology and phase properties considered. The AGIE-CAM framework represents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the micromechanics of composites, redefining the very philosophy that underpins our understanding of their behavior at the microscopic level."

For the Verlinde symmetry of a bosonic diagonal RCFT, we find that additivity is violated whenever the symmetry algebra contains an invertible element, while Haag duality is violated whenever it contains a non-invertible element.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We uncover a class of inter-species topological phases in a one-dimensional lattice, loaded with two species of non-identical particles interacting via a dynamical gauge field (DGF). Two types of topological states are found to emerge from different inter-species topology activated by the DGF. Specifically, edge confined states with co-localization of both species arise from an extrinsic inter-species topology, which can be decomposed into the single-particle topology for each species. On the other hand, bulk bound states with extended distribution emerge from an intrinsic inter-species topology that cannot be understood from single-particle ones. The two classes of inter-species topology are found to be independent of each other, characterized by different sets of inter-species topological invariants. Thus, their topological states can coexist in certain parameter regimes and compete with each other, leading to distinguished dynamical signatures. We further propose a feasible cold-atom realization of our model to demonstrate experimental accessibility of inter-species topological phases. Our work establishes inter-species topology as a new organizing principle of topological matter, revealing how correlations between distinct particle species can generate topological phenomena beyond single-particle paradigms."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO$_2$) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO$_2$ interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in Hahn-echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin relaxation with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Probing forces, deformations and generally speaking the mechanical properties of cells is the hallmark of mechanobiology. In the last two decades many techniques have been developed to this end that are largely based on deforming the cells and measuring the reaction force. In cells, an alternative approach has been implemented mid 2010's, based on Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) that produces a spectrum that can be interpreted as the response of the sample to an infinitesimal uniaxial compression at picosecond timescales. In all of these measurements, the response of the cell is quantified with a colloquial \"stiffness\" that encompasses both the contribution of load-bearing structures and volume changes, much to confusion. To clarify the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that BLS shift alone is mostly sensitive to water content while the additional analysis of the linewidth allows identifying the contribution of the biopolymer-based network dynamics in living cells."

Overall, we find that no existing model achieves strong generalization across all tasks: even the top-performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x higher than in-distribution. Current chemical foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation, while models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. We perform extensive ablation experiments, highlighting how data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation impact OOD performance.

Matchgates are essentially the single particle basis transformations in the Majorana fermion representation which can be easily handled classically, while the Clifford circuits can be efficiently simulated using the tableau method according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. In this work, we propose a new wave-function ansatz in which matrix product states are augmented with the combination of Matchgates and Clifford circuits (dubbed MCA-MPS) to take advantage of the representing power of all of them. Moreover, the optimization of MCA-MPS can be efficiently implemented within the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Our benchmark results on one-dimensional hydrogen chain show that MCA-MPS can improve the accuracy of the ground-state calculation by several orders of magnitude over MPS with the same bond dimension. This new method provides us a useful approach to study quantum many-body systems. The MCA-MPS ansatz also expands our understanding of classically simulatable quantum many-body states."

Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios.

The partition function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on background fields.

Additionally, it is also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions.

Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems."

Here, we report the first observation of chiral SF originating from edge states in large-area (>100 um * 100 um) vertically aligned chiral perovskite superlattices at room-temperature. Theoretical quantum optics calculations describe the transition from initially unpolarized, incoherent spontaneous emission to a coherent chiral SF state, quantitatively reproducing both the experimentally observed generation of circular polarization (up to ~14%) and its reversal in sign with opposite material handedness. Moreover, we show that both the intensity and the degree of circular polarization of chiral SF can be modulated by a weak magnetic field, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings demonstrate an interplay between chirality and many-body quantum coherence, thereby revealing promising new directions for chirality-controlled quantum-optical applications."

The metal-to-insulator transition in this material has therefore been one of the most studied phenomena in condensed matter physics, and has been revisited with considerable profit each time a new fabrication technology has been introduced. Here we take advantage of recent advances in creating ultra-thin layers of Bohr-atom-like dopants to realize the two-dimensional disordered Hubbard model at half-filling and its metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) as a function of mean distance between atoms. We use gas-phase dosing of dopant precursor molecules on silicon to create arsenic and phosphorus $\\delta$-layers as thin as 0.4~nm and as dilute as 10$^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$. On approaching the insulating state, the conventional weak localization effects, prevalent at high dopant densities and due to orbital motion of the electrons in the plane, become dominated by electron-electron interaction contributions which obey a paramagnetic Zeeman scaling law. The latter make a negative contribution to the conductance, and thus cannot be interpreted in terms of an emergent Kondo regime near the MIT."

For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \\approx n \\ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\\epsilon$, after only $2n \\ln(n \\epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach to improve correctness in LLMs, however, in many scientific problems, the objective is not necessarily to produce the correct answer, but instead to produce a diverse array of candidates which satisfy a set of constraints. We study this challenge in the context of materials generation. To this end, we introduce PLaID++, an LLM post-trained for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We find that performance hinges on our crystallographic representation and reward formulation. First, we introduce a compact, symmetry-informed Wyckoff text representation which improves computational efficiency and encourages generalization from physical priors. Second, we demonstrate that temperature scaling acts as an entropy regularizer which counteracts mode collapse and encourages exploration. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\\sim$50\\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials."

We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines.

A first cooling stage based on a blue shielded magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 6.8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\\mu$K and reaching a density of $\\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 min. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms."

Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems."

First, we establish a decomposition theorem, proving that any such projection-valued map admits a splitting into two projection-valued maps that are related to each other via time-reversal symmetry. Second, we provide a complete homotopy classification theorem for these maps, thereby clarifying their topological structure. Third, by means of the previous analysis, we connect the Fu-Kane-Mele index to the Chern number of one of the factors in the previously-mentioned decomposition, which in turn allows to exhibit how the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued topological obstruction to constructing a periodic and smooth Bloch frame for the projection-valued map, measured by the Fu-Kane-Mele index, can be concentrated in a single pseudo-periodic Kramers pair."

In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation."

By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics."

We show that this dual-front behavior arises naturally in systems governed by a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Using the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model as our primary example, we demonstrate that this coexistence is essential for understanding a wide array of unconventional dynamical effects, including abrupt ``non-Hermitian reflections'', sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets seeded by the small initial tails. We present analytic predictions that closely match numerical simulations. These results may offer new insight into the topology of non-Hermitian systems and point toward measurable experimental consequences."
