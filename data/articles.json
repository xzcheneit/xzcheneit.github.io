Therefore, the correct prediction of the crystal system is essential to estimate the properties of cathodes. This study applies machine learning classification algorithms for predicting the crystal systems, namely monoclinic, orthorhombic, and triclinic, related to Li P (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, V) O based Phosphate cathodes. The data used in this work is extracted from the Materials Project. Feature evaluation showed that cathode properties depend on the crystal structure, and optimized classification strategies lead to better predictability. Ensemble machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Gradient Boosting Machines have demonstrated the best predictive capabilities for crystal systems in the Monte Carlo cross-validation test. Additionally, sequential forward selection (SFS) is performed to identify the most critical features influencing the prediction accuracy for different machine learning models, with Volume, Band gap, and Sites as input features ensemble machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (80.69%), Extremely Randomized Tree (78.96%), and Gradient Boosting Machine (80.40%) approaches lead to the maximum accuracy towards crystallographic classification with stability and the predicted materials can be the potential cathode materials for lithium ion batteries."

Here, we demonstrate an all-in-plane alternative by \"nanosculpting\" ~100 nm-wide channels into thin films of FeTe0.75Se0.25/Bi2Te3 (FTS/BT), a candidate topological superconductor, with a Si++ focusses ion beam (FIB). Systematic irradiation shows that increasing the ion dose, while keeping the beam energy constant, progressively suppresses both the critical temperature (Tc) and critical current (Ic), confirming the creation of a controllable weak link even though a Fraunhofer interference pattern is not observed. Kelvin prove force microscopy , atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy corroborate the structural and electronic modification of the irradiated region. Ic (B) measurements reveal a slower field-induced decay of Ic at higher doses, indicating that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning centers that mitigate vortex motion and associated dissipation, By tuning beam energy and dose, the process shifts from SC-N-SC regime toward a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SC-I-SC) geometry, offering a simple scalable pathway to JJ fabrication. These results established FIB pattering as a versatile platform for engineering robust, scalable fault-tolerant qubits."

      "summary": "In frustrated magnetic systems with a subextensive number of classical ground states, quantum zero-point fluctuations can select a unique long-range ordered state, a celebrated phenomenon referred to as \\emph{order by quantum disorder} (ObQD). For frustrated spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ systems, unbiased numerical methods able to expose ObQD are necessary. We show that ObQD can be identified from exact diagonalization (ED) calculations through an analysis akin to the Anderson tower of states associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. By defining an effective quantum rotor model, we describe the competition between ObQD-induced localization of the rotor and its tunneling between symmetry-related ground states, identifying the crossover lengthscale from the finite-size regime where the rotor is delocalized, to the infinite system-size limit where it becomes localized. This rotor model relates the characteristic splittings in the ED energy spectrum to the ObQD selection energy scale, providing an estimate that can be compared to spin wave calculations. We demonstrate the general applicability of this approach in one-, two- and three-dimensional frustrated spin models that exhibit ObQD."

      "summary": "In clean two-dimensional (2D) systems, electrons are expected to self-organize into a regular lattice, a Wigner crystal, when their mutual Coulomb repulsion overwhelms kinetic energy. Understanding the Wigner crystal at zero magnetic field is a long-sought goal in physics, thanks to its fundamental simplicity and possible connection to the density-driven metal-insulator transition. To date, evidence for such a crystal has been reported across various platforms. However, the AC conductivity of a zero-field Wigner crystal, a key observable characterizing its electrodynamics, has never been measured. Here, we develop an ultrasensitive on-chip terahertz (THz) spectroscopy technique to probe the AC conductivity in electrostatically gated monolayer MoSe2 encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observe a sub-THz resonance corresponding to the pinning mode of a zero-field Wigner crystal, whose frequency is orders of magnitude higher than those under high magnetic fields. Using the pinning mode as an indicator, we reveal that moderate disorder notably stabilizes the Wigner crystal. With increasing density towards melting, we find that the pinning mode of the Wigner crystal coexists with a growing Drude component characteristic of an electron liquid, and the competition between these two components in the conductivity spectra leads to the insulator-metal transition of the 2D electron system. Our findings not only elucidate the low-energy electrodynamics of a zero-field Wigner crystal, but also establish on-chip THz spectroscopy as a powerful probe for correlated quantum phases in two-dimensional materials."

      "summary": "Broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in superconductors can induce not only spontaneous magnetization by the finite angular momentum of Cooper pairs, but also anomalous thermal Hall effects (ATHEs), whose detection has been extremely challenging. Here we report the successful observation of an ATHE developing below the superconducting transition temperature at zero magnetic field in the kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5. This finding is verified by the absence of a signal in a conventional type-II superconductor using the same setup and by ruling out the trapped-vortex effects through micro-Hall array measurements. Remarkably, both the temperature dependence and the magnitude of the observed anomalous thermal Hall conductivity are quite different from those expected for the quantized thermal edge current of an intrinsic ATHE, but consistent with extrinsic impurity-induced ATHEs in chiral superconductivity. Our study of ATHE offers an alternative approach to probe TRS breaking in the superconducting states."

      "summary": "The properties of films assembled by drying colloidal-particle suspensions depend sensitively on both the particles and the processing conditions, making them challenging to engineer. In this work, we develop and test an inverse-design strategy based on surrogate modeling to identify conditions that yield a target film structure. We consider a two-component hard-sphere colloidal suspension whose designable parameters are the particle sizes, the initial composition of particles, and the drying rate. Film drying is simulated approximately using Brownian dynamics. Surrogate models based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) and Chebyshev polynomial interpolation are trained on a loss function, computed from the simulated film structures, that guides the design process. We find the surrogate models to be effective for both approximation and optimization using only a small number of samples of the loss function. The GPR models are typically slightly more accurate than polynomial interpolants trained using comparable amounts of data, but the polynomial interpolants are more computationally convenient. This work has important implications not only for designing colloidal materials but also more broadly as a strategy for engineering nonequilibrium assembly processes."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets offer a promising platform for pushing skyrmion technology to the single-layer limit with high tunability. While Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is often recognized as central to skyrmion formation, their stability, collapse, and topological transition in 2D materials remain largely unexplored. In particular, the effect of higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) on these phenomena is unknown. Here, using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we report a new topological transition generated by HOI, which we term 'ferric transition', in single-layer MnSeTe. Surprisingly, skyrmion stability and collapse remain largely unaffected by HOI due to the dominant role of DMI near the saddle point, whereas the Bloch point is strongly modified, giving rise to this novel transition. This mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the well-known radial and chimera transitions. Moreover, we predict that Janus MnSeTe exhibits remarkably high skyrmion energy barriers due to its strong DMI, among the highest reported for intrinsic 2D magnets. Our findings unveil an unexpected role of HOI in skyrmion topological transitions and establish Janus MnSeTe as a robust platform for 2D skyrmionics."

      "summary": "Low dimensional quantum fluids, where one can probe the effects of enhanced thermal and quantum fluctuations on macroscopic quantum wavefunctions, can be experimentally realized through transverse physical confinement of superfluid helium on scales smaller than the coherence length. Reaching this scale is difficult, requiring confinement in single or multiple pores with nanometer radii. Porous silicates such as MCM-41 have a pore radius larger than the coherence length of 4He, and in this work we systematically explore the possibility of pre-plating pores with different elements to reduce the pore size without localizing the confined superfluid. Through a direct solution of the few-body Schrodinger equation combined with quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we explore the behavior of helium confined inside cylindrical nanopores for a range of pre-plating elements, including rare gases and alkali metals. For rare gases, we find that helium remains strongly attracted to the pore walls and any atoms in the core form an incompressible liquid. For alkali metals such as Cs, weak interactions between helium and the pre-plating material prevent localization near the walls and enable delocalization in the pore center. Our results extend previous results for helium wetting on flat two dimensional coated substrates to the curved geometry inside nanopores, and demonstrate that alkali pre-plated nanopores may enable a tunable one-dimensional confined quantum liquid of helium."

      "summary": "Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation."

Using DyScO3 as a model perovskite, we compare spatial resolution, spectral fidelity, and artifact suppression across scan modes. Ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieve atomic resolution and remain robust to large jumps in probe position. In contrast, atomic-resolution EELS maps show pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Finally, spiral scanning applied under cryogenic conditions in BaTiO3 thin films improves dose uniformity and mitigates drift related distortions. These results establish practical guidelines for the implementation of programmable scan strategies in low-dose 4D-STEM and highlight the inherent resilience of ptychography to trajectory-induced artifacts."

Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin qubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schr\\\"odinger treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions, wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify \"sweet spots\" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near $B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing spin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design guidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV semiconductors."

Among these, particle-hole excitations form a particularly important class, as they govern fundamental processes such as screening, dissipation, and transport. In metals, the continuum of electron-hole excitations is described by the Lindhard function. Although central to the theory of Fermi liquids, the corresponding Lindhard continuum has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report its direct observation in the weakly correlated metal MgB$_{2}$ using ultra-soft resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). We resolve a linearly dispersing excitation with velocity comparable to the Fermi velocity and find quantitative agreement with simulations of the non-interacting charge susceptibility. A detailed analysis and decomposition of the simulations reveal the intra-band origin of this low-energy excitation, confirming it as the Lindhard continuum. Our results establish ultra-soft RIXS as a momentum-resolved probe of the fermiology in metals and call for deeper investigations of continuum features in RIXS and related spectroscopy of other materials beyond MgB$_{2}$."

Although many methods, such as alloying, external electric field, Janus engineering, ferroelectric field and spin ordering, have been proposed to achieve fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, these approaches either face experimental difficulties or produce a small spin-splitting or are volatile. Here, we propose to form vertical heterostructures by stacking two different but equally magnetized two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials. If an A-type antiferromagnetic ordering is satisfied, a fully compensated ferrimagnet can be formed. This vertical heterostructure approach is insensitive to lattice matching and stacking manner, thus being more conducive to experimental realization. Through first-principles calculations, we verify our proposal with several examples, focusing in particular on $\\mathrm{CrI_3}$/$\\mathrm{CrGeTe_3}$ heterojunction composed of experimentally synthesized $\\mathrm{CrI_3}$ and $\\mathrm{CrGeTe_3}$ monolayers. The calculations show that $\\mathrm{CrI_3}$/$\\mathrm{CrGeTe_3}$ is a fully-compensated ferrimagnet, with pronounced spin-splitting, and that tensile strain is more favorable for achieving fully-compensated ferrimagnetism. Our work provides an experimentally feasible strategy for realizing fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, thereby further advancing the development of this field."

Using a Green's function formalism, we investigate Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interactions between two localized spins mediated by a two-dimensional electron gas arising from two spin-polarized bands with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and altermagnetic dispersion. We analyze two distinct regimes: (a) strong out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, and (b) weak in-plane order. For out-of-plane magnetization, the Heisenberg, Ising, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange interaction terms exhibit oscillatory spatial modulations and asymptotically decay as $1/R^{2}$ with impurity separation. Besides, all exchange terms display beating-like patterns that can be tuned via the exchange coupling strength between conduction electrons and ferromagnetic ordering. The DM vector lies within the two-dimensional plane, with the DM interaction being odd in the RSOC strength, oscillatory, and increasing in magnitude with RSOC strength. In contrast, it is even in the out-of-plane Zeeman field strength and oscillatory. Furthermore, the Heisenberg interaction exhibits a non-linear dependence on the altermagnetic band parameter. In the case of weak in-plane order, the Heisenberg exchange interaction shows a non-linear dependence on the in-plane exchange coupling strength."

      "summary": "The ordering of magnetic or electric dipoles leading to real-space topological structures is at the forefront of materials research as their quantum mechanical nature often lends itself to emergent properties. Atomic lattice vibrations (phonons) are often a key contributor to the formation of long-range dipole textures based on ferroelectrics and impact the properties of the emergent phases. Here, using monochromated, momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (qEELS) with nanometer spatial resolution and meV-spectral-precision, we demonstrate that polar vortex lattices in PbTiO$_3$ spatially modulate the material's vibrational spectrum in patterns that directly reflect the overlying symmetry of the topological patterns. Moreover, by combining experiments with molecular dynamics simulations using machine learned potentials we reveal how these structures modify phonon modes across the vibrational spectrum. Beyond simple intensity modulation, we find that the chirality of the vortex topology imparts its unique symmetry onto phonons, producing a distinctive asymmetrical spectral shift across the vortex unit cell. Finally, the high spatial resolution of the technique enables topological defects to be probed directly, demonstrating a return to trivial PbTiO$_3$ modes at vortex dislocation cores. These findings establish a fundamental relationship between ferroelectric-ordering-induced topologies and phonon behavior, opening new avenues for engineering thermal transport, electron-phonon coupling, and other phonon-mediated properties in next-generation nanoscale devices."

Here, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots. We find that the TLFs are susceptible to pulse heating. The amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on the distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also generally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that electrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We hypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could mitigate the heating."

      "summary": "Disorder is an intrinsic feature of all solids, from crystals of atoms to superlattices of colloidal nanoparticles. Unlike atomic crystals, in nanocrystal superlattices a single misplaced particle can affect the positions of neighbors over long distances, leading to cumulative disorder. This elusive form of collective particle displacement leaves clear signatures in diffraction, but little is known about how it accumulates and propagates throughout the superlattice. Here we rationalize propagation and accumulation of disorder in a series of CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices by using synchrotron grazing incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals of colloidal softness S in the range of 0.3-0.7 were obtained by preparing particles with different sizes and ligand mixtures, consisting of oleic acid and primary amines of variable lengths. Most diffraction patterns showed clear signatures of anisotropic disorder, with multilayer diffraction characteristics of high structural coherence visible only for the {100} axial directions and lost in all other directions. As the softness decreased, the superlattices transitioned to a more ordered regime where small-angle diffraction peaks became resolution-limited, and superlattice multilayer diffraction appeared for the (110) diagonal reflections. To rationalize these anisotropies in structural coherence and their dependence on superlattice softness, we propose a sinusoidal displacement model where longitudinal and transverse displacements modulate nanocrystal positions. The model explains experimental observations and advances the understanding of disorder in mesocrystalline systems as they approach the limits of structural perfection."

In this study,using first-principles approaches,the electronic configurations and the possible transitions are comprehensively investigated. Based on the calculated carrier cross sections and transition rates,the mechanism of the EL of NV centers and the charge-state dynamics are revealed. The continuous EL is maintained by the cycle of NV0 ground (GNV0),NV+ metastable (MNV+) and NV0 excited state (ENV0). The weaker EL intensity compared to photoluminescence (PL) is explained by the bottleneck transition from MNV+ to ENV0 and another non-luminescent transition cycle. Additionally,our results also explain the disappearance of the luminescence of NV- as a result of unbalanced transitions between NV- and NV0. This study not only reveal the mechanism of electroluminescence of NV centers and explain experimental observations,but also provide first-principles insights to understand the charge-dynamics of other color centers under electric and optical field."

Here we use discrete element method simulations to study the fine particle percolation velocity, $v_p$, and velocity fluctuations, $v_{rms}$, for $7 \\le R \\le 50$ and a range of $e_n$ and $\\mu$. Increasing $e_n$ increases velocity fluctuations and reduces percolation velocity. Increasing $\\mu$ decreases $v_{rms}$ but its influence on $v_p$ varies with $v_{rms}$, decreasing $v_p$ for low $v_{rms}$ and increasing $v_p$ for high $v_{rms}$. Although the influence of size ratio is weaker, larger values of $R$ increase both $v_p$ and $v_{rms}$. We also assess the influence of different excitation mechanisms, specifically using static, randomly excited, and sheared beds, finding that an inverse correlation between $v_p$ and $v_{rms}$ persists across all cases and is well-described by the Drude model, where increased scattering reduces mobility, when $v_{rms}$ is large. However, for weakly excited particles with low $v_{rms}$, the Drude analogy breaks down. In this regime, we introduce a staircase-inspired model that accounts for the gravitationally dominated percolation behavior. These findings provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms governing percolation dynamics in porous media and granular systems."

At $\\nu_{\\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state.

The non-collinearity of spin texture gives rise to non-relativistic spin splitting and the associated intrinsic Berry curvature. The integral of the latter over the Brillouin zone becomes nontrivial for non-coplanar (canted) non-collinear spin order even without explicit on-site or transfer spin-orbit coupling. That gives rise to a nonzero (scalar) spin chirality, and a record value for the Chern number of $C=\\pm 5$ can appear when the Fermi level is in an appropriate gap for isotropic electron hopping integrals, or nearly isotropic ones. The numerical results for this topological quantum anomalous Hall effect are supported by an analytical formula. It is possible to split the $C=\\pm 5$ plateau into different possible nonzero values for the Chern number by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transitions between Hall plateaus can be driven by flipping the Zeeman-like exchange field or controlling the onsite energies, alluding to the potential of this system to quantum information."

To this end, we demonstrate the accuracy of a general machine learning framework on a representative and challenging application: predicting the mass activity of Pt nanoparticles for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, estimated via a microkinetic model. Accurate models are obtained when leveraging either a nanocatalyst's structure representation accessible at the computational level, namely the surface site generalized coordination number distributions, or one accessible experimentally, namely the nanoparticle's pair distance distribution function. Building on this result, we demonstrate that our machine learning model, in tandem with Bayesian optimization, efficiently identifies the Top-10 and Top-100 most active structures out of a large pool of candidates comprising more than 50000 different structures, after probing the activity only of a few thousand structures. These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated theoretical and experimental identification of active nanocatalysts."

The FeV/Nb series shows a clear increase in Gilbert damping with the Nb sink thickness, attributed to spin pumping from FeV to Nb. Surprisingly, the FeV-Ni/Nb series exhibits no such damping increase, revealing no significant spin or orbital pumping from Ni to Nb. Our results offer a fresh perspective on angular-momentum transfer in Ni-based heterostructures, suggesting that the interpretation of some strong orbitronic effects may require further consideration."

Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based closure relation trained on a dataset of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of homopolymer melts and solutions. PRISM theory with the ML closure outperforms traditional atomic closures (e.g., Percus-Yevick) in predicting the structure of typical coarse-grained model systems. We also use the ML closure to accurately model the results of small-angle neutron scattering experiments. This ML-enhanced PRISM theory can therefore enable rapid soft materials discovery and design efforts."

In this work we consider the case of two transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers separated by a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer or multilayer. The hBN layers suppress tunneling between the TMD layers so that phase coherence is spontaneous when it is present. When twisted, the hBN layers also form a ferroelectric moir\\'e pattern that applies opposite triangular-lattice modulation potentials to the two TMD layers. We show via mean-field theory that at total hole filling per moir\\'e unit cell $\\nu=1$, this geometry can favor a chiral p-wave exciton condensate state in which the quantum anomalous Hall effect coexists with counter-flow superfluidity. We present a mean-field phase diagram for TMD hole bilayers modulated by twisted hBN, discuss the conditions needed for the realization of the p-wave condensate state, and propose experiments that could confirm its presence."

The elongation of the Ag-Se bond under tensile strain weakens the orbital coupling between Ag-$d$ and Se/Te-$p$ orbitals and reduces the band energy at the A point, which aligns the valence band and achieving a high band degeneracy. Concurrently, the weaker Ag-Se/Ag-Te bond under a small tensile strain leads to lower phonon group velocity and strong three- and four phonon scatterings, leading to lower $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$. Our first-principles calculations combined with electron-phonon coupling analysis as well as phonon and electron Boltzmann transport equations show that applying a 3\\% (2\\%) tensile strain can enhance the PF along the $c$-axis of ScAgSe$_2$ (TmAgTe$_2$) by 243\\% (246\\%) at a carrier concentration of 3$\\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ and reduce the $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ by 37\\% (26\\%) at 300 K. Consequently, 2 $\\sim$ 4 times of $ZT$ enhancement is obtained by 3\\% or 1\\% tensile strain in ScAgSe$_2$ (TmAgTe$_2$) at 300 K, achieving a maximum $ZT$ of 3.10 (3.62) at 800 K. Our material design strategy based on molecular orbital analysis reveals an effective route to boosting TE performance, and can be extended to other systems as well."

Below $T\\rm_{N}$ = 1.08 K, the anisotropic behavior of magnetic susceptibilities reveals that the Gd$^{3+}$ moments exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic coupling along the $c$-axis, while displaying a ferromagnetic arrangement in kagome plane. With pronounced magnetic frustration, in adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration experiments starting from initial conditions of 9 T and 2 K, Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ polycrystal reaches a minimum temperature of 0.151 K, significantly lower than its $T\\rm_{N}$. Due to the high density of Gd$^{3+}$ ions ($S$=7/2), the maximum magnetic entropy change reaches over 50 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ under fields up to 7 T in Gd$_3$BWO$_9$, nearly 1.5 times as large as commercial sub-Kelvin magnetic coolant Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$(GGG). The H-T phase diagram of Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ under $H$//$c$ exhibits field-induced critical behavior near the phase boundaries. This observation aligns with the theoretical scenario in which a quantum critical point acts as the endpoint of a line of classical second-order phase transitions. Such behavior suggests the importance of further investigations into the divergence of magnetic Gr\\\"uneisen parameter in the vicinity of critical field at ultralow temperatures."

      "summary": "The paper presents a survey of some dynamical transitions in nonequilibrium trapped Bose-condensed systems subject to the action of alternating fields. Nonequilibrium states of trapped systems can be realized in two ways, resonant and nonresonant. Under resonant excitation, several coherent modes are generated by external alternating fields, whose frequencies are tuned to resonance with some transition frequencies of the trapped system. A Bose system of trapped atoms with Bose-Einstein condensate can display two types of the Josephson effect, the standard one, when the system is separated into two or more parts in different locations or when there are no any separation barriers, but the system becomes nonuniform due to the coexistence of several coherent modes interacting with each other, which is termed internal Josephson effect. The mathematics in both these cases is similar. We concentrate on the internal Josephson effect. Systems with nonlinear coherent modes demonstrate rich dynamics, including Rabi oscillations, Josephson effect, and chaotic motion. Under Josephson effect, there exist dynamic transitions that are similar to phase transitions in equilibrium systems. The bosonic Josephson effect is shown to be realizable not only for weakly interacting systems, but also in superfluids, with not necessarily weak interactions. Sufficiently strong nonresonant excitation can generate several types of nonequilibrium states comprising vortex germs, vortex rings, vortex lines, vortex turbulence, droplet turbulence, and wave turbulence. Nonequilibrium states can be characterized and distinguished by effective temperature, effective Fresnel number, and dynamic scaling laws."

Open questions remain regarding the behavior of dislocations concerning their stability under strong externally applied electric fields. In this study, we investigate the dielectric breakdown strength of nominally undoped SrTiO3 crystals after the introduction of high-density dislocations. The dislocation-rich samples are prepared using the Brinell scratching method, and they consistently exhibit lower dielectric breakdown strength as well as a larger scatter in the breakdown probability. We also study the impact of electric field on the introduction and movement of dislocations in SrTiO3 crystals using Brinell indentation coupled with an electric field of 2 kV/mm. No changes on the dislocation plastic zone size, depth, and dislocation distribution are observed under this electric field. Based on the charge state of the dislocations in SrTiO3 as well as the electrical and thermal conductivity modified by dislocations, we discuss the forces induced by the electric field to act on the dislocations to underline the possible mechanisms for such dislocation behavior."

In this work, the effects of QAC models incorporating replicas with additional interactions, specifically, the penalty spin model and the stacked model, are investigated for problems characterized by a small energy gap between the ground and first excited states during quantum annealing, a well-known bottleneck to reaching the ground state. The results demonstrate that these QAC models can obtain the optimal solution within short annealing times by exploiting diabatic transitions, even for problems with a small energy gap. These findings highlight the potential of QAC models as practical near-term algorithms for hardware subject to runtime limitations and control noise."

The magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 with its strong spin-orbit coupling, intrinsic ferromagnetism, and kagome lattice of correlated electrons, provides a compelling platform for studying impurity excited states. Yet, the role of intrinsic impurities in shaping its quantum states remains elusive. Here, we uncover intrinsic quantum clusters-localized intrinsic point defects that act as tunable quantum perturbations capable of reshaping electronic states and order parameters, on the surface of Co3Sn2S2 via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non contact atomic force microscopy, combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy. These clusters are identified as native oxygen defects that dominate the intrinsic defect landscape on both cleaved surface terminations. On the Sn-terminated surface, oxygen impurities occupy hollow sites between three Sn atoms, and tune the flat band near the Fermi level, which exhibits orbital magnetism induced unconventional Zeeman effect under an applied magnetic field. On the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials reside slightly off center relative to the S lattice and generate occupied impurity states that retain sixfold symmetry at higher energies but reduce to C2 symmetry at lower energies. In contrast, these impurity states show no measurable magnetic response. Our findings establish that intrinsic oxygen-related quantum clusters act as tunable local perturbations in a topological kagome magnet, offering a versatile platform to probe and engineer impurity-driven phenomena in correlated and topological systems."

      "summary": "Medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) such as CoCrFeNi and CoCrNi are promising structural materials owing to their outstanding mechanical and thermal properties, which arise from complex chemical disorder and atomic-scale interactions. Although density functional theory (DFT) has provided fundamental insights into these systems, its high computational cost limits exploration of large-scale phenomena. Classical interatomic potentials have been used to address this gap but often lack the fidelity needed to capture many-body interactions and chemical short-range ordering (CSRO) effects. In this work, we developed a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to bridge accuracy and efficiency. The MTP was trained on a comprehensive DFT database spanning unary to quaternary configurations and reproduces energies, forces, and stresses with near-DFT accuracy across diverse structural and chemical environments. It accurately predicts elastic properties and recovers compositional trends in bulk and shear moduli in agreement with DFT. Hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations capture CSRO, reproducing key DFT-reported features including Cr-Cr and Fe-Fe repulsion and Ni-Cr ordering. Stacking fault energetics were modeled, yielding ISF energies near 54 mJ/m2 for CoCrNi and 36 mJ/m2 for CoCrFeNi, consistent with DFT predictions. Local chemical environment effects on stacking faults were also resolved: Co-rich planes reduce, whereas Cr- or Fe-rich planes increase, the stacking fault energy. By enabling large-scale, high-fidelity simulations at a fraction of DFT's cost, the developed MTP provides a robust framework for predictive modeling of thermodynamic stability, defect behavior, and mechanical response of FCC MEAs."

Here, through the ultra-low temperature magnetism and thermodynamic characterizations, we unveil the large magnetocaloric effect (MCE) realized at sub-Kelvin temperatures in the frustrated Kagome antiferromagnet Gd3BWO9 with TN~1.0 K. The isothermal magnetization curves indicate the existence of field (B) induced anisotropic magnetic phase diagrams, where four distinct magnetic phases for B // c-axis and five magnetic phases for B // ab-plane are identified at T< TN. The analysis of magnetic entropy S(B, T) data and direct adiabatic demagnetization tests reveal a remarkable cooling performance at sub-Kelvin temperatures featured by a large volumetric entropy density 502.2 mJ/K/cm3 and a low attainable minimal temperature Tmin~168 mK from the initial cooling condition of 2 K and 6 T, surpassing most of Gd-based refrigerants previously documented in temperature ranges of 0.25-4 K. The realized Tmin~168 mK far below TN ~ 1.0 K in Gd3BWO9 is related to the combined effects of magnetic frustration and criticality-enhanced MCE, which together leave a substantial magnetic entropy at reduced temperatures by enhancing spin fluctuations."

The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between three values $v,0,-v$ at exponential times, thus incorporating positive tumble times. Moreover, a constant drift is added to the run-and-tumble motion at all times. The combination of these two features constitutes the main novelty of our model. The densities of the first-passage time through $a$ (given the initial position and velocity states) satisfy certain forward Fokker--Planck equations. The Laplace transforms of these equations induce evolution equations for the exit probabilities and the mean first-passage times of the particle. We solve these equations explicitly for all possible initial states. We consider the limiting regimes of instantaneous tumble and/or the limit of large $b$ tend to infinity to confirm consistency with existing results in the literature. In particular, in the limit of a half-line (large $b$), the mean first-passage time conditioned on the exit through $a$ is an affine function of the initial position if the drift is positive, as in the case of instantaneous tumble."

Conventional optimization of thermodynamic cost based on optimal transport theory leaves room for varying the final distributions according to the intended task, enabling further optimization. Taking advantage of this freedom, we use Lagrange multipliers to derive the optimal final distribution that minimizes the thermodynamic cost. Our framework applies to a wide range of thermodynamic tasks, including particle transport, thermal squeezing, and information processing such as information erasure, measurement, and feedback.

      "summary": "Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using 2D nanomaterials has emerged as a sophisticated approach to mitigate industrial CO2 emissions. In this work, the potential application of pristine as well as strategically Fe, Co, Ni-doped 2D AlSb was examined as a CO2RR electrocatalyst. The recation pathways of CO2RR intermediate complexes, overpotential, stability, efficiency, and selectivity were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Outstanding overpotentials were achieved with pristine and doped 2D AlSb: Ni-doped 2D AlSb was selective for HCOOH (0.12eV) and CH4 (0.28eV), and Fe-doped 2D AlSb for HCHO (0.31eV) and CH3OH (0.31eV). The opposing effects of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was mitigated with the application of electric potential and solution pH. The main reasons for the enhancement of catalytic effect due to doping with Fe, Co, and Ni are bandgap reduction and creation of states at the edge of the valence band due to the 3d orbitals of these dopants. Interestingly, the Fe-doped 2D AlSb catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Excellent electrocatalytic properties of pristine and doped 2D AlSb make them suitable as CO2RR catalysts contributing towards a green and sustainable energy ecosystem."

      "summary": "Quantum Hall systems host quasiparticles demonstrating correlated electron physics and non-trivial quantum statistics. Excitonic phases, archetypical for interaction effect, have attracted significant interest in recent years in double-layer quantum Hall systems where spatially separated electrons and holes form bosonic condensate through Coulomb interaction. Here, employing the approach of quantum Hall antidot with two spatially separated edge channels, we demonstrate a new type of quantum Hall quasiparticle exciton which represents a quantum-coherent bound state of an electron and a hole situated on their corresponding edges coupled through intralayer tunneling and Coulomb interaction. Quantum-coherent dynamics of the exciton is reflected in the observed evolution of the position and magnitude of the antidot conductance peaks around the electron-hole resonance. The quantum Hall antidot setup allows localization and electrical tuning of individual quantum Hall excitons. Quantum superposition of vacuum- and electron-hole pairing states is observed through the gate-dependent tunneling conductance of the antidot. Modeling the electron-hole pair as a coupled two-level system, semi-quantitative understanding of experimental observations is achieved. This work opens avenues for creating quantum systems of multiple quantum Hall quasiparticles."

      "summary": "Silicon-based MAX phases are a promising class of layered ceramics with superior thermal and chemical stability. However, their synthesis remains challenging due to inherent thermodynamic instability at high temperatures. Herein, we develop a general top-down strategy to synthesize a broad family of Si-substituted MAX phases (M = Ti, V, Nb, Ta, Cr; X = C, N) by reacting Al-based MAX precursors with SiCl4 vapor. This approach not only circumvents traditional high-temperature limitations but also enables precise A-site defect engineering, resulting in phases with controlled vacancy concentrations (e.g., Nb2Si3/4C and Nb2Si1/2C). Furthermore, we introduce a redox potential-based model that rationalizes the reaction pathway. Using Tin+1AlXn etched with SiCl4 as an example, the process simultaneously forms Cl-terminated MXene (Mn+1XnCl2) and amorphous nano-Si, enabling the one-step synthesis of Si-coated MXene composites. This methodology provides new avenues for designing advanced MAX phases and MXene-based hybrids with tailored functionalities for applications in energy storage and catalysis."

      "summary": "Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on chains of Co adatoms on Cu surfaces, we investigate the physics of a spin-$3/2$ Heisenberg chain with single-ion anisotropy ($D$) on metallic and semi-metallic surfaces. In the strong Kondo coupling ($J_k$) limit, a perturbative analysis maps the system onto a Haldane spin-1 chain with single-ion anisotropy, ferromagnetically coupled to the metallic surface. This Haldane state, arising from underscreening of the $S=3/2$ chain, is stable against small $D$ and characterized by topological edge modes. The nature of the $D$-driven transitions out of this state depends on the environment. Coupling to a metal (semi-metal) is a relevant (irrelevant) perturbation at the decoupled fixed point between the spin-1 chain and the two-dimensional electron gas. In the large positive $D$ limit, the system maps onto an anisotropic spin-$1/2$ Kondo system. For large negative $D$, in the Ising phase, spins are frozen. For small $J_k$, the nature of the metallic phase dominates. On a two-dimensional semi-metal, the Kondo coupling is irrelevant at the decoupled fixed point ($J_k= 0$), leading to a Kondo breakdown phase at weak coupling, irrespective of $D$. In contrast, on a two-dimensional metal, the resulting dissipative Ohmic bath is a marginally relevant perturbation, inducing antiferromagnetic ordering along the chain. In this case, $D$ drives a spin-flop transition between Ising and XY ordered phases. At $D=0$, we observe continuous transitions between the Kondo breakdown or dissipation-induced long-range ordered phases and the underscreened Haldane phase. These phase diagrams are supported by scaling arguments and sign-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations."

Taking position and orientation as kinematic variables, we examine the conservation of the linear and angular momentum variables in an elementary volume. We find that nonreciprocal interactions yield, in addition to the areal stresses and moment stresses of classical elasticity, volumetric forces and torques that act as local sources of momentum and angular momentum. Since, by symmetry, these can only depend on the strains, nonreciprocity requires the extension of constitutive modeling to strain-dependent volumetric forces and torques. Using Cartan's method of moving frames and Curie's principle, we derive the materially linear constitutive law that underpins the nonreciprocal, geometrically nonlinear elasticity of the continuum. We study this constitutive law exhaustively for a one-dimensional active solid and identify striking nonreciprocal effects - traveling waves, linear instabilities, spontaneous motion of and about the center of mass - that are absent in a passive, reciprocally interacting solid. Numerical simulations of a particulate active solid model, consisting of a linear assembly of hydrodynamically interacting active particles, yields long-wavelength behavior that is in excellent agreement with theory. Our study provides the foundation for a principled macroscopic mechanics of oriented active solids with symmetry-invariant, nonreciprocal microscopic interactions."

Building on this segmentation, we develop a geometric analysis pipeline based on skeletonization, graph mapping, and spline fitting, which quantifies local stripe propagation through length and curvature measurements. Applying this framework to 444 images from 12 annealing protocol trials, we analyze the transition from the \"quenched\" state to a more parallel and coherent \"annealed\" state, and identify two distinct evolution modes (Type A and Type B) linked to field polarity. Our results provide a quantitative analysis of geometric and topological properties in magnetic stripe patterns and offer new insights into their local structural evolution, and establish a general tool for analyzing complex labyrinthine systems."

The present work explores how hyperfine coupling within the Tm ions in TmVO$_4$ single crystals affects an electronic ferroquadrupole ordered ground state and its associated field-tuned quantum phase transition. For temperatures below the hyperfine energy scale, the nuclear moments reduce the critical field for the electronic order, resulting in a dramatic back-bending of the phase boundary delineating the ferroquadrupole order. This behavior is well described by a single-ion semiclassical mean-field model. Moreover, analysis of the effective Hamiltonian leads to a prediction of spontaneous nuclear magnetic order mediated by 4$f$ electrons, which in principle persists with the application of orthogonal antisymmetric strain, yielding a proposed electro-nuclear tetracritical point."

We find that the VBS state and an antiferromagnetic ground state with magnetization $m=0$ are degenerate for $S=3/2$ and $S=2$ by using the Lanczos method and the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG). However, increasing $S$, the magnetization of the ground states is uniquely determined as the fraction $m=(S-1)/S$. This is not just a ferromagnet, but a quantum ferromagnet due to quantum entanglement inherent in VBS states. In the low-energy excitation spectrum, we find the coexistence of the Haldane gap and Goldstone-like ferromagnetic magnon excitation. This ``magnetic chimera'' clearly appears under a finite magnetic field. Finally, we discuss an application to the measurement-based quantum computation and an extension of the Haldane's conjecture."

By mapping the Meissner effect, we visualized superconducting regions and revealed sample inhomogeneities. Our combined magnetic and electrical measurements on the same crystal provide dual evidence of superconductivity, supporting the high-temperature superconductivity of La3Ni2O7-delta.

      "summary": "Understanding and controlling the atomic structure of polar oxide surfaces is essential for unraveling surface reactivilty and designing advanced catalytic materials. Among these, the polar CeO2(100) surface is a prototypical and industrially important system in heterogeneous catalysis. However, due to the vast complexity of the surface configurations, its reconstruction behavior remains an open question. Here, we report a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO2(100) surface, discovered through an integrated approach that combines global structure search algorithms, machine learning-based atomic potential models, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The reconstructed surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable, characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. Importantly, the formation of localized Ce3+ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied electronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates the O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H2O. These findings reveal a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism by which surface reconstruction governs electronic structure and reactivity, offering critical insights and a new design strategy for tuning catalytic performance on polar oxide surfaces."

We show that resetting disrupts the inherent time correlation, inducing Markovianity, thereby leading to an efficient escape mechanism.

Here, by combining operando interferometric imaging with electrokinetic measurements, we directly visualize voltage-induced blistering of the confining walls of two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels, as key origin of memristive hysteresis. We identify two distinct classes of blisters: unidirectional, driven by electrostatic forces on surface charges, and bidirectional, arising from osmotic pressure due to concentration polarization. This mechanistic framework explains device evolution and device-to-device variability, and reframes stochastic blistering as a functional design element. Our results constitute a direct proof of electromechanical coupling as a robust pathway to ionic memory in 2D nanochannels and open routes toward high-performance ionic memristors and electrically actuated nanofluidic valves."

In the classical case, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a minimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved in the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed within a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is observed that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat released, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this is a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time memory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the field of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to the two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However, the potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover, the two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in structure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the success rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released associated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier partitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving the efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the thermodynamic costs."

      "summary": "The magnetic and crystal structures of manganese and nickel monoxides have been studied by high-resolution neutron diffraction. The known 1$k$-structures based on the single propagation vector $\\left[\\tfrac{1}{2}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right]$ for the parent paramagnetic space group $Fm\\bar{3}m$ are forced to have monoclinic magnetic symmetry and are not possible in rhombohedral symmetry. However, the monoclinic distortions from the rhombohedral $R\\bar{3}m$ metric allowed by symmetry are very small, and the explicit monoclinic splittings of the diffraction peaks have not been experimentally observed. We analyze the magnetic crystallographic models metrically compatible with our experimental data in full detail by using the isotropy subgroup representation approach, including rhombohedral solutions based on the propagation vector star $\\left\\{ \\left[\\tfrac{1}{2}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right],\\ \\left[-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right],\\ \\left[\\tfrac{1}{2}\\ -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right],\\ \\left[\\tfrac{1}{2}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right] \\right\\}$. Although the full star rhombohedral $R\\bar{3}c$ structure can equally well fit our diffraction data for NiO, we conclude that the best solution for the crystal and magnetic structures for NiO and MnO is the 1$k$-monoclinic model with the magnetic space group $C_c2/c$ (BNS 15.90, UNI symbol $C2/c.1'_c[C2/m]$)."

      "summary": "Altermagnetic properties have been recently proposed in polar magnetic oxides, M$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), where improved characteristics of stronger magnetoelectric coupling and higher magnetic transition temperatures were observed. Thus, understanding their microscopic origins is of fundamental and technological importance. However, the difficulty in growing large single crystals hinders detailed experimental studies. Here, we report the successful growth of large single crystals of the pyroelectric antiferromagnet using two representative compounds, Fe$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ and NiZnMo$_{3}$O$_{8}$. Growth was optimized using various parameters, finding the transport agent density as a primary factor, which depends strongly on the position of the pellet, the starting powder form, and the volume of the ampule. We demonstrated a controlled growth method by manipulating the convection and diffusion kinetics. High-quality crystals were characterized by using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Laue diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and Raman spectroscopy. Manipulation of magnetic properties through nonmagnetic Zn doping was shown in NiZnMo$_{3}$O$_{8}$. Our results enable the detailed investigation and manipulation of their unconventional altermagnetic and multiferroic properties. This study provides crucial insight into the controlled growth of other functional quantum materials."

The advent of altermagnets -- antiferromagnets with unconventional spin-group symmetries -- creates new opportunities in this evolving field. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast laser-induced switching in altermagnetic $\\alpha$-MnTe that orchestrates the concerted dynamics of charge, lattice, and spin degrees of freedom. Time-resolved reflectivity and birefringence measurements reveal that the transient melting of spin order is accompanied by pronounced structural and electronic instabilities, as evidenced by phonon nonlinearity and accelerated band gap shrinkage. Theoretical modeling highlights the key roles of robust magnetic correlations and spin-charge coupling pathways intrinsic to this altermagnet."

      "summary": "The moir\\'e superlattice system provides an excellent platform for exploring various novel quantum phenomena. To theoretically tackle the diverse correlated and topological states emerging from moir\\'e superlattices, one usually adopts an effective low-energy continuum model based on which the electron-electron effects are further considered. However, the construction of an accurate continuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moir\\'e superlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work, we develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in principle applicable for arbitrary moir\\'e superlattices and are extrapolatable to any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic properties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain invariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external inputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the coupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition enables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model using a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we design a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density functional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer MoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately reproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures, charge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist angles. Furthermore, the model extrapolates robustly to smaller twist angles. Our work not only provides a more precise understanding of the microscopic properties of moir\\'e superlattices, but also lays a foundation for future theoretical studies of low-energy electronic properties in generic moir\\'e superlattice systems."

The quantum metric, which is a component of the QGT and takes complex values in non-Hermitian systems, generates an intrinsic nonlinear conductivity independent of the scattering time, while the complex Berry curvature induces a wavepacket-width-dependent response. Using one-dimensional and two-dimensional non-Hermitian models, we establish a universal link between nonlinear dynamics and the QGT, thereby connecting quantum state geometry to observable transport phenomena. Crucially, our analysis indicates that the wavepacket width significantly affects non-Hermitian transport -- a feature absent in Hermitian systems. This framework unifies non-Hermitian response theory by revealing how geometric degrees of freedom encode transport in open and synthetic quantum matter. Our results bridge fundamental quantum geometry with emergent functionality, offering pathways to exploit geometric effects in topological devices and engineered materials."

The ground state hosts three distinct phases-phase-separated, polarized, and phase-mixed-determined by the Rabi coupling, interaction ratio G (between inter-component and intra-component interactions), and spin-twisting which induces edge-localized polarization through position-dependent detuning. In the phase-mixed regime, the ground state is characterized by a finite spin-scissors susceptibility and can be accurately described using local density approximation. In the dynamics, the system exhibits stable periodic beating in the phase-mixed state for G 1, its evolution progresses from beat damping (phase-separated state) to polarized relaxation (polarized state), finally reaching stable periodic beating (phase-mixed state) after a finite waiting time. The dependence of the waiting time contrasts sharply with the monotonic behavior of one-dimensional spin-dipole dynamics, revealing qualitatively distinct mechanisms governed by geometry and interactions. In summary, these results establish a unified link between ground-state properties and nonequilibrium responses in twisted spinor condensates, offering a versatile platform for exploring spin-related quantum many-body phenomena."

Instead of assuming idealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a variational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical formalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical averages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the parameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive learning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact replica calculations are not feasible."

This model, which differs from that obtained using only high-$Q$ data, quantitatively reproduces the observed intensities, including the $(000)$ zeroth-order magnetic satellites that are especially sensitive to subtle components of the modulation. While a contribution from itinerant electrons to the zeroth satellite cannot be definitively excluded, our analysis reveals no unambiguous evidence for such effects within experimental uncertainty. The refined magnetic structures exhibit topologically nontrivial winding patterns, derived from the fitted magnetic parameters, that support localized, particle-like spin textures with half-integer topological charges. These features provide a natural microscopic origin for the observed topological Hall effect, establishing CeAlGe as a model system where magnetism and topology are intimately linked."

The use of a \"harder\" pseudopotential with semicore electrons has a direct impact on the short-range interactions, which in turn has implications on the radiation damage simulations. We find that despite these differences, the average threshold displacement energy is quite similar (40-50 eV for Ni). However, we find significant differences in the cumulative damage predicted by massively overlapping cascade simulations and compare them with Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy/channeling experiments. We also investigate approaches to modify the repulsive pair interactions after training the potentials and discuss the feasibility of such approaches."

The materials investigated include archetypal molecular architectures as well as mixtures showing room-temperature ferroelectric phases. The measured values, which range from 0.3 to 20 pm/V, are here reasonably predicted by combining calculations of molecular-level hyperpolarizabilities and a simple nematic potential, highlighting the opportunities of modelling-assisted design for enhanced NLO ferroelectric fluids."

      "summary": "Copolymers are highly versatile materials with a vast range of possible chemical compositions. By using computational methods for property prediction, the design of copolymers can be accelerated, allowing for the prioritization of candidates with favorable properties. In this study, we utilized two distinct representations of molecular ensembles to predict the seven different physical polymer properties copolymers using machine learning: we used a random forest (RF) model to predict polymer properties from molecular descriptors, and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the same properties from 2D polymer graphs under both a single- and multi-task setting. To train and evaluate the models, we constructed a data set from molecular dynamic simulations for 140 binary copolymers with varying monomer compositions and configurations. Our results demonstrate that descriptors-based RFs excel at predicting density and specific heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) and volume (Cv) because these properties are strongly tied to specific molecular features captured by molecular descriptors. In contrast, graph representations better predict expansion coefficients ({\\gamma}, {\\alpha}) and bulk modulus (K), which depend more on complex structural interactions better captured by graph-based models. This study underscores the importance of choosing appropriate representations for predicting molecular properties. Our findings demonstrate how machine learning models can expedite copolymer discovery with learnable structure-property relationships, streamlining polymer design and advancing the development of high-performance materials for diverse applications."

In 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers lacking inversion symmetry, phonons with a given chirality can be observed in the non-equilibrium state triggered by optical excitations using circularly polarized light. Backed by first-principles calculations, we present the antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnPS$_3$ with a hexagonal crystal structure and bandstructure similar to TMDCs, but a larger unit cell, as a novel candidate material that may allow for excitation of circular phonons. Using DFT+U and the finite displacement method we obtain in-plane chiral phonon modes at the valley points of a monolayer MnPS$_3$. These modes can be classified according to the Mn or S atoms performing circular motions about their equilibrium positions. In each case, the quantized angular momentum of the phonons is calculated. Moreover, we point out ways to populate the chiral phonons selectively via optical excitation with circularly polarized light."

It has been expected that the integration of robotic systems into experimental materials science excels at efficiently performing repetitive and time-consuming tasks without the need for human intervention, thus significantly increasing throughput and reducing the risk of human error, while there have been a limited number of reports tackled the synthesis process of solid bulk material so far possibly because of the complex as well as a wide variety of processes to deal with. In this paper, we report an automated arc melting system controlled by a robot operating system2 (ROS2). Taking advantage of ROS2, we have constructed a machine that can handle multiple experimental apparatuses simultaneously with flexibility for future expansion of functions. The constructed machine is capable of not only performing repeated operation of a specific process but also dealing with multiple elements for synthesis of intermetallic compounds. The system is expected to accelerate experimental validation of data-driven materials exploration."

      "summary": "The macroscopic fluctuation theory is a powerful tool to characterise the large scale dynamical properties of diffusive systems, both in- and out-of-equilibrium. It relies on an action formalism in which, at large scales, the dynamics is fully determined by the minimum of the action. Within this formalism, the analysis of the statistical properties of a given observable reduces to solving the Euler-Lagrange equations with the appropriate boundary conditions. One must then compute the action at its minimum to deduce the cumulant generating function of the observable. This typically involves computing multiple integrals of cumbersome expressions. Recently, a simple formula has been conjectured to shortcut this last step, and compute the cumulant generating function of different observables (integrated current or position of a tracer) without the need to compute any integral. In this work, we prove this simple formula, and extend it to more general observables. We then illustrate the efficiency of this approach by applying it to compute the variance of a generalised current in the semi-infinite symmetric exclusion process and the joint properties of two occupation times in any diffusive system. In the case of the integrated current, our formula can be interpreted as a generalisation of Fick's law to obtain all the cumulants of the current beyond the average value."

The van der Waals interaction is shown to be crucial for determining the adsorption energy. Some electrons transfer from the substrate to the molecules upon surface adsorption, resulting in a reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$. Since the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of Mn$_{12}$ is close to the valence band of MoS$_2$, a negative electric field is more effective in modulating charge transfer and energy band alignment, and thus altering the magnetic anisotropy energy, compared with a positive electric field. A significant increase in the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$ with the ligand R=CHCl$_2$ or R=C$_6$H$_5$ under a sufficiently high electric field has been predicted. Our calculations show that the molecules remain intact on the surface both before and after the electric field is applied. Finally, a two-level system formed by different adsorption configurations is evaluated, and the tunability of its energy barrier under an electric field is demonstrated. Our study sheds light on tuning the properties of single-molecule magnets using an electric field, when the molecules are supported on a surface."

      "summary": "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is an important method for imaging beam sensitive materials often under cryo conditions. Electron ptychography in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has been shown to reconstruct low-noise phase data at a reduced fluence for such materials. This raises the question of whether ptychography or HRTEM provides a more fluence-efficient imaging technique. Even though the transfer function is a common metric for evaluating the performance of an imaging method, it only describes the signal transfer with respect to spatial frequency, irrespective of the noise transfer. It can also not well defined for methods, such as ptychography, that use an algorithm to form the final image. Here we apply the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence independent and sample independent measure of technique performance. We find that, for a weak-phase object, ptychography can never reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but that ptychography is more robust to partial coherence."

We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene."

In this work, we present a theoretical framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations and Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the structural relaxation behavior of small organic glass-formers. By using propanol, glucose, fructose, and trehalose as model systems, we estimate the glass transition temperature (Tg) from stepwise cooling simulations and volume-temperature analysis. These computed Tg values are then inserted into the ECNLE theory to calculate temperature-dependent relaxation times and diffusion coefficients. Numerical results agree well with experimental data in prior works. This approach provides a predictive and experimentally-independent route for characterizing glassy dynamics in molecular materials."

      "summary": "We propose an asymmetric-nanoconstriction (ANC) design of spin-Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) and investigate mutual synchronization of a pair of such devices using micromagnetic simulations. The ANC geometry enables strong dipolar coupling at sub-50 nm separations while preserving independent current bias for each oscillator. We first characterize the auto-oscillation of a single ANC-SHNO, revealing a broad frequency tuning range and a field-controlled crossover between negative and positive nonlinearities. We then demonstrate that two such oscillators can mutually synchronize solely via dipolar stray fields, without electrical or spin-wave coupling. Depending on the bias conditions, the coupled pair exhibits robust in-phase (0{\\deg}) or out-of-phase (180{\\deg}) locking. Notably, we find a bias-dependent amplitude correlation: when the oscillators sustain comparable amplitudes, both in-phase and out-of-phase synchronization are accessible, whereas amplitude imbalance drives the system into an out-of-phase state accompanied by suppression of the weaker oscillator. By combining strong conservative coupling with independent frequency and gain control, the ANC-SHNO platform provides a scalable route toward phased oscillator arrays, neuromorphic computing architectures, and experimental exploration of non-Hermitian spintronic dynamics."

Here, we investigate theoretically the pairwise and many-body interaction terms among skyrmions in helimagnets, considering both the ferromagnetic and conical spin backgrounds. Using micromagnetic simulations, we separate the exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and Zeeman contributions to the skyrmion-skyrmion pair potential, and show that the binding energy of skyrmions within the conical phase depends strongly on the film thickness. For small skyrmion clusters in the conical phase, three-body interactions make a substantial contribution to the cohesive energy, comparable to that of pairwise terms, while four-body terms become relevant only at small magnetic fields. As the system approaches the ferromagnetic phase, these higher-order contributions vanish, and the interactions become essentially pairwise. Our results indicate that realistic models of skyrmion interactions in helimagnets in the conical phase must incorporate many-body terms to accurately capture the behavior of skyrmion crystals and guide strategies for controlling skyrmion phases and dynamics."

Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations, which for spinful systems are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\\nu=\\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems."

We theoretically explore how the altermagnetic spin-splitting affects the thermoelectric quasiparticle current in AM-based superconducting heterostructures. Our setup comprises of a bilayer system where a $d$-wave AM is proximity coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor (SC). We calculate the thermoelectric current carried by the quasiparticles applying a finite thermal bias accross the junction. The behavior of the thermoelectric current with the system's base temperature and chemical potential is very similar to that in traditional SC heterostructures. Remarkably, the dissipative thermoelectric current found in the AM junction is spin-split and thus generates finite spin-polarization in the AM-based junction, which can approach $100\\%$ spin-polarization in the strong altermagnetic phase. We further investigate the thermoelectric current in AM-based Josephson junction (JJ) and illustrate how to achieve the diode effect in this AM-based JJ. The efficiency of our proposed thermoelectric diode reaches upto $\\sim 80\\%$ and changes its sign depending on the strength of the AM, enhancing the potential for spin-calotronics applications."

We collect text data in the case study of Flitzing, a tradition of emailing poem-like romantic invitations at Dartmouth College because of its richness in information. Across the three approaches, we obtain consistency in phase transition and clustering results, which also align with literature on the mathematics of transformers and metastability. Our work inspires utilizing spin glass theory for the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence, especially under environmental stochasticity from human interactions, with justification from real data."

This paper reports on the efficacy of such a framework as a generalizable methodology for calibrating material models against experimental data with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, this paper studies the effect of two manufacturing temperatures and three initial granular configurations on the unconfined compressive behavior of the resulting bonded granular materials. In each of these cases, the same calibration framework was used; in that, hundreds of high-fidelity direct numerical simulations using a new, GPU-enabled, high-performance finite element method software, Ratel, were run to calibrate a finite-strain phase-field fracture model against experimental data. It was found that manufacturing temperature influenced the elastic response of the mock high explosives, with higher temperatures yielding a stiffer response. By contrast, it was found that the initial configuration of the grains had a negligible impact on the overall behavior of the mock high explosives, though it remains possible that local damage accumulation within the specimens could be altered by the initial configurations. Overall, the calibration framework was successful at creating well-calibrated models, showing its usefulness as an engineering and scientific tool."

In the normal phase, the dynamics of charge-carrying fluids is constrained by the restrictive chemical shift symmetry, which locks charges to fixed positions in the comoving plane as they are transported through space by the fluid's motion. On the other hand, in the superfluid phase, the chemical shift symmetry is relaxed to a constant shift, allowing charges to redistribute freely across the comoving hypersurface. We demonstrate that both models recover the respective nonlinear hydrodynamic equations and provide explicit expressions for the collective variables of hydrodynamics in terms of the theory's fields. Introduced models provide a UV completion to the effective field theories of hydrodynamics constructed in terms of the Goldstone fields. Finally, we propose a relativistic fracton fluid phase as a natural interpolation between the normal and superfluid phases, in which the mobility of elementary charges is constrained by a linear shift symmetry in the comoving space."

Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain.

This paper critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g., LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems, currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems, while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the agent metaphor."

Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications of geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural models."

After initializing the spins to contain a single domain wall, we then expose it to quantum fluctuations by turning on the transverse Zeeman energy. We characterize the crossover between memory retention at low transverse field, and memory loss at high transverse field by extracting the Shannon information entropy of magnetic domain wall distributions.

      "summary": "We study the geometric phase accumulated during non-adiabatic charging of different driven open quantum systems serving as quantum battery models. We provide a full numerical analysis of dynamics under different type of noises typically reported in superconducting circuits implementations. We complement the study with analytic results derived in the limiting case of no noise (i.e. isolated systems). We compute the non-unitary geometric phase acquired by the quantum batteries during the transition and show that there is a direct relation between the accumulated geometric phase and the integral of the stored energy during the transition. Finally, we perform the same analysis on a bipartite quantum battery that relies on a dephased charger and found similar results. Our theoretical findings are within experimental reach using state-of-the-art techniques."

      "summary": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in general domains such as programming and writing, and have demonstrated strong potential in various scientific research scenarios. However, the capabilities of AI models in the highly specialized field of materials characterization and analysis have not yet been systematically or sufficiently validated. To address this gap, we present MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset specifically designed for material characterization techniques. MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), etc. We employ a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation to construct high-quality question-answer pairs, integrating both multiple-choice and subjective questions. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the most advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao Vision Pro 32K) have already achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis. The MatQnA dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/richardhzgg/matQnA."

Based on the numerical outcomes, we find that the phase transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22, 0.23,$ and 0.24 are second order and are governed by the 2D Ising universality class. In addition, we find evidence to support the facts that there are transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.5, 0.8$ and 1.0 and these phase transitions are second order. Our results also indicate phase transition is unlikely to take place for $g=0.3$. We are not able to obtain results for $J_2/|J_1|$ $\\in$ (0.24, 0.3) because the associated integrated autocorrelation times or (and) the equilibrium times are extremely large at the low-temperature region. A comparison between the outcomes presented here and the available results in the literature is briefly conducted as well."

      "summary": "We investigate a three-dimensional subsystem under a time-dependent U(1) gauge field coupled to rotationally invariant environments. To capture the dynamic behavior of the subsystem under thermal excitations and dissipations, it is imperative to treat the bath in a non-Markovian and nonperturbative manner. This is because quantum noise is constrained by the uncertainty principle, which dictates the relationship between the noise correlation time and the amplitude of the energy fluctuation. To this end, we derive the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) incorporating the gauge field, enabling a rigorous investigation of the dynamics of the reduced subsystem. Transforming the HEOM into the Wigner representation yields quantum hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations [U(1)-QHFPE] with U(1) gauge fields. These equations incorporate vector fields into the damping operators while preserving both gauge invariance and rotational symmetry. To demonstrate the practical use of the formalism, the effects of a heat bath in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring. Our investigation includes simulations of the equilibrium distribution, linear absorption spectra, and AB currents under thermal conditions. Within a rotationally invariant system-bath (RISB) model, we predict the emergence of a persistent current even in dissipative environments, provided the bath is non-Markovian and the temperature is sufficiently low. We also assessed the validity of the Caldeira-Leggett model in this context."

      "summary": "Simulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories in nature is challenging with classical methods, but is a promising application for quantum computers. Unfortunately, simulating interacting bosonic fields involves a high boson-to-qubit encoding overhead. Furthermore, when mapping to qubits, the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosons is necessarily truncated, with truncation errors that grow with energy and time. A qubit-based quantum computer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic, and mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for simulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a hybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in the internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states. Specifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa model, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure fermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities. These dynamics populate high bosonic-field excitations starting from an empty state, and the experimental results capture well such high-occupation states. This simulation approaches the regime where classical methods become challenging, bypasses the need for a large qubit overhead, and removes truncation errors. Our results, therefore, open the way to achieving demonstrable quantum advantage in qubit-boson quantum computing."

Here, $z = {\\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $T > 0$, and $J \\in \\mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \\in (0,\\infty)$ and $z \\in (0,\\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \\in (0,\\infty)$ and fixed $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J > 0$ or equivalently $t \\in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J < 0$ or equivalently $t \\in (1,\\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two. These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by M\\\"uller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results."

      "summary": "This paper explores a novel connection between a thermodynamic and a dynamical systems perspective on emergent dynamical order. We provide evidence for a conjecture that Hamiltonian systems with mixed chaos spontaneously find regular behavior when minimally coupled to a thermal bath at sufficiently low temperature. Numerical evidence across a diverse set of five dynamical systems supports this conjecture, and allows us to quantify corollaries about the organization timescales and disruption of order at higher temperatures. Balancing the damping-induced phase-space contraction against thermal exploration, we are able to predict the transition temperatures in terms of the relaxation timescales, indicating a novel nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, and formally connecting the thermodynamic and dynamical systems views. Our findings suggest that for a wide range of real-world systems, coupling to a cold thermal bath leads to emergence of robust, non-trivial dynamical order, rather than a mere reduction of motion as in equilibrium."

However, achieving nanoscale spatial resolution remains a challenge since employing gradiometry to overcome electrostatic screening causes resolution-limiting trade-offs including the averaging effect and the sensor-sample proximity. Here, we demonstrate a scanning NV center protocol that achieves an enhanced spatial resolution of approximately 10 nm. We develop an axially symmetric probe with a sub-nanometer oscillating amplitude, which simultaneously provides robust intermittent-contact mode feedback and ensures close engagement between the diamond tip and the sample. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a 10 nm spatial resolution on ferroelectric lithium niobate. Scanning NV center electrometry with this resolution can directly resolve the nanoscale polar textures and dynamics of emerging ferroelectrics, which commonly arise on the scale of tens of nanometers."

We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states.

Our approach integrates density-functional theory, data augmentation strategies and classical molecular dynamics to systematically explore the potential energy landscape. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against true errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of our active learning strategy, which is shown to minimize both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to relabel with ab initio calculations. The method is validated on the fully automated training of a NNIP for a diverse set of carbon allotropes, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency.

Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moir\\'e potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moir\\'e-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moir\\'e potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moir\\'e-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies."

      "summary": "Spin ensembles are central to quantum science, from frequency standards and fundamental physics searches to magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum sensing. Their performance is ultimately constrained by spin projection noise, yet solid-state implementations have so far been limited by much larger photon shot noise. Here we demonstrate a direct, quantum non-demolition readout of a mesoscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that surpasses the photon shot-noise limit and approaches the intrinsic spin projection noise. By stabilizing the $^{14}$N nuclear spin bath at high magnetic fields and employing repetitive nuclear-assisted spin readout, we achieve a noise reduction of 3.8 dB below the thermal projection noise level. This enables direct access to the intrinsic fluctuations of the spin ensemble, allowing us to directly observe the signatures of correlated spin states. Our results establish projection noise-limited readout as a practical tool for solid-state quantum sensors, opening pathways to quantum-enhanced metrology, direct detection of many-body correlations, and the implementation of spin squeezing in mesoscopic solid-state ensembles."

      "summary": "Open quantum systems can be approximately described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) and Lindbladians. The two approaches differ by quantum jump terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs -- multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels that serves as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds."

      "summary": "Electrically tunable linear dichroism (LD) with non-volatile properties represents a critical yet elusive feature for next-generation integrated photonic elements in practical device architectures. Here, we demonstrate record-breaking, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in two-dimensional ReS2 via ferroelectric gating with aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Our ferroelectric field-effect transistors achieve near-unity (~95%) LD tunability of differential reflectance at room temperature--the highest reported for any electrically controlled 2D optical system. Crucially, the programmed optical states exhibit exceptional retention exceeding 12,000 seconds without applied bias, enabling true non-volatile optical memory. Through combined experimental characterization and ab initio calculations, we reveal that ferroelectric polarization switching induces substantial asymmetric charge transfer to ReS2, selectively populating conduction band states and triggering structural distortions that dramatically enhance optical anisotropy in the \"up\" polarization state while leaving the \"down\" state unperturbed. This ferroelectric-semiconductor coupling provides a universal platform for voltage-programmable, energy-efficient photonic devices with dynamic polarization control, addressing critical needs in integrated photonics as well as programmable far-field optics and telecommunications infrastructure."

Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schr\\\"odinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter."

      "summary": "A key challenge in quantum complexity is how entanglement structure emerges from dynamics, highlighted by advances in simulators and information processing. The Lieb--Robinson bound sets a locality-based speed limit on information propagation, while the Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem gives a universal constraint on entanglement growth. Yet, SIE bounds only total entanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for R\\'enyi entanglement growth at $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling R\\'enyi entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend SIE and provide a unified framework that reveals the detailed structure of quantum complexity."

This system possesses an extensive number of instantaneous (adiabatic) stationary states which are coupled through non-adiabatic transitions. We analytically calculate the generator of the ensuing slow dynamics and analyze the creation of coherences through non-adiabatic processes. For a certain choice of the transverse field shape, we show that the system solely undergoes transitions among classical basis states after each pulse. The concatenation of many of such pulses leads to an evolution of the spin chain under a many-body dynamics that features kinetic constraints. Our setting not only allows for a quantitative investigation of adiabatic theorems and non-adiabatic corrections in a many-body scenario. It also directly connects to many-body systems in the focus of current research, such as ensembles of interacting Rydberg atoms which are resonantly excited by a slowly varying laser pulse and subject to dephasing noise."

From the fundamental symmetries and linear transformations of the microscopic action, we derive exact relations between the correlation functions and their generators.

One of the main results of this study is that the action can be split between an incompressible part, which is the same as in the usual stochastic Navier-Stokes theory whatever the value of the Mach number, and a longitudinal part, whose behavior is to be compared to the three dimensional Burgers equation, which presents a much richer phase diagram as its usually discussed one dimensionalcounterpart."

Advancement in this field depends critically on robust benchmarks and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation. This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a crystal structure prediction task$\\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains $\\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we find to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and split by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but with different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset which ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with the match rate metric."

      "summary": "The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system."

Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk graphite.These results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management."

Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single \"optimal\" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts."

      "summary": "The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure characterized by flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena, such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and an augmented tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations indicate that spin-orbit coupling in LK-99 generates multiple Weyl points near the Fermi level, thereby enhancing the Berry curvature distribution by further splitting the bands. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. The nonlinear Hall effect is solely due to the BCD, as the contributions from the Drude weight and quantum metric are zero due to time reversal symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices."

      "summary": "Nanopatterned magnetic thin films offer a platform for exploration of tailored magnetic properties such as emergent long-range order. A prominent example is artificial spin ice (ASI), where an arrangement of nanoscale magnetic elements, acting as macrospins, interact via their dipolar fields. In this study, we discuss the transition from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) long-range order in a square lattice ASI, as the magnetic elements are gradually rotated through 45{\\deg} to a \"pinwheel\" configuration. The AFM$\\unicode{x2013}$FM transition is observed experimentally using synchrotron radiation x-ray spectromicroscopy and occurs for a certain rotation angle of the nanomagnets, dependent on the dipolar coupling strength determined by the separation of the magnets in the lattice. Large-scale magnetic dipole simulations show that the point-dipole approximation fails to capture the correct AFM$\\unicode{x2013}$FM transition angle. However, excellent agreement with experimental data is obtained using a dumbbell-dipole model which better reflects the actual dipolar fields of the magnets. This model also explains the coupling dependence of the transition angle, another feature not captured by the point-dipole model. Our findings resolve a discrepancy between measurement and theory in previous work on \"pinwheel\" ASIs and establish the coupling dependence of the AFM-FM transition. The revised dipole model, with a more accurate representation of the stray field, offers more precise control of magnetic order in artificial spin systems."

      "summary": "Quantum free electrons, i.e. plane waves, with wavevector k, and occupancy constrained by the Pauli exclusion principle, are explained in all solid state physics texts. Although overly simplified, free-electron theory works surprisingly well for many properties of simple metals. For bulk materials, it is assumed that the sample is effectively infinite and that surfaces are irrelevant. Over the past 30 years, experiments that visualize surfaces and enable the study of 2-d materials have revolutionized solid state physics, stimulating new experiment, theory, and applications. Modified free electron models, adapted to films, have enabled modeling of electronic properties of films. This paper analyzes three such models: periodic boundary conditions, hard-wall boundary conditions, and soft-wall (SW) boundary conditions, in order of increasing realism. The SW case is illustrated for an aluminum film consisting of six atomic layers, comparing SW free-electron theory with a scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiment."

Despite the absence of surface charge on the channel walls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe a robust ion selectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip when the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to tip when the field direction is reversed. Additionally, we observe a corresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the electric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic flow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double layers. However, in uncharged tapered nanoslits, we uncover a novel mechanism for these phenomena, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the heterogeneous water polarization."

      "summary": "Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called quantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. We considerably develop the study of the topology of QCA, allowing us to classify static and driven ALT phases in low dimensions. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases) - which we also classify in low dimensions - and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states."

We reveal both spin polarization in bulk in the linear response and antiparallel spin polarization near the boundary in the quadratic response against electric fields, and reproduce the experimentally observed correlation between the chirality of the metal and the direction of spin polarization. In particular, we elucidate that the sign of the quadratic spin accumulation is opposite to that expected from the bulk spin current. This sign discrepancy originates from the dipole-like charge distribution appearing in the quadratic response. Our method is applicable to a wide range of real materials with various types of spin--orbit coupling."

In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains."

Here, we propose an orbital optomechanical (OOM) sensor that exploits the sensitive coupling of an orbitally squeezed $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate to spacetime distortions, enabling the detection of interferometer phase shifts induced by CWs. This sensor achieves a theoretical quantum-noise-limited sensitivity 16 dB below the SQL while reducing the required laser power by five orders of magnitude. The performance arises from a novel noise trade-off: a counter-propagating readout scheme suppresses photonic shot noise, while orbital squeezing minimizes the remaining atomic projection noise. By leveraging quantum control over atomic orbital degrees of freedom, this approach establishes a new framework for interferometric sensing with direct applications to the search for CWs and ultralight dark matter."

We propose a machine learning protocol with ternary classification of instantaneous spin configurations using known values of disordered phase energy and ordered phase energy. The trained neural network is used to predict whether a given sample belong to one or another phase of matter. This allows us to estimate for the first time the probability that configurations with a certain energy belong to the ordered phase, coexistence phase, and disordered phase. Based on these probabilities, we obtained estimates of the values of the critical energies and latent heat for the Potts model with 10 and 20 components, which undergoes a strong discontinuous transition. We also found that the probabilities may reflect geometric transitions in the coexistence phase."

      "summary": "Stripe order is a prominent feature in the phase diagram of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors. It has been confirmed as the lowest-energy state of the two-dimensional Fermi Hubbard model in certain parameter regimes. Upon increasing the temperature, stripes and the superconducting state give way to the enigmatic strange-metal and pseudogap regimes, whose precise nature remains a long-standing puzzle. Using modern tensor network techniques, we discover a crucial aspect of these regimes. Infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) simulations in the fully two-dimensional limit reveal a maximum in the charge susceptibility at temperatures above the stripe order. This maximum is located around filling $n=0.9$ and intensifies upon cooling. Using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) on finite cylinders, we attribute the enhanced charge susceptibility to the formation of charge clusters, reminiscent of phase separation where the system is partitioned into hole-rich and hole-depleted regions. In contrast to genuine phase separation, the charge cluster sizes fluctuate without a divergent charge susceptibility. Hence, while this precursor state features clustering of charge carriers, true phase separation is ultimately forestalled at lower temperatures by the onset of stripe order."

We study polaron and dimeron quasi-particle properties via variational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation. Moreover, we develop a determinant diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm for this problem based on expansion in bare on-site coupling $U$. This algorithm turns out to be sign-problem free at any filling of spin-up fermions, allowing one to sample very high diagram order (larger than $200$ in our study) and to do simulations for large $U/t$ (we go up to $U/t=-20$ with $t$ the hopping strength). Both methods give qualitatively consistent results. With variational Ansatz we go to even larger on-site attraction. In contrast with the continuum case, we do not observe any polaron-to-dimeron transition for a range of spin-up filling fractions $\\rho_{\\uparrow}$ between $0.1$ and $0.4$. % (away from the low-filling limit).

The availability of single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative dynamical descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change $\\unicode{x2013}$including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory$\\unicode{x2013}$ are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken."

While several studies indicate that structural disorder strongly influences the thermal conductivity, the fundamental physics governing the disorder-conductivity relation remains elusive. Here we show that order-of-magnitude, disorder-induced variations of conductivity in network solids can be predicted from a bond-network entropy, an atomistic structural descriptor that quantifies heterogeneity in the topology of the atomic-bond network. We employ the Wigner formulation of thermal transport to demonstrate the existence of a relation between the bond-network entropy, and observables such as smoothness of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and macroscopic conductivity. We also show that the smoothing of the VDOS encodes information about the thermal resistance induced by disorder, and can be directly related to phenomenological models for phonon-disorder scattering based on the semiclassical Peierls-Boltzmann equation. Our findings rationalize the conductivity variations of disordered carbon polymorphs ranging from nanoporous electrodes to defective graphite used as a moderator in nuclear reactors."

Here, a discussion is developed about constructing a heat-like engine in terms of the fluctuating diffusivity. The engine constitutes two kinds of processes with the average diffusivity or the average local temperature being kept fixed, along which the fluctuation distribution obeys an exponential law. The efficiency of the engine in a cycle, which quantifies how much the diffusivity change as the analog of work can be extracted, is found to formally coincide with that of Carnot's. During the cycle, the total change of the entropy is also shown to vanish."

      "summary": "Tunneling spectroscopy between parallel two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems provides a powerful method to probe the underlying electronic properties by measuring tunneling conductance. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for spin transport in 2D-to-2D tunneling systems, driven by spin pumping. This theory applies to a vertical heterostructure where two layers of metallic 2D electron systems are separated by an insulating barrier, with one layer exchange-coupled to a magnetic layer driven at resonance. Utilizing a non-perturbative Floquet-Keldysh formalism, we derive general expressions for the tunneling spin and charge currents across a broad range of driving frequencies, extending beyond the traditional adiabatic pumping regime. At low frequencies, we obtain analytical results that recover the known behaviors in the adiabatic regime. However, at higher frequencies, our numerical findings reveal significant deviations in the dependence of spin and charge currents on both frequency and precession angle. This work offers fresh insights into the role of magnetization dynamics in tunneling transport, opening up new avenues for exploring non-adiabatic spin pumping phenomena."

We study whether ALLs can lead to Fermi-surface like quantum oscillation in the absence of a zero-field Fermi surface. Focusing on two-dimensional multi-band low-energy models of electrons with continuous rotation symmetry, we show that an effective-band description, akin to the semiclassical treatment of Landau level problems in metals, can be used to predict the Landau level spectrum, including possible ALLs. This description then describes ALL induced quantum oscillation for certain insulating models, which we demonstrate through numerical calculations."

Using a symmetry-based nonlinear sigma model, we derive effective boundary conditions for the Usadel and Maxwell equations that account for the spin-galvanic effect, spin relaxation, and spin precession. This approach allows for the analysis of various interfaces without relying on specific microscopic models. We apply these boundary conditions to derive ISOC-induced terms in the Ginzburg-Landau functional, which is then used to compute the critical temperature of superconducting films with ISOC subjected to an external magnetic field. Our findings show that, contrary to a recent prediction, the critical temperature of a film cannot be enhanced by an external magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrate that the combination of ISOC and an external magnetic field leads to a superconducting diode effect. Its efficiency strongly depends on the interplay between the spin-galvanic and the spin relaxation terms. Our results provide a framework for understanding ISOC in superconducting systems and highlight the potential for optimizing diode efficiency through careful interface engineering."

Here, we propose and investigate theoretically how co-tunneling through Mott insulators enables direct access to the shadow band structure of GFZ. In particular, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the GFZ that is shown to govern the co-tunneling amplitude and reveal fingerprints of many-body correlations clearly distinguishing the GFZ structure from the underlying free Bloch band structure of the system. Our perturbative analytical results are corroborated by numerical data both in the framework of exact diagonalization and matrix product state simulations for a one-dimensional model system consisting of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model coupled to two single level quantum dots."

To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid density functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional density functional theory (DFT) and Hubbard-corrected DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials."

Injectable, depot-forming hydrogels enable sustained release of therapeutic agents by modulating macromolecular diffusion through dynamic polymer networks. However, achieving reliable control over release kinetics remains a challenge, as the injection process induces shear-mediated disruption of transient crosslinks, leading to an initial burst release that can cause local toxicity and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy designed to restore network structure post-injection through rapid reformation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling time-dependent regulation of diffusion properties. By tuning viscoelastic parameters, including stress relaxation time and network recovery rate, we reduced the extent of burst release without compromising sustained delivery. Using model protein cargo, we demonstrate in both $in~vitro$ and $in~vivo$ settings that hydrogels with faster crosslink reformation kinetics exhibit significantly lower early-phase release while maintaining long-term delivery comparable to unmodified formulations. These results establish a mechanistic framework for decoupling short- and long-term release behavior, offering a broadly applicable strategy for precise drug delivery in soft tissue environments."

We achieve multilevel programming of CrTe3 through both step-wise crystallization and step-wise amorphization using a hybrid opto-electronic device at various temperatures. Moreover, the application potential of CrTe3 in neuromorphic computing is testified by its incorporation in a vehicle with automatic path-tracking function.

While the DC magnetisation suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several Kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetisation and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a quantum-disordered ground state. We observe a spin glass transition around ~30 mK at zero field, arguably originating from a small fraction of free spins -- with an associated entropy of <3 % of the total $R\\ln2$, which is suppressed by an applied field of ~0.02 T. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K is indicative of short-range spin correlations. Below 350 mK, we observe a robust linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, accompanied by the complete absence of long-range order at low fields. We propose that a phenomenological theory, based on the interplay between spinons and thermally excited gauge flux excitations, can account for the linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, and could be widely applicable to similar critical quantum spin liquid candidate materials. The results establish the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe$_2$ as a prime candidate for field-tunable triangular quantum spin liquid behavior and highlight the importance of thermally excited gauge field excitations."

Specifically for complex systems with tunable parameters, these conditions for robust splitting (RS) are abundant, and by using multiple tunable parameters the relative amplitude and phase of the output signals can also be tuned. The splitting property of the systems works for all possible input phase differences and amplitude ratios and does not require a particular coherent input signal. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at RS conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the RS conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems and involves some degree of attenuation, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) and hold in generic complex scattering systems."

      "summary": "The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and the anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. We also provide three families of solutions that cover a broad range of cases. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to planar topological codes, extended string-net models, or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems."

Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we calculate the leading order asymptotics of the time-dependent distribution of the particle position, derive the most probable paths that reach the specified position at a given time and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean first-passage time, and show that the feedback accelerates dynamics by storing finite-time fluctuations, thereby lowering the effective energy barrier and shifting the optimal first-passage time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate the dynamics. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control first-passage dynamics."

In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches forming a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomenon is explained by a double-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O and V2Te2O/ZnSe/V2Te2O AMTJs. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit."

Based on this, the present work investigates the hydrogen storage on the sodium-decorated P-C$_3$N (Na@P-C$_3$N), a porous carbon nitride monolayer recently proposed as a stable semiconductor. First-principles calculations reveal that Na atoms preferentially adsorb with an adsorption energy of -4.48~eV, effectively suppressing clusterization effects. Upon decoration, the system becomes metallic, while \\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations confirm the thermal stability of Na@P-C$_3$N at 300~K. Hydrogen adsorption on Na@P-C$_3$N occurs through weak physisorption, with energies ranging from -0.18 to -0.28~eV, and desorption temperatures between 231 and 357~K. The system can stably absorb 16 H$_2$ molecules per unit cell, corresponding to a gravimetric storage capacity of 9.88~wt\\%, surpassing the U.S. Department of Energy target. These results demonstrate that Na@P-C$_3$N is a promising candidate for lightweight, stable, and reversible hydrogen storage."

      "summary": "In unconventional superconductors, inversion and/or time-reversal symmetries may be broken, either extrinsically or spontaneously. Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts an axionic superconducting state, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state."

We show that this thermodynamic paradox is resolved if the outcome of the random time is stored in a memory device. Specifically, we show that the average work required to erase the memory is always larger than the average work gained from the protocol. We also discuss concrete setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols."

The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a physical neuromorphic network device can be feasibly optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters."

The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation. Implications of the model for compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and electron doped oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ are discussed."

Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional (3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an external magnetic field, respectively."

We apply our framework to different models to compare the resulting phase diagrams: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. We show that the multi-sublattice structure is crucial for realizing the phase-modulated superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring this exotic superconductivity without external magnetic fields."

Here, we investigate heat dissipation in two classes of marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin dynamics: (i) diffusive criticality, which asymptotically manifests as scaled Brownian diffusion, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, which shows oscillation with diffusive amplitude. By analytical derivations, we find fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: the average heat dissipation rate asymptotically approaches a constant for diffusive criticality but diverges linearly with oscillations for oscillatory criticality, despite both showing linearly growing variance over time. We further numerically study the probability distributions of heat dissipation rates for both types of critical dynamics. Our results demonstrate that non-stationary time-delayed dynamics with similar scaling can yield qualitatively distinct heat dissipation behaviors, depending on the underlying dynamical details. This work provides a concrete foundation for future investigations into thermodynamic properties of general nonlinear time-delayed systems."

It begins with a brief history of DNA melting, which emerged alongside the growth of the field of molecular biology, juxtaposed with the advancements in physics during the same post-World War II period. The earlier theories of melting of DNA were based on the Ising model and its modifications, but gradually moved towards polymer-based models. The idea of force-induced unzipping was first introduced in 1999 as a cooperative mechanism for breaking base pairs without the need for temperature changes. The paper discusses several subsequent developments addressing different aspects of the unzipping transition."

In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters."

Describing this transport as diffusive gives anomalously high diffusivity, orders of magnitude higher than for regular diffusive exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures.

Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, that constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, like chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals that their design and optimization should prioritize molecular properties governing the information ratchet mechanism, rather than those influencing energetic bias."

In this formulation, the two generators should have the same eigenvalues $(-E)$ that may be complex, while the duality function $\\Omega(x,{\\tilde x})$ can be considered as a mapping between the right and the left eigenvectors of the two models. We describe how this spectral perspective is useful to better understand two well-known dualities between processes defined in the same configuration space: the Time-Reversal duality corresponds to an exchange between the right and the left eigenvectors that involves the steady state, while in the Siegmund duality, the left eigenvectors correspond to integrals of the dual right eigenvectors. We then focus on the famous Moment-Duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion on the interval $x \\in [0,1] $ and the Kingman Markov jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \\in {\\mathbb N}$ in order to analyze the relations between their eigenvectors living in two different configuration spaces. Finally, we discuss how the spectral perspective can be used to construct new dualities and we give an example for the case of non-degenerate real eigenvalues, where one can always construct a dual Directed Jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \\in {\\mathbb N}$, whose transitions rates are the opposite-eigenvalues."

Moreover, the electron band around the Brillouin-zone (BZ) boundary shows a replica structure with respect to the energy originating from plasmonic polarons due to electron-plasmon interactions. The different scattering effects and interactions in each atomic chain lead to asymmetric transport lifetimes of carriers: a large Seebeck coefficient can be realized even in a semimetal.

Here we report a striking exception, where an unconventional superconducting phase is stabilized by an out-of-plane magnetic field and coexists with a re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) effect in moir\\'e-less rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. The re-entrant quantum Hall state, arising from a bubble-like charge density wave (CDW), provides a natural backdrop for the emergence of superconductivity. Angle-resolved transport reveals that the field-stabilized superconducting phase occupies the same density--displacement-field regime as a stripe-ordered phase at zero field, yet only develops once the stripe is replaced by a bubble-like CDW at finite field. These findings demonstrate a decisive role of CDW order in stabilizing superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, establishing a new paradigm for the interplay between superconductivity and quantum Hall physics."

      "summary": "We build the case that our published chiral soliton model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 250402 (2019)] can lead to a genuine quantum time crystal for smaller atom numbers. To do this we compare results from the chiral soliton model with exact numerical solutions for the ground state of the three-particle Schr\\\"odinger equation in the limit that the spatial profile of the soliton is largely independent of its center-of-mass motion. The connection between the two approaches is found via the Page-Wootters mechanism, and this is what allows for dynamical evolution even in the quantum ground state, as required for a genuine quantum time crystal."

      "summary": "We have investigated the element specific magnetic characteristics of single-crystal FeCr2S4 using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We have found that the Fe L2,3-edge XAS spectra do not exhibit clear multiplet structures, indicating strong hybridization between the Fe 3d and S 3p orbitals, leading to delocalized rather than localized electronic states. The Fe 3d and Cr 3d spin moments are antiferromagnetically coupled, consistent with the Goodenough-Kanamori rule. The orbital magnetic moments of Fe and Cr are determined to be -0.23 and -0.017 {\\mu}B/ion, respectively. The large orbital magnetic moment of Fe is due to the d6 configuration under the relatively weak tetrahedra crystal field at the Fe site, and the delocalized Fe electrons maintain the orbital degree of freedom in spite of their itinerant nature. To understand phenomena such as the gigantic Kerr rotation, it is essential to consider not only the orbital degrees of freedom but also the role of spin-orbit coupling, which induces a finite orbital magnetic moment through t2 and e level hybridization under the tetrahedral crystal field. This finite orbital moment serves as a direct indicator of spin-orbit interaction strength and links element-specific orbital magnetism to the large Kerr rotation. On the other hand, the octahedral crystal-field splitting of the Cr 3d level is large enough to result in the quenching of the orbital moment of the Cr ion in FeCr2S4."

We overcome this limitation with a dynamic control strategy that accesses any configuration in a single global drive cycle by leveraging the system's sensitivity to the drive and its time derivatives. We realize this strategy with bistable beams on a rotating platform, where drive cycles become orbits in a control space of angular velocity and acceleration. State changes occur when these orbits cross switching thresholds, which we rationally design so that each state can be accessed by a single drive orbit. We construct a five-bit system and demonstrate its full addressability by selecting drive orbits that write all 26 uppercase letters of the alphabet in ASCII representation. This dynamic control paradigm offers a general route towards smart, remotely operated devices across various physical domains."

In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. It results in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries.

Traditional Variable Energy Doppler Broadening (VEDB) analysis tools, such as VEPFIT and ROYPROF, often present limitations due to outdated interfaces and lack of integration with comprehensive spectroscopy analysis platforms. Addressing these challenges, an open-source Python package for PAS analysis, PyPAS, is introduced. PyPAS offers functionalities including Coincidence Doppler Broadening (CDB) filtering, two-dimensional CDB analysis with DB and resolution extraction, and computation of lineshape parameters (S and W). Furthermore, it integrates modules for generating thermal positron implantation profiles based on established models, solving positron diffusion equations using finite-difference methods and optimizing diffusion length. This work presents the architecture of the PyPAS package and the validation results and demonstrates the application of the package through case studies."

We find that the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the N\\'eel vector. Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect provides both a method of manipulating altermagnetic magnetization in altemagnets and a probe of their intrinsic properties."

      "summary": "In 1975 Edwards and Anderson introduced a new paradigm that interacting quenched systems, such as a spin-glass, have a phase transition in which long time memory of spatial patterns is realized without spatial correlations. We show here that the information about the time-dependent correlations above the spin-glass transition are embedded in the four spin correlations of the intensity of speckle pattern. This encodes the spin-orientation memory and can be measured by the technique of resonant magnetic x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (RM- XPCS). We have implemented this method to observe and accurately characterize the critical slowing down of the spin orientation fluctuations in the classic metallic spin glass alloy $Cu_{1-x}{Mn}_x$ over time scales of ${2}$ sec. to $2 \\times 10^{\\mathbf{4}}$ secs. Remarkably the divergence of the correlation time as a function of temperature is consistent with the Vogel-Vulcher law, universally used to characterize the viscous relaxation time in structural glasses. Our method also opens the way for studying phase transitions in systems such as spin ices, quantum spin liquids, the structural glass transition, as well as possibly provide new perspectives on the multifarious problems in which spin-glass concepts have found applications."

Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\\Gamma$ effects. Our results show the phonon splitting of the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes have distinct origins: the $E_g$ splitting arises from MBC and is captured by our algorithm, while the $E_u$ splitting stems from correlation-sensitive Fano resonance, explaining their asymmetric experimental line shapes. We provide a design strategy and computational pathway for materials with large phonon magnetism and splitting, requiring SOC, electron-phonon coupling, and ideally flat bands at the Fermi level. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport."

For spin models, we demonstrate Gaussian asymptotics for the magnetization for a wide class of ferromagnetic spin systems on Euclidean lattices, in particular those with continuous spins. Specific applications include, in particular, the celebrated XY and Heisenberg models under ferromagnetic conditions, and more broadly, systems with very general rotationally invariant spins in arbitrary dimensions. We address both the setting of free boundary conditions and a large class of ferromagnetic boundary conditions, and our CLTs are endowed with near-optimal rate. Our approach leverages the classical Lee-Yang theory for the zeros of partition functions, and subsumes as a special case results of Lebowitz, Ruelle, Pittel and Speer on CLTs in discrete statistical mechanical models for which we obtain sharper convergence rates. In a different direction, we obtain CLTs for linear statistics of a wide class of point processes known as $\\alpha$-determinantal point processes which interpolate between negatively and positively associated random point fields. We contribute a unified approach to CLTs in such models; significantly, our approach is able to analyse such processes in dimensions $\\ge 3$, where structural alternatives such as connections to random matrix theory are not available. A key ingredient of our approach is a broad, quantitative extension of the classical Marcinkiewicz Theorem that holds under the limited condition that the characteristic function is non-vanishing only on a bounded disk. In spite of the general applicability of the results, our rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen bounds for independent sums up to a log factor."

Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon results from an interplay between two intrinsic limits of many-body systems: the limit of small evolution parameters and the limit of large system sizes. In the former case, conventional perturbation theory provides a straightforward explanation. In the latter case, a key insight is that pairs of vectors in the Hilbert space orthogonal to the initial state tend to become nearly orthogonal as the system size increases. We illustrate these general findings with two representative models of driven many-body systems: the driven Rice-Mele model and the driven interacting Kitaev chain model."

However, extending these concepts to non-equilibrium systems is an outstanding challenge. Despite recent progress in the study of dynamical phases, the universality classes and scaling laws for non-equilibrium phenomena are far less understood than those in equilibrium. In this work, using a trapped-ion quantum simulator with single-spin resolution, we investigate the non-equilibrium nature of critical fluctuations following a quantum quench to the critical point. We probe the scaling of spin fluctuations after a series of quenches to the critical Hamiltonian of a long-range Ising model. With systems of up to 50 spins, we show that the amplitude and timescale of the post-quench fluctuations scale with system size with distinct universal critical exponents, depending on the quench protocol. While a generic quench can lead to thermal critical behavior, we find that a second quench from one critical state to another (i.e.~a double quench) results in a new universal non-equilibrium behavior, identified by a set of critical exponents distinct from their equilibrium counterparts. Our results demonstrate the ability of quantum simulators to explore universal scaling beyond equilibrium."

In this paper, we present an algorithm for constructing all gapped boundaries and defects of two-dimensional Pauli stabilizer codes. Using the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data, such as anyon fusion rules and topological spins, of two-dimensional bulk stabilizer codes and one-dimensional boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $\\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits for both prime and nonprime $d$, enabling exploration of topological phases beyond the Kitaev toric code. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code.

This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering."

While thermal convection schemes using two-phase cooling in microfluidic networks or liquid immersion are proving effective, further progress requires tackling the intrinsic thermal resistance of a liquid/solid (L/S) interface, quantified by the thermal slip length. Theoretical models and experimental tools for estimating this length have been developed for superfluid/metal interfaces but no comparable tools exist for systems at non-cryogenic temperatures. Researchers have therefore come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to understand the influence of various parameters. But despite considerable effort, no actual relations have been proposed. Our study of 180 systems describing a liquid layer confined between identical crystals at different temperatures highlights the influence of correlated behavior throughout the L/S contact zone. When rescaled by key variables in the zone, the data for the thermal slip length exhibit excellent collapse onto two power law relations dependent on the peak value of the in-plane structure factor of the first liquid layer and the ratio of dominant frequencies pegged to the maxima in the vibrational density of states of the first liquid and solid layer. We hope that this perspective, which highlights the critical role of surface localized phonons in L/S systems, can now better guide development of analytic models and de novo interface designs for minimizing thermal slip."

In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth, namely higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic-state injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling, many-body quantum physics, and the benchmarking of quantum computational advantage."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, in previous studies, only the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems has been considered, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced by Shapourian et al. [Phys. Rev. B 95, 165101 (2017)], it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound."

Using the mean-field approximation, we demonstrate that the multiphoton JCHM exhibits quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI) phase, the superfluid phase, and an additional phase we refer to as the forbidden phase. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. When this conserved quantity diverges toward positive infinity, this system enters the forbidden phase. By analyzing the system, we observe MI, superfluid, and forbidden phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs, although the MI phases in the two-photon case are confined to subspaces with small values of the conserved quantity. In contrast, only the superfluid and forbidden phases appear in the three- and four-photon JCHMs, with no MI phase observed."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities -- termed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We investigate Perfect Absorption (PA) of radiation, in which incoming energy is entirely dissipated, in a system consisting of molecular spin centers coherently coupled to a planar microwave resonator operated at milliKelvin temperature and in the single photon regime. This platform allows us to fine tune the spin-photon coupling and to control the effective dissipation of the two subsystems towards the environment, thus giving us the opportunity to span over a wide space of parameters. Our system can be effectively described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibiting distinct Hermitian subspaces. We experimentally show that these subspaces, linked to the presence of PA, can be engineered through the resonator-spin detuning, which controls the composition of the polaritons in terms of photon and spin content. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered even in the absence of PT-symmetry. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how our results can be potentially exploited for applications, in particular as single-photon switches and modulators."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics."

Here, we classically simulate various physically-motivated circuits using 2D tensor network ans\\\"atze for the many-body wavefunction which match the geometry of the underlying quantum processor. We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit, with GPU hardware providing us with significant speedups over CPU hardware. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths. Our results underscore the role the geometry of the quantum processor plays in classical simulability."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\\text{Q}\\approx6.45~$k$\\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\\sim 1$~nH/$\\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks."

Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems."

Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer R\\'enyi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results complement recent analysis in the literature and show that the total magic of a state is unable to detect topological phases, indicating either that a different property is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource."

The authors find that standard approximations to the vdW interactions fail to describe both graphene and boron nitride accurately.
