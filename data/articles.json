      "summary": "Over twenty years ago Alexei Abrikosov [A.A. Abrikosov, Metal-insulator transition in layered cuprates (SDW model), Physica C: Supercond. Vol. 391, 2, 147-159 (2003)] considered the Spin-Density-Waves (SDW) model for the metal-insulator transition in layered cuprates. In one of those cuprates, YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$, there are one-dimensional (1D) CuO chains of copper and oxygen ions. In the present work we consider the metal-insulator transition in the model case of a 1D CuO chain in the regime of half-filling of the band. Our model is essentially the same, but as an exchange interaction causing the metal-insulator transition, we consider Kondo-Zener two-electron exchange, which successfully describes many of the electronic properties of the layered cuprates."

      "summary": "The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate valid scientific hypotheses for materials synthesis remains largely unquantified, hindered by the absence of benchmarks probing physicochemical logics reasoning. To address this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science. The MatterMech benchmark and associated code is publicly available at \\href{https://github.com/amair-lab/MatterMech}{GitHub}."

      "summary": "Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) generate broadband THz radiation via ultrafast spin-charge conversion in magnetic multilayers, offering spectral coverage beyond that of photoconductive antennas and nonlinear optical crystals. Here, we demonstrate a new type of STE based on PtxAu100-x alloy that achieves signifi- cantly higher THz output power than widely used Pt-based devices. Alloy composition and layer thickness tuning yield Pt75Au25 as the optimal alloy providing a 30 % increase in THz power in CoFeB/Pt75Au25 bilayer STEs compared to the optimized CoFeB/Pt reference STE. In W/CoFeB/Pt75Au25 trilayer STEs, we observe a 10 % higher THz power than in the optimized W/CoFeB/Pt trilayer. The STE efficiency is reduced upon annealing for both Pt75Au25- and Pt-based STEs due to formation of interfacial alloys. Our results establish Pt75Au25 as a promising platform for high-performance STEs, where its giant spin Hall effect significantly enhances efficiency over conventional Pt-based devices."

We show that Cayley-Schreier lattices can naturally give rise to implementable lattice systems that incorporate non-Abelian gauge structures transforming into a space-group symmetry. We show that the symmetry sectors can, moreover, be interpreted as blocks of spin models that can effectively realize a wealth of different topological invariants in a single setup. We underpin these general results with concrete models and show how they can be implemented in current experimental platforms. Our work sets the stage for a systematic investigation of topological insulators and metals with non-Abelian gauge structures."

      "summary": "We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality."

Applying a generalized response theory within a Keldysh path integral framework, we derive a non-perturbative current noise composition law, wherein the total noise is the sum of the noise of each fractionalized constituent (bosonic holons and fermionic spinons), weighted by their respective resistivities. We demonstrate that the formally derived composition relations can be interpreted in terms of a simple analogy with resistors in series. We leverage this composition rule near certain quantum critical points to show that the shot noise can be suppressed in long nanowires as compared to Fermi liquid expectations due to the collusion of quantum criticality with fractionalization."

This leads to an experimentally-observable effect: in an applied magnetic field, the charge transport along the field becomes purely ballistic, with the conductance given by $e^2/h$ per magnetic flux quantum through the sample cross-section. This is the strongest experimental manifestation of nontrivial topology in Weyl and Dirac semimetals."

The paradigm is extended here to a doubly stochastic protocol in which the resetting rate itself fluctuates in time and relaxes on its own timescale. An exact steady-state solution reveals three spatial regimes: a fluctuation-dominated core near the origin, a power-law regime at intermediate distances, and a far-field exponential decay fixed by the rate-relaxation time. These results expose how the instantaneous rate, mean rate, and relaxation time come together to determine the non-equilibrium steady state."

Topological materials offer certain features that allow them to circumvent these constraints, and potentially to form the basis for thermoelectric devices with unprecedented efficiency. In this article we review the thermoelectric performance of topological materials, focusing specifically on nodal semimetals, such as Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. We discuss how certain unique ``topological'' features of these materials -- namely their topologically protected band touching points, electron-hole degenerate lowest Landau level, and Berry curvature -- allow them to exhibit thermoelectric properties that go beyond what is possible in conventional materials, particularly in the presence of an applied magnetic field. We focus our discussion on the goal of achieving large figure of merit $zT$, and for each material class we summarize optimal \\emph{design principles} for selecting materials that maximize thermoelectric efficiency. We then use these optimal design principles to design and implement a high-throughput database search for topological semimetals that are promising as thermoelectrics. In addition to highlighting a number of materials that are already known to have large magnetothermoelectric effects, our search uncovers twelve additional materials that are especially promising for near-future experiments."

      "summary": "In network-based SIS models of infectious disease transmission, infection can only occur between directly connected individuals. This constraint naturally gives rise to spatial correlations between the states of neighboring nodes, as the infection status of connected individuals becomes interdependent. Although mean-field approximations are commonly invoked to simplify disease forecasting on networks, they fail to account for these correlations by assuming that infectious individuals are well-mixed within a population, leading to inaccurate predictions of infection numbers over time. As such, the development of mathematical frameworks that account for spatially correlated infections is of great interest, as they offer a compromise between accurate disease forecasting and analytic tractability. Here, we use existing corrections to mean-field theory on the regular lattice to construct a more general framework for equivalent corrections on regular random graph topologies. We derive and simulate a system of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the spatial correlation function at various geodesic distances on random networks, and use solutions to this hierarchy of ordinary differential equations to predict the global infection density as a function of time, finding good agreement with corresponding numerical simulations. Our results constitute a substantial development on existing corrections to mean-field theory for infectious individuals in SIS processes and provide an in-depth characterization of how structural randomness in networks affects the dynamical trajectories of infectious diseases on networks."

      "summary": "Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity."

      "summary": "The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible."

Despite recent progress in understanding MIPS in dry active systems, it has been debated whether MIPS can be observed in wet systems in which fluid-mediated hydrodynamic interactions (HI) are present. We use theory and large-scale {\\it Active Fast Stokesian Dynamics} simulations of the so-called squirmer model to show that collision-induced pusher force dipoles, which are present even for the simplest neutral squirmers (stealth swimmers), destroy MIPS when HI are included. Both rotational and translational HI independently suppress phase separation: rotation by shortening a swimmer's persistence length (and thus reducing the swim pressure), translation by a confinement-scale advective fluid flow. We further clarify that collisional dipoles between swimmers and boundaries can generate attractive flows that promote particle aggregation observed in some previous simulations and experiments. Finally, we show how to recover MIPS in fluidic environments by tuning the magnitude of the HI through brush-like surface coatings on the active particles."

      "summary": "The Edelstein effect consists of the non-equilibrium accumulation of magnetization in response to an applied electric field in systems with broken inversion symmetry. While the spin Edelstein effect (SEE), originating from spin moments, is well established, its orbital counterpart, where magnetization arises from orbital moment, has only recently begun to attract attention. In this work, we investigate the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) in gated monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, by using first-principles density-functional calculations with both electron and hole doping. The gate-induced broken mirror symmetry produces a Rashba-type chiral spin/orbital angular momentum texture, which in turn leads to the Edelstein effect in response to an applied in-plane electric field. We find that for electron doping the Edelstein response is dominated by the orbital channel, whereas for hole doping the orbital and spin contributions are comparable. For the case of hole doping, both OEE and SEE are strongly enhanced by a small amount of strain, due to strain-driven shifts between the Gamma and K/K' valley energies. We derive analytical expressions for the spin and orbital Edelstein susceptibilities and evaluate their magnitudes from first-principles. Remarkably, the predicted OEE in gated monolayer TMDs is an order of magnitude larger than values reported in previously studied systems. Our results identify TMDs as promising platforms for studying the orbital Edelstein effect and highlight their potential applications in spintronics devices."

      "summary": "The orbital degree of freedom has recently attracted significant attention due to the novel phenomena it enables in condensed matter systems. However, the interpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles remains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of orbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons and phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in bosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion of the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the latter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional antiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum geometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking, yielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM. We propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage generated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the bosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the emerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge between phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding magnon-polarons. They also advance a unified framework for harnessing orbital degrees of freedom in bosonic systems and pave the way toward electrical control of magnetization and phononic transport."

      "summary": "Rotational migration is one specific form of collective cell migration when epithelial cells are confined in a spherical geometry, such as in the epithelial acini. This tissue-level rotation motion is crucial for the morphogenesis of multiple epithelial systems. Here, we introduce a new primary human model for the study of rotational migration, pancreatic ductal organoids. Live imaging revealed the persistent rotation of the organoids over time. By tracking the nuclei, the three- dimensional trajectory of the cellular movement was reconstructed and the velocity of the rotation was quantified. The presence of focal adhesion clusters and prominent actin stress fibers were observed at the basal side of the organoids, suggesting the interactions between the cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Finally, our inhibition study showed the dependence of pancreatic ductal organoid rotational migration on myosin activity, actin polymerization, and actin branching. We hope that this model will enable future studies with human primary cells, which are more faithful to normal epithelial cells."

      "summary": "The electrical control of pure spin current remains a central challenge in spintronics, particularly in time-reversal symmetric systems composed of nonmagnetic elements, where spin and electric fields interact only indirectly. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for electrically tuning pure spin photocurrent in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry via a gate electric field. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that in systems with spin-orbit coupling and in-plane mirror symmetry, an out-of-plane electric field induces spin splitting and reversal in the band structure near the Fermi energy, enabling magnitude control and direction reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. To validate this mechanism, we perform first-principles calculations on germanene, an experimentally realized two-dimensional material. Beyond amplitude modulation, we reveal that reversing the direction of the applied electric field leads to a corresponding reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we show that the pure spin photocurrent can be tuned by varying the photon energy and the incident angle of light, providing additional degrees of control over spin transport. These findings establish a robust strategy for electric-field-controlled pure spin transport in two-dimensional materials, offering new possibilities for the development of optospintronic devices."

Cells were cycled at 1C to 3C rates, and post-mortem analysis were performed using Li nuclear reaction Analysis (Li-NRA), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Li-NRA using the resonant nuclear reaction between an incident high-energy proton and lithium was used to measure the depth distribution of Li in the cathode and anode layers. The Li-NRA analysis revealed a surface lithium peak on the anode, likely associated with SEI formation and lithium plating, while the cathode exhibited a decrease in lithium content by ~19.7%. XRD analysis of the cathode showed a contraction of the c-lattice parameter and peak shifts consistent with lithium depletion and structural deformation, supported by SEM imaging. In contrast, the dead graphite anode shows an enhanced peak at 43.3{\\deg}, which corresponds to the presence of metallic lithium or possibly Cu. 3-C rate cycling also led to capacity fade and an increase in internal resistance, highlighting the impact of lithium plating on cell performance."

Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be capable of detecting the first-order and $\\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ model, as well as the Ising and $\\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably, the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime of the XXZ model."

      "summary": "Nuclear power plants are prominent examples of heat-to-work conversion systems, and optimizing their thermodynamic performance offers significant potential for enhancing energy efficiency. With a development history of less than a century, optimization trends in nuclear power plants indicate that classical thermodynamics alone may be insufficient, particularly when maximizing output power rather than efficiency becomes the primary focus. This paper re-examines nuclear power plant thermodynamic cycles through the lens of finite-time thermodynamics, an approach specifically developed to address the practical requirement of enhancing power output. Beginning with the simpler Brayton cycle without phase transitions, we obtain the famous Curzon-Ahlborn formula for efficiency at maximum power. Subsequently we analyze the more complex Rankine cycle, which incorporates phase transitions. By explicitly considering the working fluid undergoing phase transitions within the cycle, we uncover the inherent trade-off between output power and efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate that both the maximum attainable power and efficiency increase as latent heat rises. These findings shall provide insights and methodologies for future thermodynamic optimization of nuclear power plants and other Rankine-type cycle systems."

Here, we introduce an inverse design workflow for Dion-Jacobson perovskites that is built on an invertible fingerprint representation for millions of conjugated diammonium organic spacers. By incorporating high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, interpretable machine learning, and synthesis feasibility screening, we identified new organic spacer candidates with deterministic energy level alignment between the organic and the inorganic motifs in the 2D hybrid perovskites.

      "summary": "The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable model with a quantum spin liquid ground state. While this model was originally proposed as an $S=1/2$ spin model on a honeycomb lattice, extensions to higher-spin systems have recently attracted attention. In contrast to the $S=1/2$ case, such higher-$S$ models are not exactly solvable and remain poorly understood, particularly for spin excitations at finite temperatures. Here, we focus on the $S=1$ Kitaev model, which is proposed to host bosonic quasiparticles. We investigate this model using Schwinger boson mean-field theory, introducing bosonic spinons as fractional quasiparticles by extending bond operators to address anisotropic spin interactions. We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a quantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models. Based on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure factors. We find that the conventional scheme based on Wick decoupling with respect to spinons yields unphysical momentum dependence: it produces strong spectral weight indicating ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) correlations in the antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Kitaev model. To resolve this issue, we propose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond operators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior disappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is consistent with the sign of the exchange constant. We also compute the temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor and find that the zero-temperature continuum splits into two distinct structures as temperature increases, which can be understood in terms of the bandwidth narrowing of spinons. Finally, we clarify why the two decoupling schemes result in different momentum dependences and discuss their relationship to previous studies."

This motivates the search for new oxide materials with enhanced conductivity. Crystal structure prediction is a powerful approach for identifying such candidates. However, the structural complexity of oxide SSEs, often involving unit cells with more than 100 atoms, presents significant challenges for conventional methods. In this study, we introduce TOPIC, a structure prediction algorithm that reduces configurational complexity by enforcing corner-sharing (CS) bond topology constraints. We demonstrate that TOPIC successfully reproduces the ground-state and metastable structures of known oxide SSEs, including LiTa$_2$PO$_8$ and Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$, which contain up to about 200 atoms per unit cell. By combining this approach with a pretrained machine-learning interatomic potential, we systematically screen quaternary oxide compositions and identify 92 promising candidates with CS frameworks. In particular, Li$_4$Hf$_2$Si$_3$O$_{12}$, which corresponds to the ground state at its composition, exhibits an ionic conductivity of 14 mS cm$^{-1}$, a hull energy of 21 meV atom$^{-1}$, and a band gap of 6.5 eV. Through our investigation, we identify the Li ratio as one of the key factors determining the stability of CS structures. Overall, our approach provides a practical and scalable pathway for discovering high-performance oxide solid electrolytes in previously unexplored chemical spaces."

In the present study, Ti40V60 alloy thin films have been deposited using DC magnetron co sputtering of Ti and V at ambient temperatures. The effect of deposition pressure on the film morphology, superconducting and normal state properties has been studied. Measurement of electrical resistance as a function of temperature indicates that up to a certain deposition pressure, the 20 nm thick Ti40V60 films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and superconductivity at low temperatures. Beyond a threshold pressure, the films show a negative temperature coefficient of resistance with a residual resistance ratio less than one. Electrical transport measurements in the presence of magnetic field were performed to find the current voltage characteristics of the thin films. Analysis of the I V curves indicates that the Ti40V60 alloy thin films have a large transport critical current density (JC) e.g. 1.475E10 A per m2 in zero magnetic field and 2.657E09 A per m2 in 4 T (both at 4 K). Analysis of the field dependence of flux line pinning force density indicates a combined effect of core delta k surface and core delta k point pinning mechanisms (where k is the Ginzburg Landau parameter). Additionally, spatial variations in the superconducting critical temperature (TC ) across the sample contribute to delta TC pinning. In higher magnetic fields, a contribution from delta l pinning (where l is the electron mean free path) also becomes significant. The findings indicate the potential of Ti40V60 alloy thin film for superconducting device applications like cryogenic radiation detectors."

A study on the optimization of the growth technology and superconducting transition temperature (TC) of MoSi thin films grown on SiO2 coated Si substrate is reported here. These films have been synthesized by co sputtering of Mo and Si targets with varying compositions and thicknesses to achieve optimized TC values close to that of the bulk. Mo80Si20 and Mo83Si17 compositions of the film, each with a thickness of 17 nm, exhibited the highest TC of 6.4 K and 5.9 K, respectively. Additionally, a meander structure with a 17 um wire width was patterned to estimate the transport critical current density (JC), which was measured to be 1.4E9 A per m2 at 4 K. Variation of the TC with film thickness and deposition pressure has been studied. Electrical resistance as a function of temperature of the film before and after meandering was also studied.

While existing universal interatomic potentials (UIPs) have been solely trained and validated on bulk datasets, we extend their applicability to complex and scientifically significant unary, binary, and ternary surface systems. We systematically compare models trained from scratch, zero-shot inference, conventional fine-tuning, and multi-head fine-tuning approach that enhances transferability and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Fine-tuning consistently reduces prediction errors with orders-of-magnitude fewer training configurations, and multi-head fine-tuning delivers robust and generalizable predictions even for materials beyond the initial training domain. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging pre-trained MLPs to accelerate surface modeling and highlight a scalable path toward data-efficient, next-generation atomic-scale simulations in computational materials science."

      "summary": "We theoretically investigate the superconducting gap structures in wallpaper fermions, which are surface states of topological nonsymmorphic crystalline insulators, based on a two-dimensional effective model. A symmetry analysis identifies six types of momentum-independent pair potentials. One hosts a point node, two host line nodes, and the remaining three are fully gapped. By classifying the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in the zero-dimensional symmetry class, we show that the point and line nodes are protected by $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants. In addition, for the twofold-rotation-odd pair potential, nodes appear on the glide-invariant line and are protected by crystalline symmetries, as clarified by the Mackey--Bradley theorem."

      "summary": "The kinetics of the photochromic reaction of oxygen-containing rare-earth hydrides is commonly described by an exponential function assuming a single-step process. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of the photochromic effect in oxygen-containing rare-earth metal hydrides, considering the kinetics of the reaction as a two-step process. We show that the fit to the experimental data is improved drastically when two processes that cause the photodarkening are assumed: a fast reaction rate-limited - for example, electronic or local - process and a slow, e.g. diffusion-limited process."

      "summary": "Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) supports a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) technologies, yet assessing its crystalline quality over large areas remains a fundamental challenge. Both antiparallel domains, an intrinsic outcome of epitaxy on high-symmetry substrates, and orientational domains have long evaded optical detection. Here, we show that interferometric second-harmonic generation (SHG) polarimetry provides a powerful, non-destructive probe of lattice orientation and structural integrity in chemical vapor deposition-grown hBN. This approach reveals the ubiquitous formation of antiparallel domains and quantifies their impact on crystalline order. SHG intensity also emerges as a direct optical metric of domain disorder, spanning three orders of magnitude across films produced by ten different growth routes. Correlation with Raman spectroscopy establishes a unified framework for evaluating crystalline quality. Beyond hBN, this method offers a high-throughput route to wide-area structural imaging in other non-centrosymmetric 2D materials, advancing their deployment in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies."

      "summary": "Our previous numerical simulation [C.-E. Tsai et al., Physical Review Research 6, 023065 (2024)] has shown that, for soft granular particles under quasistatic shearing, incorporating a speed-dependent friction is a necessary condition for reproducing the rate-dependent stick-slip fluctuations that have been found in laboratory experiments [J.-C. Tsai et al., Physical Review Letters 126, 128001 (2021)]. As a continuation, here we employ the simulation at a wide range of driving speeds to examine how grain inertia could also play a role in the quaking dynamics. We identify the critical volume fraction $\\phi_{\\text{c}}$ below which the system exhibits inertial flow as opposed to quasistatic flow. The quaking is found to occur only within the intermediate range of the characteristic speed ($V_{\\text{c}}$, beyond which the inter-particle friction declines) and at volume fractions above $\\phi_{\\text{c}}$. We conclude our findings by presenting state diagrams which show the progressive narrowing of the quaking regime as the driving speed increases and the disappearance of quaking at an extremely high shear rate."

However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates."

      "summary": "Topological polarization textures in ferroelectrics offer pathways to dense memory, neuromorphic computing, and controlled probes of topology in solids. In rhombohedral barium titanate, theory has identified stable antiskyrmions of topological charge -2 that fractionalize into six -1/3 fractional hotspots, termed topological quarks. Here we extend this landscape to Zr-substituted barium titanate (BZT) using a first-principles parameterized effective-Hamiltonian framework. In an ordered 12.5% composition, the chemically doubled periodicity enforces an alternation along [111]: one half hosts the -2 antiskyrmion (six -1/3 quarks), the other a +4 skyrmion (six +2/3 quarks). The two share the same six-vortex skeleton but differ by an integer +1 per vortex in the plane-integrated slice charge. In random BZT, nanodomains remain inducible and cryogenically stable, yet quenched disorder pins and distorts the vortices, producing a heterogeneous, skyrmion-glass like state with fluctuations of the topological charge along the axis. Thermal stability maps show that pure BT retains -2 textures up to ~100 K, whereas in BZT the critical temperature is nonmonotonic, with a minimum near 6-8% Zr, reflecting competition between ferroelectric softening and disorder pinning. Importantly, the 12.5% ordered arrangement remains rhombohedral above 300 K, enabling field-stabilized nanodomains at 293 K. Under a local [111] bias, the ordered system carries +4 slice charge, while the random composition fragments under the same conditions. These results establish BZT as a platform for chemically programmed, fractionalized ferroelectric topology from cryogenic to room temperature and suggest routes to multistate, reconfigurable devices."

This work addresses several lacks and limitations of previous approaches and allows for the accurate computa- tional study of thermal properties in a wide variety of many-body systems with MD. We have tested our modifications with Green-Kubo (GK) and Non-Equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations for vari- ous 2D and 3D material systems using the Tersoff and Stillinger-Weber potentials as examples. The spectral decomposition of the heat current was also calculated for monolayer graphene (1LG) and MoS2 , for different system lengths. Our results show that the heat current calculated by our method is consistently in agreement with the thermostat current in NEMD, while previous implementations can estimate quite poorly the thermal conductivity both under GK and NEMD simulations, and both for 2D and 3D materials. The decomposition of the heat current also sheds light on the con- tribution of different phonon modes to thermal conductivity and its dependence on length. Our methodology is implemented in the widely used LAMMPS code specifically for the Tersoff and SW potentials, and it is readily applicable to the vast majority of many-body MD potentials."

Here, we employ femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) to experimentally study magnetization fluctuations in the canted antiferromagnet Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$ across its spin reorientation transition and under external magnetic fields. By comparing our measurements to atomistic spin noise and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the amplitude of the spin noise is governed by the free energy, with stronger fluctuations in regions where the potential landscape softens. We furthermore demonstrate that external magnetic fields suppress spin fluctuations and enhance the quasi-ferromagnetic magnon frequency by effectively stiffening the potential. These results highlight an effective route for tuning ultrafast magnetization fluctuations via external parameters."

      "summary": "Defects in high temperature superconductors such as YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) critically influence their superconducting behavior, as they substantially degrade or even suppress superconductivity. With the renewed interest in cuprates for next-generation superconducting magnets operating in radiation-harsh environments such as fusion reactors and particle accelerators, accurate atomistic modeling of defects and their dynamics has become essential. Here, we present a general-purpose machine-learning interatomic potential for YBCO, based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) method and trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data, with particular emphasis on defects and their diffusion mechanisms. The potential is validated against DFT calculations of ground-state properties, defect formation energies of oxygen Frenkel pairs and diffusion barriers for their formation. Remarkably, the potential captures the diffusion-driven orthorhombic to tetragonal transition at elevated temperatures, a transformation that is difficult to describe with empirical potentials, elucidating how the formation of oxygen Frenkel pairs in the basal plane governs this order-disorder transition. The ACE potential introduced here enables large-scale, predictive atomistic simulations of defect dynamics and transport processes in YBCO, providing a powerful tool to explore its stability, performance, and functionality under realistic operating conditions. Moreover, this work proves that machine learning interatomic potentials are suitable for studies of quaternary oxides with complex chemistry."

The material was structurally and chemically characterized by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, powder x-ray diffraction, Laue method and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The structural analysis confirmed the orthorhombic crystal structure (space group $Imma$) but revealed differences in the lattice parameters and bond distances in comparison to previous work by Sharma et al.. The composition is close to the ideal 1:3:2 stoichiometry with an occupation of 7 % of the Si sites by Pd. The heat capacity, electrical resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility show two magnetic transitions indicating antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\\rm N1}= 61\\,\\rm K$ and a spin reorientation at $T_{\\rm N2}= 40\\,\\rm K$. The orthorhombic material shows magnetic anisotropy with field applied along the three main symmetry axes, which is summarized in the temperature-field phase diagrams. The susceptibility data hint to an alignment of the magnetic moments along $[100]$ between $T_{\\rm N1}$ and $T_{\\rm N2}$. Below $T_{\\rm N2}$ the magnetic structure changes to an arrangement with moments canted away from $[100]$. In contrast to published work by Sharma et al., the single crystals investigated in this study show AFM order below $T_{\\rm N1}$ instead of ferromagnetism that sets in at higher $T_{\\rm C1}=78\\,\\rm K$ which might originate from certain differences in the structure, composition or defects that have an impact on the dominant coupling constants of the RKKY interaction."

      "summary": "The diffusion of tracer particles immersed in a granular gas under uniform shear flow (USF) is analyzed within the framework of the inelastic Boltzmann equation. Two different but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results. First, we maintain the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator but consider inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). Using IMM allows us to compute the collisional moments of the Boltzmann operator without knowing the velocity distribution functions of the granular binary mixture explicitly. Second, we consider a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres (IHS). This kinetic model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of IHS. We solve the Boltzmann--Lorentz kinetic equation for tracer particles using a generalized Chapman--Enskog--like expansion around the shear flow distribution. This reference distribution retains all hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. The mass flux is obtained to first order in the deviations of the concentration, pressure, and temperature from their values in the reference state. Due to the velocity space anisotropy induced by the shear flow, the mass flux is expressed in terms of tensorial quantities rather than the conventional scalar diffusion coefficients. The exact results derived here are compared with those previously obtained for IHS by using different approximations [JSTAT P02012 (2007)]. The comparison generally shows reasonable quantitative agreement, especially for IMM results. Finally, we study segregation by thermal diffusion as an application of the theory. The phase diagrams illustrating segregation are shown and compared with IHS results, demonstrating qualitative agreement."

The first method determines the region of convergence of the joint Laplace transform and the $z$-transform of the first-passage time distribution by solving an equation of poles with respect to the $z$-transform parameter. The scaled cumulant generating function is then obtained as the logarithm of the boundary values within this region. The theoretical basis lies in the facts that the dynamics of the open quantum systems can be unraveled into a piecewise deterministic process and there exists a tilted Liouville master equation in Hilbert space. The second method uses a simulation-based approach built on the wave function cloning algorithm. To validate both methods, we derive analytical expressions for the scaled cumulant generating functions in field-driven two-level and three-level systems. In addition, we present numerical results alongside cloning simulations for a field-driven system comprising two interacting two-level atoms."

For fields between 15.8 T and 18.5 T, the anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility, the slow saturation of the NMR line spectral ratio with temperature, and the power-law temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ suggest the ground state to be a spin supersolid with gapless spin excitations.

We test this idea in the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (cSYK) model with a conserved U(1) charge. Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity, identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism. These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems."

In this work, we propose a new approach to study Anderson localization based on the density matrix formalism. Drawing an analogy to the standard transfer matrix method, we extract the localization length from the modular density matrix in quasi-one-dimensional systems. This approach successfully captures the metal-insulator transition in the three-dimensional Anderson model and in the two-dimensional Anderson model with spin-orbit coupling. It can be also readily extended to multiorbital systems. We further generalize the formalism to interacting systems, showing that the one-dimensional spinless attractive model exhibits the expected metallic phase, consistent with previous studies.

      "summary": "Ultra-small Josephson junctions are strongly influenced by noise and damping due to energy dissipation into the environment, which are expected to suppress phase coherence. Here, we investigate the coherence properties of atomic-scale Josephson junctions in a scanning tunneling microscope under microwave excitation. Plain Pb-Pb junctions exhibit hysteretic Shapiro steps as signature of a coherent resonant state. With increasing AC amplitude, phase coherence is reduced due to an increase of thermal fluctuations. In the presence of magnetic adatoms the Josephson coupling energy is reduced and quasi-particle tunneling is enhanced. With AC driving we observe a rapid suppression of coherence that we ascribe to photon-assisted quasi-particle tunneling through Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. Our results highlight the presence of phase coherence and shed light on the origin of the transition to incoherent transport, thereby revealing the importance of controlling dissipation in nanoscale superconducting devices."

      "summary": "The pursuit of topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems has unveiled new physics beyond the conventional Hermitian paradigm, yet their realization in interacting many-body platforms remains a critical challenge. Exploring this interplay is essential to understand how strong interactions and dissipation collectively shape topological phases in open quantum systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate non-Hermitian spectra topology in a dissipative Rydberg atomic gas and characterize parameters-dependent winding numbers. By increasing the interaction strength, the system evolves from Hermitian to non-Hermitian regime, accompanying emergence of trajectory loop in the complex energy plane. As the scanning time is varied, the spectra topology becomes twisted in the complex energy plane manifesting as a topology phase transition with the sign winding number changed. When preparing the system in different initial states, we can access a nontrivial fractional phase within a parameter space that globally possesses an integer winding. Furthermore, by changing the scanning direction, we observe the differentiated loops, revealing the breaking of chirality symmetry. This work establishes cold Rydberg gases as a versatile platform for exploring the rich interplay between non-Hermitian topology, strong interactions, and dissipative quantum dynamics."

We construct a hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying the differences in trainability and representational power.

      "summary": "Altermagnets possess two key features: non-relativistic alternating spin splitting (i.e., altermagnetism) and a material-dependent N\\'{e}el vector. The former naturally coexists with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in real materials on substrates, prompting the question of how SOC affects the magnetic properties of altermagnets. The latter is crucial for information storage, making it essential to determine its orientation. To address these issues, we study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional (2D) $d$-wave altermagnets by independently varying the N\\'{e}el vector orientation and the SOC strength. Our results demonstrate that the N\\'{e}el vector orientation can be accurately determined via the Ising term without SOC, or qualitatively inferred via the DM terms with SOC. Moreover, we observe a novel Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) component distinct from previous reports, whose emergence is attributed to the synergy between altermagnetism and SOC. Additionally, through tuning SOC strength, we reveal the evolution of the RKKY spin models governed by five distinct mechanisms: the spin model may be determined solely by altermagnetism, solely by SOC, or solely by the kinetic term; alternatively, altermagnetism may coincidentally yield the same moderately anisotropic spin model as SOC, or compete with SOC to produce a spin model with maximal anisotropy. Beyond SOC strength, which mechanism operates also relies on the N\\'{e}el vector orientation and impurity configurations. All results are numerically verified. These findings -- which were inaccessible in prior studies due to the limitations of first-order SOC expansion and fixed N\\'{e}el vector orientation -- provide important new insights into the magnetic properties of altermagnets."

      "summary": "Metal inorganic-organic complex (MIOC) glasses have emerged as a new family of melt-quenched glasses. However, the vitrification of MIOC is challenging since most of the crystalline MIOC precursors decompose before melting. The decomposition problem severely narrows the compositional range of MIOC glass formation. Here, we report a novel approach for preparing the MIOC glasses that combines slow-solvent-removal with subsequent quenching to avoid gel thermal decomposition and crystallization. Specifically, the new approach utilizes an aprotic solvent (acetone) to kinetically prevent the ordering of the metal-ligand complex molecules in solution, thereby suppressing crystallization and forming a gel. The subsequent gradual drying process leads to the removal of the solvent to enhance the connections between molecules through hydrogen bonds, thus causing the formation of a hydrogen-bonded network. The increased network connectivity lowers the mobility of the molecules, thereby avoiding gel crystallization. Consequently, a disordered network is frozen-in during quenching of the dried gel from 130 {\\deg}C to room temperature, and finally MIOC glass forms. Structural analyses reveal that hydrogen bonds are responsible for connecting the tetrahedral units. The as-prepared MIOC glass exhibits some fascinating behaviors, e.g., Tg increasing with rapid room-temperature relaxation, CO2 uptake, and red-shift of photoluminescence. This work not only presents a novel strategy for fabricating large-sized, stable, functional MIOC glasses, but also uncovers the critical role of hydrogen bonds in MIOC glass formation."

In addition, the probability distribution of the particle's position can be evaluated systematically as a series expansion in the propulsion speed. Compared to previous methods relying on eigenfunction expansions of the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation, our method is easier to generalize to more complex situations: it does not rely on eigenfunctions but on a reference state that can be solved analytically, which in our case is the passive Brownian particle in a harmonic potential. We exemplify this versatility by also briefly treating an ABP with an active torque (Brownian circle swimmer, BCS) in a harmonic potential."

ZnSe NWs were grown via the vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism, while TMD (MoSe2 or WSe2) shells were formed through a two-step process of sacrificial oxide layer deposition via magnetron sputtering followed by selenization process in a chemical vapor transport reactor. As-grown nanostructures were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It was observed that the TMD shell morphology can be controlled through the selenization process temperature optimization, which arises due to different growth mechanisms discussed here.

In this work, we investigate the effects of on-site Hubbard interactions on the topological, magnetic, and quantum geometric properties of the Creutz ladder, a paradigmatic model of a one-dimensional topological insulator. Using a self-consistent mean-field approach, we uncover a first-order, interaction-driven phase transition that is simultaneously magnetic and topological. We demonstrate that as the Hubbard interaction $U$ is increased, the system's ground state abruptly switches from an anti-ferromagnetic (AF) configuration to a ferromagnetic (F) one. This magnetic transition coincides with a topological transition, marked by a quantized jump in the Zak phase from $\\pm\\pi$ to $0$. We systematically compute the phase diagrams in the parameter space of on-site energy staggering ($\\epsilon$) and inter-chain hopping asymmetry ($\\lambda$), revealing the critical interaction strength $U_c$. Furthermore, we analyze the quantum geometry of the Bloch states by calculating the Fubini-Study metric, demonstrating that its components exhibit divergences that precisely signal the topological phase transition. By analyzing the full energy spectrum, we distinguish the true ground state from metastable excited states that emerge past the critical point. Our results establish the Creutz-Hubbard ladder as a minimal model for studying interaction-induced topological phenomena and suggest a potential route for controlling magnetic, topological, and geometric properties via electronic correlations."

This allows for innovation both inspired by experimental observations, and by construction of novel systems with desired properties. In this paper, we develop a novel system in the search for a new kind of pattern formation: microstructural motifs with orthogonal alignment. Taking a simple active Brownian particle (ABP) model applied to dumbbell-shaped particles, we add a quadrupolar interaction by positioning two antiparallel magnetic dipolar moments on each particle. We find that the phase behavior is determined by the competition between active motion and the orthogonal alignment favored by quadrupolar attraction. By varying these quantities, we are able to tune both the internal structure of the aggregates, and find a surprising stability of triangular aggregates, to the point of clusters of size $N=3$ being strongly overrepresented. Although none of the component particles are chiral, the resulting structures spin in a random, fixed direction due to combination of the polarity of the active motion. This results in an ensemble of windmilling (randomly spinning in a circular motion) aggregates with windmill-like shape (due to the three- or four core component dumbbells). Ultimately, this simple model shows an interesting range of microstructural motifs, with great potential for experimental implementations."

Here, we demonstrate energy harvesting from a nonthermal Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid in quantum Hall edge channels, where the non-thermal state is naturally formed due to the absence of thermalization. The scheme is tested with a quantum-dot energy harvester working on a non-thermal TL liquid supplied with waste heat from a quantum-point-contact transistor. Compared to the quasi-thermalized TL liquid, the non-thermal state prepared under the same heat is capable of a larger electromotive force and higher conversion efficiency. These characteristics can be understood by considering a binary Fermi distribution function of the non-thermal state induced by entropy-conserving equilibration. TL liquids are attractive non-thermal carriers for excellent energy harvesting."

We establish that strain gradient unlocks a thermal conductivity (k) suppression mechanism fundamentally more potent than uniform strain: moderate uniaxial gradients (0.6%/nm) suppress k by 32-37% (27-30%) in thin films (nanowires), intensifying to 43.3% with biaxial gradients. This reduction far exceeds that from equivalent uniform strain and surpasses benchmark materials like silicon and BAs. Critically, a surprising decoupling emerges: while 3% uniform strain alters thermal anisotropy by ~25%, strain gradient strongly suppresses k with preserving this ratio. Mechanistically, strain gradients-induced symmetry breaking and enhanced mode coupling anisotropically activate forbidden scattering channels, making gradient-driven scattering dominant over intrinsic phonon scattering below 6.25 THz. These findings redefine non-uniform strain from a parasitic flaw into a powerful design tool for engineering thermal isolation and heat flux in next-generation flexible and high-power \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 electronics."

In this model, the gap matrix acquires a rich structure where short-range superconducting correlations coexist with long-range correlations that are exponentially localized at both chain edges simultaneously. As a direct consequence, the topological edge modes hybridize even if their wavefunction overlap vanishes, and the edge mode mass inherits the asymptotic scaling of the interaction. In contrast to models with imposed power law pairing, where massive Dirac modes emerge for exponents $\\nu 0$, despite exponential wave function localization. While the edge mode remains massless in the thermodynamic limit, finite-size corrections can be experimentally relevant in mesoscopic systems with effective long-range interactions that decay sufficiently slowly."

To this end, we develop a systematic closure scheme for the moment expansion of their Fokker-Planck equation. Starting from the coupled evolution of translational and orientational degrees of freedom, we derive equations for the density, polarization, and nematic tensor fields, which naturally generate an infinite hierarchy of higher-order moments. To obtain explicit solutions, we investigate truncation strategies and analyze closures at different orders. While the closure at lowest order yields Gaussian dynamics with an effective translational diffusion, closures at higher orders incorporate orientational correlations and reproduce non-Gaussian features in the ISF. By confronting these approximations with exact solutions based on spheroidal wave functions and with Brownian dynamics simulations, we identify their range of validity in terms of P\\'eclet number, wavenumber, and observation timescales. An advantage of this method is its ability to yield approximate yet explicit expressions not only for the ISF but also for polarization and nematic fields, which are often neglected but relevant in scattering experiments and theoretical modeling. Beyond providing a practical guide to select the appropriate closure according to the spatiotemporal regime, our framework highlights the efficiency of moment-based approaches compared to exact yet implicit formulations. This strategy can be systematically extended to more complex situations, such as propulsion switching, confinement, or external fields, where functional bases for exact solutions are generally unavailable."

      "summary": "The cuprates exhibit anomalous momentum-space structure with antinodal gap and nodal arc in the underdoped regime, which evolves into a complete hole-type Fermi surface with a large Luttinger volume in the overdoped regime. The real-space electronic structure is also quite complex, as characterized by microscopic inhomogeneities and intertwined density wave orders. Here we show that doped holes in cuprate form localized electronic molecules consisting of 4a0 plaquettes, and each plaquette contains approximately two holes. The effective local doping level is thus around 1/8, which is sufficient to destroy the underlying AF order and more importantly, recovers the half-filled metallic state of the original CuO2 plane. The restored Fermi surface, hosting one hole per unit cell, is consistent with experimental results and satisfies the Luttinger theorem. We then construct the momentum-space structure of the half-filled metal by considering the real-space configuration of electronic molecules. We show that the electronic potential with 4a0 periodicity imposed by the plaquettes and the quantum size effect of electronic molecules obliterate the nested antinodal Fermi surface sheets, leaving behind short arcs with coherent quasiparticles around the node. We propose that two doped holes in each plaquette occupy the shared molecular orbital and form a spin singlet, which can mediate the pairing of itinerant holes on the remnant Fermi surface of the half-filled metal. The electric dipole moment between the molecular orbitals and the dopant ions may also provide a novel attractive interaction between itinerant holes. This phenomenological model for pair formation between itinerant holes on the half-filled Fermi surface mediated by localized molecular orbitals resolves several core issues concerning the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates."

      "summary": "Quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases exist in theory, but real candidate QSL materials are often extraordinarily sensitive to structural defects which disrupt the ground state. Here, we investigate candidate triangular QSL material YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ and discover the absence of magnetic order, but also no compelling evidence of a QSL ground state due to significant structural disorder. We instead look at the results through a lens of a 2-dimensional (2D) random singlet phase. YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ behaves strikingly similar to other disordered triangular lattice materials, suggesting universal behavior of random singlet formation in 2D frustrated systems."

      "summary": "Terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulses offer a promising route for the ultrafast manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic materials. While previous studies have demonstrated the excitation of spin dynamics using linearly polarized THz fields, the role of circular polarization and the effects of rapidly oscillating, time-dependent field profiles remained insufficiently understood. We have developed a unified theoretical framework for describing the excitation of spin precession via Zeeman interaction in magnetic materials by high frequency pulses of arbitrary polarization with temporal Gaussian profile. In the regime of long pulses (at least several oscillations are within the pulse duration), a circularly polarized magnetic field acts as an effective rectified magnetic field along the pulse propagation, while linear polarized pulses excite no free precession. In the regime of short pulses (less than one oscillation is within the pulse duration), pulses of any polarization, including linear one can excite free spin precession. There is an optimal pulse duration which maximizes amplitude of the spin precession. It depends on magnetic parameters of the sample and the external magnetic field, as well as on the carrier frequency of the pulse and its amplitude. These findings bridge key gaps in the understanding of THz-induced spin dynamics and provide insights into the design of light-controlled magnetization schemes using tailored electromagnetic pulses."

      "summary": "Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i) Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing; and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet achieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point Operations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond segmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as lead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators of crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality. These capabilities establish PerovSegNet as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.The source code is available at:https://github.com/wlyyj/PerovSegNet/tree/master."

Their small size and energy efficiency of generating spiking electrical signals enable usage in fully implantable cochlear implants. Here, we propose an auditory sensing unit realized by a piezo-MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) cantilever connected to a VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator circuit. This auditory sensing unit is capable of frequency-selective detection of vibrations and subsequent emission of a neural spiking waveform. The auditory sensing unit is tested under biologically realistic vibration amplitudes, and spike rate-encoding of the incoming stimulus is demonstrated, similarly to natural hearing processes. The tunability of the output spiking frequency and the shape of the spiking waveform are also demonstrated to provide suitable voltage spikes for the nervous system."

      "summary": "The dielectric response of mono-alcohols exhibits a strong Debye peak generally attributed to the dynamics of hydrogen-bonds (HB) supramolecular structures through a mechanism that remains unclear in many aspects. In this letter, we use standard all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate this phenomenon in 1-propanol, a prototypic monoalcohol, over a wide temperature range covering a significant change in dielectric permittivity. We obtained dielectric spectra showing a Debye peak in good agreement with experimental data, which we decomposed into the self and cross parts of the dipolar correlations. The latter extends over a few molecular distances and contributes increasingly to the Debye peak upon cooling. To investigate its physical origin, we analyzed the HB structures by identifying clusters from simulation snapshots. Below 300~K, the dielectric permittivity was shown to arise almost entirely from intra-cluster cross-correlations. Furthermore, by tracking the dipole decorrelation of groups of molecules initially belonging to the same cluster, we found that supramolecular structures play a key role in stabilizing cross-correlation over time scales longer than the relaxation of individual molecules."

Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals."

While deep learning methods offer state-of-the-art performance, their computational complexity and data requirements can be prohibitive. In this study we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two classical, computationally efficient transform-domain techniques: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Fourier Cosine Transform (DFCT) filtering. We evaluated their efficacy in denoising medical images which corrupted by Gaussian, Uniform, Poisson, and Salt-and-Pepper noise. Contrary to the common hypothesis favoring wavelets for their multi-resolution capabilities, our results demonstrate that a block-based DFCT approach consistently and significantly outperforms a global DWT approach across all noise types and performance metrics (SNR, PSNR, IM). We attribute DFCT's superior performance to its localized processing strategy, which better preserves fine details by operating on small image blocks, effectively adapting to local statistics without introducing global artifacts. This finding underscores the importance of algorithmic selection based on processing methodology, not just transform properties, and positions DFCT as a highly effective and efficient denoising tool for practical medical imaging applications."

We find that in the limit of weak inter-chain coupling, such a coupled system exhibits transitions from delocalized to intermediate phase with increase in the non-Hermiticity parameter. However, for stronger inter-chain coupling strengths, the delocalized phase undergoes a transition to localized phase and then to an intermediate phase. Interestingly, the intermediate phase in this case exhibits the non-Hermitian comb effect (NHCE), i.e., the coexistence of localized and extended states rather than being well separated from each other by any mobility edge which is conventional in any intermediate phase. We further show that such a NHCE originates from the isolated site limit of the quasiperiodic chain and provide an analytical explanation supporting the numerical signatures."

It hosts pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state, and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological performance."

This study explores the effect of concentration ratios of natural dyes extracted from mangosteen peel (MP) and grass jelly leaves (GJL) on the optical, morphological, and photovoltaic properties of DSSCs. Dye solutions were prepared at a fixed concentration of 0.6 g/mL, with the MP:GJL volume ratio varied at 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. As a result, UV-Vis absorption spectra showed that the MP contributes to the UV-blue region (350-450), while the GJL contributes to the red region (650-700 nm). The current-voltage (J-V) analysis showed that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MP and GJL dyes is 2.75% and 2.12%. The composite dye with a 1:3 (MP:GJL) ratio yielded the highest PCE of 3.50%, demonstrating the synergistic effect of combining these natural sensitizers to broaden the light absorption spectrum."

Focusing on two-dimensional (2D) systems with Ising spin-orbit coupling, relevant to transition-metal dichalcogenides, we identify two regimes: an intervalley $s$-wave paired state where a weak magnetic field activates the effect, and an intravalley chiral $p$-wave paired state that exhibits a spontaneous charge or spin Nernst response without a field. We propose an experimental setup that circumvents screening and provide estimates of the signal magnitude. Our results establish the Nernst effect as a direct probe of Berry curvature and pairing symmetry in 2D spin-orbit-coupled superconductors."

      "summary": "The operator wavefunction provides a fine-grained description of quantum chaos and of the irreversible growth of simple operators into increasingly complex ones. Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a phase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called $\\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a holographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator remains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body system. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related concept of $\\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a phase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding is a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding under two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and size bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and (ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\\lambda_L \\leq 2 \\alpha$ (with $\\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\\alpha$ the growth rate), which ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not saturate this bound, with $h = \\lambda_L / 2\\alpha <1$, the winding with Pauli size $\\ell$ becomes $\\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\\ell^{1/h}$. We illustrate these results with two microscopic models: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and a disordered $k$-local spin model."

      "summary": "Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metal nanoparticles have been studied extensively through scattering and absorption. Static magnetic field-induced changes in plasmonic far-field response stem from the classical Hall effect and are generally very small in noble metals within the visible frequency range at readily accessible magnetic fields. Planar plasmonic tunnel junctions allow the study of nanogap LSPRs through current-driven light emission. We find that the electroluminescence of such junctions is modulated by tens of percent with a magnetic field of a few Teslas, exceeding Hall-based expectations by orders of magnitude. Complementary quantum mechanical and electromagnetic modeling reveals that a modest static magnetic field can introduce significant chirality in the transition dipoles generated during the electron tunneling process. This strongly affects the excitation of LSPRs and leads to magnetic-field sensitive far-field electroluminescent emission. This is a new paradigm for tunable nanoscale light sources."

Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy (\"Hypothesis H\")."

As our main application, we compare the Trotter time-evolution of three- and four-qubit wave functions to a compressed quantum circuit version of the same evolution operator.

The resulting arctic curves are only piecewise analytic, as in the known non-free fermion cases of Six vertex model with domain-wall boundaries and its relatives.

Generative tools provide the ability to expand and refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces. We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604 high-performing candidates."

Among these, bosonic systems are particularly significant due to their theoretical importance and experimental relevance. In this Letter, we propose a classical algorithm with a quasipolynomial runtime to efficiently approximate the partition function of long-range bosonic systems at high temperatures. For finite-range systems, the complexity improves to almost polynomial time. We also present a rigorous proof for the power-law decay of correlation functions. This property, known as clustering of correlation, is well-established for finite-range spin models. However, in sharp contrast, has remained largely unexplored for long-range bosonic systems. The results presented here address two long-standing gaps concerning the computational complexity and correlation clustering in such systems. The methodology we introduce provides new tools for future studies of challenging problems in statistical and quantum many-body physics concerning bosonic system and computational complexity."

Nonlinear processes such as triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) offer photon upconversion (UC) at yields desired for solid-state optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a multilayer molecular system where a near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer facilitates robust photon UC. A molecular stack of squaraine DIB-SQ: 6,6-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is optimized for UC by fine tuning the PCBM loading to engineer charge transfer states that facilitate further triplet generation. This composite NIR photosensitizer layer, at a 1:3 blend ratio in heterojunction with rubrene, drives triplet population density to levels desired for effective TTA. When paired with a fully optimized annihilator layer of tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) doped rubrene, the NIR sensitizer produces a photon upconversion quantum yield of 1.36% at 690 nm, with a significantly low excitation intensity threshold for the onset of the linear regime.. Time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption spectroscopy, and magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a detailed balance of photoexcited states and formation of charge transfer states of triplet character (3CT), which work in tandem with molecular states to sensitize the triplet state (T1) of rubrene. This approach of harnessing near-infrared photons presents promising avenue for advancing solid-state photon interconversion."

Crucially, this framework remains valid even when the density matrix of the system is an average over stochastic Gaussian trajectories, yielding a non-Gaussian state. We present efficient numerical protocols based on this structure and demonstrate their feasibility through a small-scale simulation. Our approach opens a scalable path to quantifying non-Markovianity in interacting or measured fermionic systems, with applications in quantum information and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics."

Moreover, even at the nominal decoupled point, residual wavefunction delocalization persists, causing unintended qubit-qubit coupling. Here we propose a multi-mode tunable coupler that enables nonlinear control of interactions across excitation manifolds, achieving a high on-off ratio in the one-excitation manifold while suppressing coupling in the two-excitation manifold. The proposed design also realizes complete localization between qubits, providing perfect isolation at the decoupled point and opening new possibilities for scalable, high-fidelity quantum gates."

Local transition-state networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1 saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized N\\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\\'eel-type skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2).

This problem forms a serious challenge in micromagnetics with periodic boundary conditions and related fields. Nowadays, it is common practice to truncate the associated infinite lattice sum to a finite number of images, introducing uncontrolled errors. We show that, for general interacting geometries, the exact infinite sum for both dipolar interactions and generalized Riesz power-law potentials can be obtained by complementing a small direct sum by a correction term that involves efficiently computable derivatives of generalized zeta functions. We show that the resulting representation converges exponentially in the derivative order, reaching machine precision at a computational cost no greater than that of truncated summation schemes. In order to compute the generalized zeta functions efficiently, we provide a superexponentially convergent algorithm for their evaluation, as well as for all required special functions, such as incomplete Bessel functions. Magnetic fields can thus be evaluated to machine precision in arbitrary cuboidal domains periodically extended along one or two dimensions. We benchmark our method against known formulas for magnetic interactions and against direct summation for Riesz potentials with large exponents, consistently achieving full precision. In addition, we identify new corrections to the asymptotic limit of the demagnetization field and tabulate high-precision benchmark values that can be used as a reliable reference for micromagnetic solvers. The techniques developed are broadly applicable, with direct impact in other areas such as molecular dynamics."

Many experiments of interest in quantum gravity and many-body physics, including the butterfly effect in quantum information scrambling and the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, involve queries to a random unitary $U$ alongside its inverse $U^\\dagger$, conjugate $U^*$, and transpose $U^T$. However, conventional notions of approximate unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) fail to capture these experiments. In this work, we introduce and construct strong unitary designs and strong PRUs that remain robust under all such queries. Our constructions achieve the optimal circuit depth of $O(\\log n)$ for systems of $n$ qubits. We further show that strong unitary designs can form in circuit depth $O(\\log^2 n)$ in circuits composed of independent two-qubit Haar-random gates, and that strong PRUs can form in circuit depth $\\text{poly}(\\log n)$ in circuits with no ancilla qubits. Our results provide an operational proof of the fast scrambling conjecture from black hole physics: every observable feature of the fastest scrambling quantum systems reproduces Haar-random behavior at logarithmic times."

      "summary": "The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, is vital for the realization of, e.g., quantum networks, distributed quantum computing, and quantum repeaters. The microwave-to-optical quantum transduction is of particular interest in the field of superconducting quantum computing, since interconnecting dilution refrigerators is considered inevitable for realizing large-scale quantum computers with fault-tolerance. In this review, we overview recent theoretical and experimental studies on the quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons. We describe a generic theory for the quantum transduction employing the input-output formalism, from which the essential quantities characterizing the transduction, i.e., the expressions for the transduction efficiency, the added noise, and the transduction bandwidth are derived. We review the major transduction methods that have been experimentally demonstrated, focusing the transduction via the optomechanical effect, the electro-optic effect, the magneto-optic effect, and the atomic ensembles. We also briefly review the recent experimental progress on the quantum transduction from superconducting qubit to optical photon, which is an important step toward the quantum state transfer between distant superconducting qubits interconnected over optical fibers."

We investigate niobium nitride (NbN) coplanar waveguide resonators integrated with Si/SiGe quantum wells, creating a hybrid platform designed for CMOS-compatible quantum hardware. Using temperature-dependent microwave spectroscopy in the single-photon regime, we examine resonance frequency and quality factor variations to probe the underlying loss mechanisms. Our analysis identifies the roles of two-level systems, quasiparticles, and scattering processes, and connects these losses to wafer properties and fabrication methods.

      "summary": "We study a class of nonlocal conformal field theories in two dimensions which are obtained as deformations of the Virasoro minimal models. The construction proceeds by coupling a relevant primary operator $\\phi_{r,s}$ of the $m$-th minimal model to a generalized free field, in such a way that the interaction term has scaling dimension $2-\\delta$. Flowing to the infrared, we reach a new class of CFTs that we call long-range minimal models. In the case $r=s=2$, the resulting line of fixed points, parametrized by $\\delta$, can be studied using two perturbative expansions with different regimes of validity, one near the mean-field theory end, and one close to the long-range to short-range crossover. This is due to a straightforward generalization of an infrared duality which was proposed for the long-range Ising model ($m = 3$) in 2017. We find that the large-$m$ limit is problematic in both perturbative regimes, hence nonperturbative methods will be required in the intermediate range for all values of $m$. For the models based on $\\phi_{1,2}$, the situation is rather different. In this case, only one perturbative expansion is known but it is well behaved at large $m$. We confirm this with a computation of infinitely many anomalous dimensions at two loops. Their large-$m$ limits are obtained from both numerical extrapolations and a method we develop which carries out conformal perturbation theory using Mellin amplitudes. For minimal models, these can be accessed from the Coulomb gas representations of the correlators. This method reveals analytic expressions for some integrals in conformal perturbation theory which were previously only known numerically."

      "summary": "We propose a deterministic single-photon source in the terahertz (THz) regime, triggered by a sequence of coherent optical pulses. The scheme leverages the permanent dipole moment of a single-polar quantum emitter to induce THz transitions between optically dressed states, enhanced by a resonant coupling to a hybrid THz cavity. We present a cavity design that delivers high efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability while also enabling easy tunability of the emission frequency across the THz range. A key challenge in this new class of dressed-state sources is that, unlike standard solid-state single-photon sources, the dressed nature of the transitions can lead to undesired optical repumping during emission due to spontaneous photon emission in the visible range, which reduces the purity of the THz single-photon state. We show that this issue can be mitigated through optimized pulse areas and a sufficiently high Purcell rate, criteria that are met by our proposed cavity design. Finally, we demonstrate the significant purity enhancement of postselected THz photons by means of optical heralding, illustrating the new opportunities unlocked by the unique integration of terahertz and visible technologies with dressed polar quantum emitters."

Our derivation is elementary, allowing us to easily reproduce and generalize constraints on displacement and tilt operators previously obtained in the literature as well as a plethora of new ones, including constraints on bulk-defect correlation functions. For line defects we rewrite constraints in dispersive sum rule form, showing they lead to exact, optimal bounds on the OPE data of the defect. We test these sum rules in concrete perturbative examples, finding perfect agreement with existing calculations and making new predictions for various dCFT data."

      "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced \"critical point\"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools."

These symmetries are realised holographically via Maxwell-type theories for massless and massive $p$-forms in AlAdS spacetimes. Double-trace deformations of the boundary theory are considered. While massless theories describe systems with conserved higher-form current, the massive case provides a controlled linearised framework for explicit symmetry breaking induced by defects and charged operators. We perform holographic renormalisation and establish a unified holographic dictionary across a broad theory space, parametrised by spacetime dimension, form rank, quantisation scheme and deformation scale. We compute thermal correlation functions in isotropic black brane backgrounds to characterise the hydrodynamic and quasihydrodynamic regimes of the dual boundary theories. Our analysis reveals a rich structure of relaxation dynamics, emergent photons and duality relations -- including the conventional electric-magnetic Hodge duality and its massive counterpart. These results extend bottom-up holography to include weakly broken higher-form symmetries and open avenues for exploring generalised self-duality constraints and new classes of deformed holographic duals."

      "summary": "We describe a two-dimensional model for active particles whose self-propulsion speed is not fixed, but varies in time, and whose motion is subject to both translational and rotational diffusion. In the conventional treatment of active Brownian motion, the self-propulsion speed is taken to be constant - an assumption convenient for analysis but poorly matched to many real systems. Here we relax that assumption, allowing the speed $v(t)$ to fluctuate stochastically between two values: $v=0$ (a passive state) and $v=s$ (an active state). Transitions between these states are taken to follow a random telegraph process. This ``active-passive Brownian particle'' inherits limiting behaviors from both the purely active and purely passive Brownian cases. Analytical expressions for the first two displacement moments, and for the resulting effective diffusion coefficient, make this dual character explicit. Moreover, by an appropriate identification of parameters, a run-and-tumble particle - such as a motile bacterium - can be mapped onto this model in such a way that their large-scale diffusivities coincide."

This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain observed KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating our model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying a fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena."

      "summary": "In classical inviscid fluids, antiparallel vortices perturbed by Kelvin waves exhibit the Crow instability, where the mutual interaction of the Kelvin modes renders them dynamically unstable. This results in the approach and reconnection of the vortices, leading to a cascaded decay into ever-smaller vortex loops. Through mean-field simulations we study the Crow instability of quantum vortex lines in a superfluid whose atoms are subject to the anisotropic, long-ranged dipole-dipole interaction. We observe that the direction of dipole polarization plays a crucial role in determining the dynamically favored Kelvin modes. The subsequent rate of the instability is linked to the mediation of the vortex curvature by the effective dipole-dipole interaction between the vortices themselves. The vortex curvature is strongly suppressed and modes of lower wavenumber are preferred when the dipole polarization is parallel to the vortices, whereas the curvature is maximized for polarizations along the vortices' separation axis. For polarizations along the binormal axis, modes of higher wavenumber are favorable but the instability rate is considerably inhibited. This paves the way to a deeper understanding of vortex reconnections, vortex loop cascades and turbulence in dipolar superfluids."

Quintet and triplet states play crucial roles, particularly in SF systems, necessitating a precise monitoring and control of their spin dynamics. Spin states in intramolecular SF (iSF) are of particular interest, but tuning these systems to control triplet multiplication pathways has not been extensively studied. Additionally, whilst studies in this context focus on participation of triplet pathways leading to photoluminescence, emission pathways via quintet states remain largely unexplored. Here, we employ a set of unique spin-sensitive techniques to investigate high-spin state formation and emission in dimers and trimers comprising multiple diphenylhexatriene (DPH) units. We demonstrate the formation of pure quintet states in all these oligomers, with high-spin state optical emission via quintet states dominating delayed fluorescence up to room temperature. For triplet formation, we distinguish between the ability to form weakly exchange-coupled triplet pairs and the efficiency-reducing pathway of intersystem crossing (ISC), identifying the trimer Me-(DPH)$_3$ as the only oligomer exhibiting exclusively the desired SF pathways. Conversely, linear (DPH)$_3$ and (DPH)$_2$ show additional or exclusive triplet pathways via ISC. Our comprehensive analysis provides a detailed investigation into high-spin state formation, control, and emission in intramolecular singlet fission systems."

The dissipative dynamics arising from interactions with an external environment are modeled using two distinct theoretical frameworks: the standard Lindblad master equation and a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian approach. We derive the full Liouvillian superoperator for both formalisms, revealing a crucial distinction: while the Lindblad equation accounts for both state decay and repopulation via quantum jumps, the non-Hermitian formalism only captures the decay, leading to non-conservation of the total system probability."

Using unbiased finite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond mean-field approaches to determine the ground state order parameter as a function of RSOC and phonon frequency. Our results reveal that the Rashba metal is unstable due to particle-hole instabilities, favoring the emergence of a CDW phase for any RSOC value. In the limit of a pure Rashba hopping, the model exhibits a distinct behavior with the appearance of four Weyl cones at half-filling, where quantum phase transitions are expected to occur at strong interactions. Indeed, a quantum phase transition, belonging to the Gross-Neveu Ising universality class between a semi-metal and CDW emerges at finite phonon frequency dependent coupling $\\lambda_c$. In the antiadiabatic limit we observe an enhanced symmetry in the infrared that unifies SC and CDW orders. These results advance our understanding of competing CDW and SC phases in systems with spin-orbit coupling, providing insights that may help clarify the behavior of related materials."

However, nearly flat band materials with vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain how to understand the disorder effects and what quantities determine the characteristic length scales in the system. In the clean limit, it is expected that the bulk transport is absent. In this work, we demonstrate, with a diamond lattice, that disorder can induce diffusion transport in a flat-band system with finite quantum metric. As disorder increases, the bulk transmission channels are activated, and the conductance reaches a maximum before decays inversely with disorder strength. Importantly, via the calculation of the wave-packet dynamics numerically, we show that the quantum metric determines the diffusion length of the system. Analytically, we show that the interplay between the disorder and quantum geometry gives rise to an effective Fermi velocity, as captured by the self-consistent Born approximation. The diffusion coefficient is identified from the Bethe-Salpeter equation under the ladder approximation. Our results reveal a disorder-driven delocalization mechanism in flat-band systems with finite quantum metric which cannot be understood by well-established theories of quantum diffusion. Our theory is important for understanding the disorder effects and transport properties of flat band materials such as twisted bilayer graphene which are current under intense investigation."

      "summary": "There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e(\\bf{r})$ and $\\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\bf{r})$, since the two forms of the kinetic energy, $\\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla \\Psi|^2$ and $-\\frac{1}{2}\\Psi\\nabla^2 \\Psi$, lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise for interactions. This paper considers the ground state of a system of many interacting particles in an external potential, and presents a resolution in steps. 1) For the kinetic energy all effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions of position $\\bf{r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n(\\bf{r})$ and are equivalent to an effective single-particle problem with wavefunction $s(\\bf{r}) = \\sqrt{n(\\bf{r})/N}$. 2) Interactions can be considered as potentials acting on particles or interaction fields, e.g., the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields. In each case, there is a mean field part that is a function of the density and a part due to correlation that is uniquely defined. 3) The final results follow from the nature of energy and stress. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the kinetic energy must involve $-\\frac{1}{2}s\\nabla^2 s$ and interactions in terms of potentials. This leads to density functional theory interpreted as energy density $e(\\bf{r})$ equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential at all points $\\bf{r}$. However, stress is related to forces, and the only acceptable expressions for the stress field involve the combination $\\frac{1}{2}[s\\nabla^2 s - |\\nabla s|^2]$, and Coulomb interactions in terms of electric fields. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments."

It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons."

      "summary": "The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is the workhorse method to study excitons in materials. The BSE Hamiltonian size, which depends on how many valence-to-conduction band transitions are considered, needs to be chosen to be sufficiently large to converge excitons' energies and wavefunctions but should be minimized to make calculations tractable, as BSE calculations are expensive and scale with the number of atoms as $\\mathcal{O}(N_{\\rm{atoms}}^6)$. In particular, in the case of supercell (SC) calculations composed of $N_{\\rm{rep}}$ replicas of a primitive cell (PC), a natural choice to build this BSE Hamiltonian is to include all transitions derived from PC calculations by zone folding. However, this leads to a very large BSE Hamiltonian, as the number of matrix elements in it is $(N_k N_c N_v)^2$, where $N_k$ is the number of $k$-points and $N_{c(v)}$ is the number of conduction (valence) states used. When creating a SC, the number of $k$-points decreases by a factor $N_{\\rm{rep}}$ but both the number of conduction and valence states increase by the same factor, therefore the number of matrix elements in the BSE Hamiltonian increases by a factor $N_{\\rm{rep}}^2$, making exactly corresponding calculations prohibitive. Here, we provide a workflow to decide how many transitions are necessary to achieve comparable results, based on only PC results. With our method, we show that to converge the first exciton binding energy of a LiF SC composed of 64 PCs, to an energy tolerance of 0.15 eV, we only need 12\\% of the valence-to-conduction matrix elements that result from zone folding with a minimal set of bands. As an example, we use the number of bands from our method to obtain the absorption spectrum of LiF with a V$_k$-like defect. The procedure in our work helps in evaluating excitonic properties in large SC calculations."

      "summary": "Superconductivity has been demonstrated in the family of multi-layered nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Key questions remain open regarding the low-energy electronic states that support superconductivity in these compounds. Here we take advantage of the natural polymorphism between bilayer (2222) and alternating monolayer-trilayer (1313) stacking sequences that arises in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ crystals, and by employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we identify a universal low-energy electronic structure in this family of materials. We observe the fingerprint of a doping-dependent spin-density wave (SDW) instability -- strong and coherent enough to reconstruct the Fermi surface, both by gapping out regions of the low-energy electronic structure as well as translating the $\\beta$ pocket by a vector $Q_{t\\beta}$ consistent with the results of previous neutron and x-ray scattering experiments. Using an effective tight-binding model, we simulate the spectral weight distribution observed in our ARPES dichroism experiments and establish that the low-energy electronic phenomenology is dominated by oxygen-centered planar orbitals, which evolve from the $d_{3x^2-r^2}$ and $d_{3y^2-r^2}$ symmetry characteristic of 3-spin polarons (3SP) to the familiar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Zhang-Rice singlets (ZRS) that support high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. By inclusion of magnetic moments on plaquettes of oxygen orbitals in our model, we show that ZRS-like states mediate the SDW. Combined with the observation that oxygen annealing is required to induce superconductivity in both thin films and bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, this demonstrates that the ZRS population dictates whether the ground state favors density-wave order or superconductivity -- with hole doping suppressing the former and stabilizing the latter, as in the cuprates."

In this paper, we review this theory in the context of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods. The initial configurations of the rods are sampled from a probability distribution characterised by slowly varying conserved density profiles across space. Beginning from a microscopic description, we first formulate the macroscopic fluctuation theory in terms of the phase-space density of quasiparticles. In the second part, we apply this framework to compute the two-point, two-time correlation functions of the conserved densities in the Euler scaling limit. We derive an explicit expression for the correlation function which not only reveals its inherent symmetries, but is also straightforward to evaluate numerically for a given initial state. Our results also recover known expressions for space-time correlations in equilibrium for the hard-rod gas."

We investigate phase stability, nanostructure design, and mechanical behavior of Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$ thin films deposited on MgO(001) substrates using ion-assisted reactive magnetron sputtering. Compared to growth temperature and ion assistance, backscattered Ar neutrals are shown to have a dominant influence on the film structure. The Al-rich (x > 0.41) films form a nanocrystalline morphology consisting of Hf- and Al-rich nanodomains in a wurtzite-hexagonal(h) 0001 fiber-texture exhibiting about 22 GPa hardness, considerably higher than that of a binary AlN. For low Al contents, x directions and the size increases linearly from 9 to 13 A with rising Al content. Consequently, the nanoindentation hardness increases sharply from 26 GPa for HfN$_y$, to \\~38 GPa for c-Hf$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N$_y$, due to dislocation pinning at the superstructure strain fields. Micropillar compression of c-Hf$_{0.93}$Al$_{0.07}$N$_{1.15}$ shows a considerably higher yield stress compared to HfN$_y$ and controlled brittle fracture occurs via {110} slip systems, attributed to superstructure inhibited dislocation motion. In contrast, nanocrystalline h-Hf$_{0.59}$Al$_{0.41}$N$_{1.23}$ exhibits a high yield stress and limited plasticity before strain burst failure."

The RHE is a second-order response with respect to the electromagnetic field amplitude. It consists of a nonzero photocurrent due to the breaking of the system's inversion symmetry driven by the combined action of the in-plane time-dependent electric field and a spatial modulation of the critical temperature. We explore a means to control the electric current by the polarization of the external field accompanied by a non-linear Hall effect of fluctuating Cooper pairs caused by circularly polarized irradiation. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivity tensor exhibits a higher-power dependence on the reduced temperature compared to that of the conventional Aslamazov-Larkin correction (or other fluctuating second-order nonlinear responses). It results in a dramatic enhancement of the non-linear Hall response of fluctuating Cooper pairs in the vicinity of the superconducting criticality."

      "summary": "Brownian motion near soft surfaces is a situation widely encountered in nanoscale and biological physics. However, a complete theoretical description is lacking to date. Here, we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a two-dimensional colloid in an arbitrary external potential and near a soft surface. The latter is minimally modelled by a Winkler's foundation, and we restrict the study to the colloidal motion in the direction perpendicular to the surface. We start from deterministic hydrodynamic considerations, by invoking the already-established leading-order soft-lubrication forces acting on the particle. Importantly, a negative softness-induced and position-dependent added mass is identified. We then incorporate thermal fluctuations in the description. In particular, an effective Hamiltonian formulation is introduced and a temperature-dependent generalized potential is constructed in order to ensure equilibrium properties for the colloidal position. From these considerations and the Fokker-Planck equation, we then derive the relevant Langevin equation, which self-consistently allows to recover the deterministic equation of motion at zero temperature. Interestingly, besides an expected multiplicative-noise feature, the noise correlator appears to be modified by the surface softness. Moreover, a softness-induced temperature-dependent spurious drift term has to be incorporated within the Ito prescription. Finally, using numerical simulations with various initial conditions and parameter values, we statistically analyze the trajectories of the particle when placed within a harmonic trap and in presence of the soft surface. This allows us to: i) quantify further the influence of surface softness, through the added mass, which enhances the velocity fluctuations; and ii) show that intermediate-time diffusion is unaffected by softness, within the assumptions of the model."

      "summary": "Low-symmetry surfaces of topological semimetals provide access to boundary phenomena hidden on conventional facets, yet systematic studies remain scarce due to experimental challenges and the lack of a general framework for reconciling bulk and surface periodicities. Inspired by experimental observations on the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, which reveal an apparent mismatch between the surface Brillouin zone and bulk-projected Weyl points, we establish a least common multiple criterion for surface commensuration. We show that successive bulk Brillouin zones generate laterally shifted replicas that only close after three unit cells, giving rise to a momentum-space moire modulation and thereby resolving the apparent breakdown of bulk-boundary correspondence. Density functional theory slab calculations based on this three-cell supercell, together with Green's function methods that naturally incorporate multiple bulk zones, quantitatively reproduce the experiment. Beyond NdAlSi, the least common multiple framework provides a universal prescription for reconciling bulk and surface states on arbitrary facets, suggesting that overlapping Fermi arcs may hybridize into closed loops and enabling unconventional transport and interference phenomena unique to low-symmetry surfaces, accompanied by emergent moire patterns in momentum space."

Despite its significant potential, experimental investigations of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of Mn_3Ir have been greatly hindered by the formidable challenges in growing bulk single crystals. Here, we report the growth of stoichiometric Mn_3Ir bulk single crystals and their characterization in terms of magnetization and the AHE. Using a high-throughput flux method, we obtained (111)-oriented hexagonal Mn_3Ir single crystals. A small AHE signal was detected, which we attribute to the coexistence of A- and B-type antiferromagnetic domains that mutually cancel the net AHE response. Our results reveal key aspects of the intrinsic magnetic properties and AHE in bulk Mn_3Ir, providing a critical material platform for the development of advanced spintronic devices."

We clearly observed the Fermi surface (FS) and band dispersion in good agreement with the previous reports. Moreover, the ARPES band dispersion reveals a distinct kink structure around 68 meV, providing the first spectroscopic evidence for the elementary excitations in CrO2. The energy scale of this feature is comparable to the Debye temperature and the $A\\subm{1g}$ phonon mode, suggesting the electron-phonon interaction. From the detailed analysis, we have extracted the self-energy and found two characteristic structures in the real part of the self-energy. Assuming the existence of the electron-magnon interaction as well as the electron-phonon interaction, we could reproduce the evaluated real and imaginary parts of the self-energy as well as ARPES intensity. Our findings reveal the renormalized quasiparticle (QP) dynamics in CrO$_2$ and provide valuable insights into the fundamental many-body interactions governing half-metallic ferromagnets."

      "summary": "Vitrimers are an emerging class of crosslinked polymer networks in which dynamic covalent bonds can exchange and rearrange, without any significant change in population of bonded states.1 Because these bonds can rearrange at high temperatures without disintegration of the network, vitrimers could combine the mechanical stability of traditional permanently crosslinked networks with the recyclability of glasses and physical networks. However, unlike classical transient/physical networks, vitrimers can relax at a rate that is decoupled from the mobility of their polymer segments. This challenges our fundamental understanding of how dynamic covalent networks relax and deform. Here we combine simulations, theory, and experiments to show that vitrimer dynamics exhibit two very different regimes: (i) a high temperature regime controlled by the local bond-exchange reaction rate and (ii) a low temperature regime controlled by segmental diffusion. This fundamental difference from traditional physical networks explains why vitrimers can exhibit Arrhenius dynamics, providing a foundation for their rational design."

As concrete examples, we consider $\\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase. The relative importance of non-local vs. local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states: closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic field."

      "summary": "Polar metals are an underexplored material class combining two properties that are typically incompatible, namely a polar crystal structure and reasonable electrical conductivity. While intriguing given that metals favor centrosymmetry, these materials also exhibit potential functional properties relevant to memory, optoelectronic, catalytic, and other applications. The distortive polar metal (DPM) subclass forms through a centrosymmetry-lifting phase transformation into a polar crystal structure. In the process, domains with uniform geometric polar directions form, oftentimes separated by domain boundaries with polarity discontinuities arranged in \"charged\" head-to-head (H-H) or tail-to-tail (T-T) morphologies. To date, only metallic oxide DPM microstructures have been studied. Here we reveal in the intermetallic DPM Mn5Al8 different chemical reactivity and surface interactions at domain boundaries depending on their H-H or T-T character. Variable surface electron-transfer reactivity suggests localized changes in electronic work functions due to an increase (H-H) or depletion (T-T) in the electronic density of states. This behavior is unintuitive in a metal where electrostatic de-polarizing fields should not account for fluctuations in carrier densities. These findings suggest that metallic DPMs may offer functionalizable domain boundary behavior and deserve increased attention. Metallic DPMs allow highly tunable chemistries that can undergo various thermomechanical processing and transformation protocols. Ultimately, this study marks a milestone in metal physics and uncovers novel intermetallic properties, propelling the discovery and design of advanced electronic materials and devices."

We show that for weakly interacting systems such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The transition rates between system states, which characterize the process, are determined by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Furthermore, we investigate the time dependence of the mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that, under the given assumptions, it is governed by the Boltzmann collision integral. The proposed mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution is non-coherence. In the presented theory, the non-coherence is not associated with interaction with a heat bath, but rather with the finite spectral width of quantum states. This understanding of non-coherence is analogous to the one used in wave optics. Thus, we present a novel approach to the famous arrow of time problem."

Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose {the Triadic Perceptron Model (TPM)} that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we formulate the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to extract triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to climate."

Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson."

One of the best-known examples of holography is the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Despite extensive work on holographic thermodynamics, heat engines for CFT thermal states have not been explored. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles. The efficiency of most heat engines can be derived from the CFT equation of state, which follows from scale invariance, and we compare them to the efficiencies for an ideal gas. However, the Stirling efficiency for a generic CFT is uniquely determined in terms of its characteristic temperature and volume only in the high-temperature or large-volume regime. We derive an exact expression for the Stirling efficiency for CFT states dual to AdS-Schwarzschild black holes and compare the subleading corrections in the high-temperature regime with those in a generic CFT."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: In statistical physics, the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism is used to derive an integro-differential equation for observables in a Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. However, the well-posedness of the abstract Cauchy problem for the orthogonal dynamics remains an open problem. Moreover, it is rarely discussed under which assumptions the Dyson identity, which is used to derive the GLE, holds. In this article, we address this issue for rank-one projections (Mori's projection). For the Mori projection, the orthogonal dynamics is obtained from the bounded perturbation theorem. The variation of constants formula for strongly continuous semigroups then yields the GLE and the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT). We show that the variation of constants can be replaced by a limiting process in order to give a general proof of the GLE and 2FDT that does not require the differentiability of the fluctuating forces. In addition, we offer an alternative approach that does not require the bounded perturbation theorem. Our starting point is the observation that the GLE and 2FDT uniquely determine the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. Furthermore, the orbit maps for the orthogonal dynamics can be directly defined via solutions of linear Volterra equations. All desired properties of the orthogonal dynamics are then proven directly from this definition. In particular, the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\\overline{\\mathcal{QL}}\\mathcal{Q}=\\mathcal{QLQ}$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\\mathcal{P}=1-\\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup."

In the thermodynamic limit, the system is in the area-law phase for any monitoring strength, however we can also study the distribution in the critical phase characterized by a logarithmic scaling of the EE with system size by considering a sufficiently weak monitoring strength. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero, likely a precursor of Zeno effect, that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength. Intriguingly, the distribution is spatially inhomogeneous. For sites around the boundary separating the subsystems defining the EE, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. As the monitoring strength increases, the full distribution is controlled by the boundary sites. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, where the change in EE is defined between two consecutive time steps, the distribution, Gaussian for weak monitoring, gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. For strong monitoring, the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect."

Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments."

These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols."

We introduce two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting on the ground states. These operators generate the $B$- or $C$-type Lie algebras, depending on whether the number of sites $N$ is odd or even, respectively, with rank $n=\\lceil N/2\\rceil$. The third component of the total spin operator can be represented as a sum of the Cartan subalgebra elements and some central element. In the $C$-type Lie algebra case (even number of sites), this representation coincides with a similar formula previously conjectured for spin-$1$ operators, in the context of the periodic Motzkin chain."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Quantum simulations of metal surfaces are critical for catalytic innovation. Yet existing methods face a cost-accuracy dilemma: density functional theory is efficient but system-dependent in accuracy, while wavefunction-based theories are accurate but prohibitively costly. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a systematically improvable quantum embedding framework that resolves this challenge by capturing partially filled electronic states in metals. FEMION combines auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo for local catalytic sites with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, yielding a scalable approach across diverse catalytic systems. Employing FEMION, we address two longstanding challenges: determining the preferred CO adsorption site and quantifying the H2 desorption barrier on Cu(111). Furthermore, our calculations demonstrate that the recently discovered 10-electron-count rule can also be extended to the single-atom catalysis processes on 3d metal surfaces, resolving the controversies arising from density functional theory calculations. We thus open a predictive, first-principles route to modeling complex catalytic systems."

We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\\mathcal{O}(\\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions."

This study presents a cooling strategy centered on the heterogeneous integration of gallium oxide devices with cubic boron arsenide ( c -BAs).

This work highlights c -BAs as an outstanding material for cooling tomorrow’s chips, and may facilitate the engineering of interfacial thermal transport at the atomic scale. [Phys. Rev.

      "summary": "Nature Materials, Published online: 29 September 2025; doi:10.1038/s41563-025-02354-z Advances have been made in thin-film piezoelectrics; however, the linearity of electric-field-induced strain with frequency and temperature still requires improvement. Here, by growing interlocked monoclinic and tetragonal polar nanoregions in (K,Na)NbO3 thin films, highly linear strains of up to 1.1% are reported at frequencies up to 105 Hz."
