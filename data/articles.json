      "summary": "At low temperature T we expect vacuum tunneling processes to occur in superfluid $^{4}$ He films. We distinguish between extrinsic processes, in which single vortices nucleate by tunneling off boundaries in the system, and intrinsic processes, in which vortex/anti-vortex pairs nucleate far from boundaries. It is crucial to incorporate the varying effective mass of the vortex in tunneling calculations. The intrinsic processes are the superfluid analogue of the Schwinger mechanism in quantum field theory; here they appear as a quantum phase transition at T = 0, driven by an external supercurrent. We calculate the tunneling rate for these processes, and describe a means of testing the predictions using a specific vortex counting experiment."

      "summary": "Inspired by the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, we present exact solutions for a spin-1 chain with Kitaev-like couplings. We consider an expanded Kitaev model with bilinear and biquadratic terms. At an exactly solvable point, the Hamiltonian can be reexpressed as a sum of projection operators. Unlike the AKLT model where projectors act on total spin, we project onto components of spin along the bond direction. This leads to exponential ground state degeneracy, expressed in terms of fractionalized spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ objects. Each ground state can be expressed concisely as a matrix product state. We construct a phase diagram by varying the relative strength of bilinear and biquadratic terms. The fractionalized states provide a qualitative picture for the spin-1 Kitaev model, yielding approximate forms for the ground state and low-lying excitations."

      "summary": "The newly discovered kagome superconductor CsCr3Sb5 exhibits distinct features with flat bands and unique magnetism, providing a compelling platform for exploring novel quantum states of correlated electron systems. Emergent charge order in this material is a key for understanding unconventional superconductivity, but it remains unexplored at the atomic scale and the underlying physics is elusive. Here, we identify and unreported stripe orders on the surface which are distinct from the bulk and investigate the underlying bulk electronic properties using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, a mixture of 2a0 * a0 and 3a0 * a0 stripe order is found on Cs-terminated surface while 4a0 * root3a0 stripe order is found on the Sb-terminated surface. The electronic spectra exhibit strongly correlated features resembling that of high temperature superconductors, with kagome flat bands lying about 330 meV above EF, suggesting that the electron correlations arise from Coulomb interactions and Hund's coupling. Moreover, a distinct electron-boson coupling mode is observed at approximately 100 meV. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between surface and bulk charge orders in this strongly correlated kagome system."

      "summary": "Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) is a well-established tool for probing excitations in a wide range of materials. The measured spectra strongly depend on the scattering geometry, via its influence on the polarization of the incoming and outgoing light. By employing a tensor representation of the 4-point response function that governs the RIXS intensity, we disentangle the experimental geometry from the intrinsic material properties. In dipole-dipole RIXS processes and low-symmetry crystals, up to 81 linearly independent fundamental spectra can be measured as a function of light polarization. However, for crystals or molecules with symmetry, the number of independent fundamental spectra that define the RIXS tensor is significantly reduced. This work presents a systematic framework for determining the number of fundamental spectra and expressing the RIXS tensor in terms of these fundamental components. Given a specific experimental geometry, the measured spectrum can be represented as a linear combination of these fundamental spectra. To validate our approach, we performed calculations for different point group symmetries, both with and without an applied magnetic field. Within the same framework, we derived expressions for powder spectra in momentum-independent processes and spectra obtained using Bragg spectrometers. This formalism provides a valuable toolkit for optimizing experiment planning, data interpretation, and RIXS simulation."

      "summary": "In this paper the random packing fraction of binary similar hyperparticles with small size difference in D-dimensional Euclidean space RD is studied using two statistical geometry approaches. These geometric approaches, concerning orientation geometry and integral geometry, yield the excluded volume of particle pairs. The excluded volume of rectangles, based on orientation geometry, in Euclidean space R2 is used to derive an explicit equation for the bidisperse packing fraction, which is compatible with the expression published previously. Next, the excluded volume of pairs of convex particles in D = 2, 3 and 4 resulting from integral geometry are presented. These excluded volumes are identical with the specific ones for (sphero-)cylinders (D = 3) and rectangles (D = 2), derived by orientation geometry. Furthermore, these excluded volumes contain geometric measures: particle volume, surface area, mean curvature and the second quermassintegral. This allows the derivation of closed-form and generic expressions for the random packing fraction of binary convex hyperparticles in Euclidean spaces R2 , R3 and R4."

The interlayer hopping is weak and short ranged and the angles are chosen in a large measure set. The result provides a justification, in the above regime, to the effective continuum description of TBG in which large momenta interlayer interactions are neglected."

The ratio of these counts constrains the topology of the solution space. We apply this characterization to the spherical perceptron and show the existence of at least two topological regimes."

However, perfect spin Hall quantization is often hindered by spin mixing from strong spin-orbit coupling, and the emergence of such VHSs is highly sensitive to material-specific electronic structures. Here, we predict a class of seven-layered square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Mo/W, A = Si/Ge, Z = Pnictogen) isomers that host a robust, large-gap QSH phase with nearly quantized spin Hall conductivity and intrinsic high-order VHSs. Topological and symmetry analyses reveal that compounds with Z = P, As, and Sb are $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ nontrivial with spin Chern number $C_s = 1$ and support $S_z$-polarized edge states, while those with Z = N are trivial insulators. The QSH phase features an $S_z$-conserving spin Hamiltonian consistent with an emergent spin $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ quasi-symmetry, yielding spin Hall conductivity $\\sim 2e^2/h$. Notably, MA$_2$(As, Sb)$_4$ compounds exhibit quasi-flat bands near the Fermi level in the inverted regime, with WSi$_2$Sb$_4$ additionally hosting four high-order VHSs at generic momentum points. These results position square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials as robust QSH insulators for realizing quantized spin Hall conductivity and correlated topological phases, including fractionalized states and possibly non-Abelian anyons."

Ab-initio simulations reveal that optical excitation is capable of inducing a structural phase transition in NbOX$_2$ from the monoclinic ($C2$) ground state to the higher-symmetry ($C2/m$) structure. In the resulting transient high-symmetry state, an applied electric field breaks the residual inversion-symmetry degeneracy, selectively stabilizing one enantiomeric final state configuration over the other.

Hexagonal manganites provide a paradigmatic platform for such studies. These compounds exhibit a strongly coupled distortive-improper ferroelectric order, arising from trimerizing lattice distortions, and a 120{\\deg} noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure. While their two-dimensional domain topology has been extensively studied, the full three-dimensional multiferroic domain architecture has remained largely unexplored, mainly due to the experimental challenges of probing bulk structures beyond surfaces. Here, we employ a Landau free-energy framework combined with large-scale phase-field simulations to reveal the intricate three-dimensional multiferroic domain network of hexagonal manganites. We demonstrate that the coupling between the structural and antiferromagnetic order parameters gives rise to a rich variety of three-dimensional topological features. In particular, these features give rise to an attraction between different types of domain walls. Moreover, we identify bifurcations of vortex-like lines at domain-wall intersections, a phenomenon that can exist only in three dimensions and fundamentally alters the topology of the domain network. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical basis for understanding three-dimensional domain interactions in multiferroics and highlight the essential role of dimensionality in coupling improper ferroelectricity, magnetism, and topology in hexagonal manganites."

Thermomechanical noise fundamentally limits mechanical frequency stability, and its impact can be reduced with increased coherent amplitude of mechanical motion. However, large enough actuation places the resonator in the nonlinear (Duffing) regime, where conversion of amplitude noise (AM) into frequency noise (FM) can worsen sensor performance. Here, we present an experimentally straightforward method to evade this amplitude tradeoff in micromechanical sensors. Combining knowledge of the Duffing coefficients with readily available amplitude measurements, we avoid AM-FM conversion. Our approach uses dual-mechanical-mode operation on a tensioned thin-film resonator to set a baseline thermomechanically-limited stability by eliminating correlated single-mode frequency drifts. Thus, we cleanly observe AM-FM conversion at high drive, and reduce it using our method. The resulting high-stability operation beyond the linear regime contrasts long-standing perspectives in the field."

However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation, we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), a framework designed to capture long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be integrated with any existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. The central contribution of this work is the mapping of a linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier space, enabling the explicit modeling of long-range interactions such as electrostatics and dispersion without relying on predefined charges or other empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a long-range correction to the MACE backbone across diverse benchmarks, including dimer binding curves, dispersion-dominated layered phosphorene exfoliation, and the molecular dipole density of bulk water. Our results show that RSA consistently captures long-range physics across a broad range of chemical and materials systems.

      "summary": "Self-trapping is a hallmark phenomenon of nonlinear dynamics. It has significant applications in modern physics, including band structure engineering, phase transition dynamics, quantum metrology, and more. Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), in which self-trapping can arise from interatomic interactions, are a prime testbed for probing nonlinear dynamics. In this Letter, we report the observation of self-trapping in a spin-orbit coupled BEC subjected to a stationary optical lattice. We employ Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, complemented by a matching optical lattice that facilitates coupling between momentum eigenstates of the spin-orbit coupled system. By ramping the Raman detuning, we probe atomic current flow between these eigenstates and identify a clear distinction between a delocalized mixed state and a self-trapped regime. Following a quench of the Raman detuning, the time-averaged atomic current exhibits non-analytic behavior across the transition between these two regimes in certain parameter ranges, signaling a dynamical phase transition in the system."

      "summary": "Quantum droplets, stabilized by beyond-mean-field effects, represent a novel state of matter in quantum many-body systems. While previous studies have focused primarily on dipolar and contact-interacting systems, quadrupolar condensates remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we explore the formation, structural properties, and dynamical behaviors of quantum droplets in a two-component quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a quasi-two-dimensional geometry. Analytical results obtained via the Thomas-Fermi approximation predict flat-topped density profiles and linear scaling between effective area and particle number. These predictions are corroborated by numerical simulations, which also reveal the saturation of peak density and chemical potential at large norm. Furthermore, vortex quantum droplets exhibit anisotropic elliptical morphologies due to the directional nature of QQIs, with their aspect ratios significantly tunable by varying the particle number and quadrupolar interaction strength. Collision dynamics demonstrate rich behavior modulated by velocity and topology: ground-state droplets transition from inelastic merging to quasi-elastic scattering and quantum penetration, while vortex droplets exhibit phase-induced repulsion, fragmentation, and topologically protected tunneling. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order interactions and quantum fluctuations govern the formation and stability of quadrupolar droplets. This work lays a theoretical foundation for experimental realization and opens new directions for exploring anisotropic quantum fluids, topological excitations, and applications in quantum sensing and simulation."

      "summary": "Due to its peculiar superfluid-crystal duality feature, supersolid has received great research interest. Recently, researchers have paid much attention to its elastic response properties; however, the inelastic deformation has barely been explored. In this work, we study the transition from elastic to inelastic deformation of a dipolar supersolid Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a box potential (i.e., a dipolar supersolid with finite size). We obtained the stationary supersolid states (both ground and excited) of the system, and examined the relation between the supersolid size and the number of unit cells it can accommodate, which can essentially help us to understand the dynamical responses of the supersolid during a dilation or compression process. We found that within a certain dilation or compression extent, the supersolid can retain its original crystal structure, that is, it endures an elastic deformation; however, when the extent exceeds a critical threshold, the original crystal structure of the supersolid will be disrupted, which signifies an inelastic deformation. Furthermore, we both analytically and numerically determined the critical point of the transition from elastic to inelastic deformation, and mapped out a phase diagram. These results open up new territory in the research of supersolid mechanical properties, and may find applications in quantum material science and quantum-based technologies."

      "summary": "The accuracy of molecular simulations is fundamentally limited by the interatomic potentials that govern atomic interactions. Traditional potential development, which relies heavily on ab initio calculations, frequently struggles to reproduce the experimentally observed properties that govern real material behavior. To address this challenge, we present a machine learning-driven, active-learning optimization framework for optimizing classical interatomic potentials to reproduce experimental properties. Our method, here showcased on soda-lime borosilicate glasses, targets both global (density) and local (boron coordination) structural features across a wide range of compositions. By combining a surrogate model with iterative active learning, the framework efficiently explores a five-dimensional parameter space using only 400 molecular dynamics simulations over 17 iterations, making it highly data-efficient and eliminating the need for extensive simulation campaigns. Two transferable parameter sets are identified, each demonstrating good agreement with experimental measurements, including glass density, fraction of four-fold boron, and X-ray structure factor. The framework effectively captures and manages inherent trade-offs between structural objectives and compositional regimes, providing insights into the coordination behavior of boron in complex glass networks. The resulting classical force fields are generalizable and do not require reparameterization for individual compositions. Altogether, this work offers a scalable and experimentally grounded approach for developing transferable interatomic potentials suitable for a broad range of materials, including multi-component glass systems, and beyond."

This article highlights the physics, where peculiar quantum-mechanical mechanisms for the physical properties such as flatband ferromagnetism and flatband superconductivity that arise when the band is not trivially flat but has a strange Hilbert space with non-orthogonalisable Wannier states, which goes far beyond just the diverging density of states. Peculiar wavefunctions come from a quantum-mechanical interference and entanglement. Interesting phenomena become even remarkable when many-body interactions are introduced, culminating in flatband superconductivity as well as flatband ferromagnetism. Flatband physics harbours a very wide range physics indeed, extending to non-equilibrium physics in laser illumination, where Floquet states for topologcial superconductivity is promoted in flatbands. While these are theoretically curious, possible candidates for the flatband materials are beginning to emerge, which is also described. These provide a wide and promising outlook."

However, progress has been hampered by the limited number of candidate materials, which often suffer from poor stability and complex synthesis. Here, we introduce a new paradigm by exploring the emergent magnetism and nontrivial band topology in the largely overlooked family of two-dimensional (2D) pentagonal MN$_8$ monolayers. Employing first-principles calculations, we reveal that these systems host out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground states, a key feature that unlocks nontrivial topological properties driven by the localized $d$-orbitals of the embedded transition metals. Remarkably, we identify TiN$_8$ as a QAH insulator characterized by a Chern number of $C=-1$. Even more strikingly, MoN$_8$ is predicted to be a rare high-Chern-number QAH insulator, boasting a Chern number of $C=2$. Our findings establish the penta-MN$_8$ family as a fertile and versatile platform for realizing exotic topological quantum states. This work not only significantly expands the material landscape for magnetic topological insulators but also provides a solid theoretical foundation for designing next-generation spintronic and quantum computing devices."

      "summary": "Metastable alloys, such as $\\beta$-phase titanium (Ti) alloys with a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties through the interplay of multiple deformation mechanisms -- diffusionless phase transformations, deformation twinning, and conventional dislocation slip. However, understanding how these mechanisms compete or cooperate across a wide range of metastable alloys and loading conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the nucleation behavior of competing deformation modes in metastable $\\beta$-Ti alloys as a function of temperature, composition, and loading conditions. We reveal that twinning pathways emerge through reversible transformations between the $\\beta$ phase and the orthorhombic $\\alpha\"$ phase, in agreement with crystallographic theories. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that the dominant deformation mechanisms and preferred twinning-plane orientations are governed by two key energetic parameters: the free energy barrier for homogeneous $\\beta \\leftrightarrow \\alpha\"$ transformations and the misfit strain energy along specific phase boundaries. These energetic quantities vary systematically with thermodynamic and mechanical conditions, thereby rationalizing the deformation mode transitions observed in both simulations and experiments. These energetic metrics offer a physically grounded and computationally tractable basis for designing next-generation metastable alloys."

Here, we develop two machine learning potentials (MLPs) for SiO2 that faithfully represent the SCAN and PBEsol exchange-correlation functionals over a wide temperature (1000-10000 K) and pressure (100-400 GPa) range using deep neural networks. With large-scale two-phase simulations powered by these potentials, we determine the melting curves of seifertite and pyrite-type SiO2 and infer the solid-solid phase boundary between these two phases. The SCAN functional, which captures intermediate-range van der Waals interactions, reproduces structural and thermodynamic properties with high fidelity, predicting melting temperatures 6-10 % higher and a seifertite to pyrite-type transition pressure 22 % higher than the PBEsol. The strongly negative Clapeyron slope (-6.1 MPa/K) of this transition suggests that mantle convection could be highly layered in super-Earth exoplanets, potentially affecting their long-term thermal evolution and habitability."

Applying this principle to a minimal model of an information-driven swimmer, where feedback adaptively modulates viscous drag based on velocity measurements, we obtain analytical expressions for the mean velocity and higher-order cumulants. Here, we show that information-based feedback can sustain persistent motion even in dissipative environments, establishing a theoretical foundation for informational active matter and providing a systematic route for designing feedback-powered engines operating far from equilibrium."

      "summary": "Silica is the paradigmatic network glass-former and understanding its response to pressure is essential for comprehending the mechanical properties of silica-based materials and the behavior of silicate melts in the Earth's interior. While pressure-induced changes in the short-range structure - particularly the breakdown of tetrahedral symmetry - have been well documented, structural transformations on larger length scales, important for many material properties, remain poorly understood. Here, we numerically investigate the three-dimensional structure of silica glass as a function of compression up to $P \\approx 100$~GPa. Using a novel many-body correlation function, we reveal a complex medium-range order: While for $P \\lesssim 10$~GPa, one finds tetrahedral, octahedral, and cubic symmetries, the structure at higher $P$s exhibits alternating cubic and octahedral particle arrangements. The $P$-dependence of the corresponding structural correlation length displays two distinct maxima, which permits to rationalize the anomalous compressibility of silica. The identified complex structural organization on intermediate range scales is the result of a pressure-and scale-dependent interplay between directional bonding, packing efficiency, and network stiffness. Since these competing effects are common in network glass-formers, the identified three-dimensional medium-range order, and hence the physical properties of the glass, are expected to be universal features of such materials under extreme conditions."

      "summary": "Polar distortion, the collective off-center displacements of atoms, is a fingerprint of a ferroelectric that governs its properties and functionalities. Since the 1970s, the concepts of proper, improper and triggered ferroelectrics have been established to shed light on a diversity of polar distortion mechanisms. Such concepts assign a single nature to polar distortion and are helpful to interpret how polar distortions occur in conventional ferroelectrics such as barium titanate. However, applying these concepts to complex ferroelectrics (e.g., polar orthorhombic hafnia) is notoriously challenging and can yield highly controversial arguments. Here we resolve this issue by developing a tailor-made graph theory for clarifying the nature of polar distortions in complex ferroelectrics, which emphasizes that polar distortions in such ferroelectrics usually exhibit multiple natures among proper, improper and triggered characteristics. We demonstrate the robustness of our theory by working with perovsktie superlattices and polar orthorhombic hafnia (i.e., two representative cases). We successfully identify the mixed proper-improper nature in perovsktite superlattices and reconcile the controversy on polar orthorhombic hafnia by confirming its mixed trigger-improper nature. Our work will definitely lead to a revisitation of concepts in ferroelectric physics and provide opportunities for discovering novel ferroelectrics and related phenomena."

      "summary": "Owing to its high scalability and computational efficiency, machine learning methods have been increasingly integrated into various scientific research domains, including ab initio-based materials design. It has been demonstrated that, by incorporating modern machine learning algorithms, one can predict material properties with practically acceptable accuracy. However, one of the most significant limitations that restrict the widespread application of machine learning is its lack of transferability, as a given framework is typically applicable only to a specific property. The origin of this limitation is rooted in the fact that a material's properties are determined by multiple degrees of freedom -- and their complex interplay -- associated with nuclei and electrons, such as atomic type, structural symmetry, and the number and quantum states of the valence electrons, among others. The inherent complexity rules out the possibility of a single machine learning framework providing a full description of these critical quantities. In this paper, we develop a universal machine learning framework based solely on a physically grounded and theoretically rigorous descriptor -- electronic charge density. Our framework not only enables accurate prediction of eight different material properties (with R$^2$ values up to 0.94), but also demonstrates outstanding multi-task learning capability, as prediction accuracy improves when more target properties are incorporated into a single training process, thereby indicating excellent transferability. These results represent a significant step toward realizing the long-standing goal of a universal machine learning framework for the unified prediction of all material properties."

      "summary": "The search for thin film electro-optic (EO) materials that can retain superior performance under cryogenic conditions has become critical for quantum computing. Barium titanate thin films show large linear EO coefficients in the tetragonal phase at room temperature, which is severely degraded down to ~200 pm V$^{-1}$ in the rhombohedral phase at cryogenic temperatures. There is immense interest in manipulating these phase transformations and retaining superior EO properties down to liquid helium temperature. Utilizing the thermodynamic theory of optical properties, a large low-temperature EO response is designed by engineering the energetic competition between different ferroelectric phases, leading to a low-symmetry monoclinic phase with a massive EO response. The existence of this phase is demonstrated in a strain-tuned BaTiO$_{3}$ thin film that exhibits a linear EO coefficient of 2516 +/- 100 pm V$^{-1}$ at 5 K, which is an order of magnitude higher than the best reported performance thus far. Importantly, the EO coefficient increases by 100x during cooling, unlike the conventional films, where it degrades. Further, at the lowest temperature, significant higher order EO responses also emerge.

The impact of Cu dilution in the (liquid) Ga matrix is in-detail investigated by X-ray and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and Machine-Learned-Force Field (ML-FF) calculations. With decreasing Cu content, microscopic and macroscopic Ga-Cu model samples exhibit a shift of the Cu 2p core level line to higher binding energies (Eb) as well as a correspondingly shifted and narrowed d-band with respect to pure Cu, which we ascribe to site isolation. To study the property evolution of Ga-Cu at SCALMS reaction conditions, i.e., where Cu is present in liquid Ga, additional XPS measurements were performed between 100 and 500 oC. The observed Cu 2p shift to lower Eb is tentatively ascribed to changes in the local environment with increasing temperature, i.e. bond elongation, which is corroborated by ML-FF simulations. The increased Cu surface content at low temperatures is attributed to the presence of crystallized Cu-rich intermetallic compounds, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy images. In an attempt to generalize the findings for filled d-band transition metals (TMs) in liquid Ga also Ga-Ag and Ga-Au model systems were investigated. The observed insights may be another step of paving the way for an insight-driven development of low-temperature melting liquid metals for heterogeneous catalysis."

      "summary": "A secondary $\\beta$-relaxation process is often the dominant source of atomic dynamics below $T_\\mathrm{g}$ in many glass forming systems. Recent studies reported the presence of $\\beta$-relaxations in amorphous phase-change materials (PCMs) and showed that suppressing the $\\beta$-relaxation via annealing in Ge$_{15}$Sb$_{85}$ can effectively slow down its crystallization kinetics. Yet, when Sb is replaced by Te, similar annealing protocol has little effect on the Te-rich alloy Ge$_{15}$Te$_{85}$. Here, we investigate amorphous GeTe that is a Sb-free PCM, but with faster crystallization kinetics than Ge$_{15}$Te$_{85}$. Using powder mechanical dynamic spectroscopy, we observe a clear reduction of the excess-wing in the loss modulus upon isothermal annealing, indicating a suppression of its $\\beta$-relaxation. Ultrafast calorimetric analysis and time-resolved optical reflectivity measurements show that, whereas as-deposited GeTe exhibit stochastic crystallization behaviors, annealed samples crystallize more slowly with reduced stochasticity. Synchrotron X-ray scattering experiments reveal reinforced Peierls-like distortions in the amorphous structure after annealing, and demonstrate that, even if annealing introduces nucleation sites, it nonetheless slows down crystallization kinetics. These finding suggests that, in annealed GeTe, crystallization is limited by crystal growth rate, which is retarded through the suppression of $\\beta$-relaxation."

In this work, we directly probe the nonlinear exciton-exciton interactions of hybrid interlayer excitons. By applying an external out-of-plane electric field, we polarize the excitons to enhance their mutual dipolar interactions, thereby deliberately favoring these repulsive contributions over competing attractive manybody corrections. We furthermore establish a fully microscopic theoretical description of these effects to explain the core experimental results. The tuning results in a significantly larger blueshift compared to the zero-field case and perspectively opens an avenue to even switch between repulsive and attractive interaction potentials. Our findings establish that strong nonlinearities can be tuned via an external electric field, providing a new degree of control over exciton interactions beyond density tuning alone."

Here, we establish a spin-corner locking mechanism that generates second-order topological states in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems, through effective model analysis. Remarkably, the breaking of Mxy symmetry under uniaxial strain creates spin-resolved corner modes, driving the system into a corner-polarized second-order topological insulator (CPSOTI). Beyond critical strain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator occurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we identify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and Cr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the topological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism and higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling topological spintronics with cornertronics."

Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the ratio of interfacial to bulk diffusion uniquely determines the contact angle across the full hydrophilic-hydrophobic spectrum. This diffusion-based formulation eliminates the need for droplet geometries or free-energy sampling, enabling quantitative assessment of wetting directly from short ab-initio molecular dynamics trajectories. The approach provides a universal and efficient route to evaluate surface affinity in reactive, defective, or confined environments."

Experimental investigations in polycrystalline samples reveal that Sm doping monotonically decreases the lattice constants $c$ and $a$, thereby enhancing crystal structure distortion and leading to an evolution of the metallic ground state in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to an insulating state in La$_{1.5}$Sm$_{1.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The maximum onset $T_\\text{c}$ in compounds $x=0.9$ and 1.5 is 89 K, while the pressure that drives the emergence of superconductivity is higher for higher doping levels. The results suggest that the enhancement of $T_\\text{c}$ in La$_{3-x}$Sm$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is mainly affected by the compressed $c$ lattice before saturation, and the structure transition is critical for the emergence of superconductivity.

Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for reconfigurable chiral channels in next-generation quantum-optical devices."

We review different classes of physical models, from discrete to continuum models, and how they address key questions about the mechanics, signaling, and coordination of cells during wound closure. We highlight tensions between model complexity and interpretability and discuss recent efforts to bridge gaps across scales. Finally, we identify directions for hybrid modeling and model-experiment integration that could push forward our understanding of epithelial repair in development and disease."

      "summary": "We study the effect of the spatial distribution of active force dipoles on the folding pathways and mechanical stability of rigid-elastic networks using Langevin dynamics simulations. While it has been shown in Majumdar et al., J. Chem. Phys. 163, 114902 (2025) that a sharp collapse transition is evident in triangular (elastic) bead-spring networks under the action of contractile (or extensile) force dipoles distributed randomly across the network, here, we show that when the spatial distribution is correlated, e.g., like a patch in the center (``active core'' model) or a band-like distribution along the periphery (``active periphery'' model), the network undergoes only a partial decrease in size even at large forces, thereby showing an enhanced mechanical stability just from a spatial rearrangement of the active dipoles. Further, an active periphery network shows higher mechanical stability initially, for a range of forces, beyond which the active core network becomes more stable. Deformation in the network becomes irreversible beyond a threshold force, which depends on the type of distribution; for a uniform distribution of active dipoles, the irreversibility threshold almost coincides with the critical collapse point, it decreases for the active core system, and is decreased further for the active periphery system. It is shown that irreversibility arises due to plastic deformations in the form of crease formation which is not reversible even after the force is turned off or reversed. The folding pathways depend weakly on the temporal stochasticity of the active links, but are highly sensitive to any defects (missing bonds) in the network. Our findings, therefore, suggest active force localization (or delocalization) as a prime method to dynamically alter the mechanical stability and reversibility of the underlying elastic network."

This was shown for relatively high strains, whereas this is not the case at low strain values $<1\\%$ in which in this work, we observe the erratic dependency of the photoluminescence intensity at low strain values as a function of strain. We find that the dominant physical property is the dependence of the optical-dipole emission on the curvature of the substrate. We validate the behavior of the photoluminescence intensity with experimental angular emission spectroscopy (k-space imaging). These findings are supported by Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations, in agreement with the experimental data. Our findings present the importance of choosing the right substrate for flexible devices based on transition-metal dichalcogenides."

In this work, we present the growth of single-crystalline BaTiO3 thin films on Si, exhibiting imprint-free switching, low coercivity, high remanent polarization, and no fatigue for over $10^{10}$ switching cycles. We accomplish this via the insertion of a SrSn1-xTixO3 layer on SrTiO3-buffered Si. This layer serves as a pseudo substrate that alleviates the thermal strain that the Si substrates imposes on the BaTiO3 layer, while simultaneously providing moderate compressive strain that stabilizes a pure out-of-plane polarization. Thus, our work paves the way toward the fabrication of Si-compatible, low-power-consuming ferroelectric devices for non-volatile memory applications."

This study presents a systematic investigation of the effects of vacancy defect, specifically the role of nitrogen and constituent atom vacancies on the electronic properties of these materials. Our findings reveal that the introduction of nitrogen vacancies significantly alters the electronic characteristics of these materials. In h-BN, the presence of a nitrogen monovacancy significantly lowers the work function from 5.97 eV to 3.45 eV, one of the lowest values reported for any 2D material. Additionally, this defect reduces the band gap from 4.6 eV to 0.64 eV, driving the material toward half-metallic behavior. This is accompanied by the emergence of flat bands near the Fermi level, indicative of strong electron-electron interactions. In g-C$_3$N$_4$, nitrogen vacancies lead to a decrease in work function and band gap, with double nitrogen vacancies rendering the material nearly metallic. In BeN$_4$, nitrogen vacancies result in minimal charge redistribution and a slight increase in work function, highlighting the material's unique electronic behavior. These results underscore the potential of vacancy engineering in tuning the electronic properties of 2D nitride materials, offering avenues for the design of materials with tailored work functions and band gaps for applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and catalysis."

While conventional valley Hall effect requires the inversion symmetry breaking, the recently proposed nonlinear valley Hall (NVH) effect removes the symmetry constraint, and broaden material choices. However, existing studies are limited to nonmagnetic materials without spin involvement and rely on external strain to break rotational symmetry. Here, to address these limitations, we design a magnetically controllable NVH effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, by the tight-binding model and first-principles calculations. The model calculations demonstrate nonvanishing NVH conductivities can emerge in pristine hexagonal lattice without external strain, with the magnitude, sign, and spin polarization of the conductivities being all dependent on the magnetization orientation. The effect thus generates various spin-polarized valley Hall currents, characterized by distinct combinations of current direction and spin polarization. First-principle results on a ferromagnetic VSi$_2$N$_4$ bilayer confirm considerable NVH conductivities and their dependence on the magnetization. The magnetically controllable NVH effect unlocks the potential of centrosymmetric magnets for valleytronics, and offer opportunities for novel spintronic and valleytronic devices."

      "summary": "Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with its flat bands provides a rich platform for exploring emergent electronic orders. Similarly, periodically buckled monolayer graphene has been proposed as a tunable alternative for realizing flat bands. Here, we investigate the combined effect of buckling and twisting in bilayer graphene. We find that periodic buckling in large-angle TBG initially enhances band flattening compared to monolayer graphene, but for sufficiently strong buckling, it instead increases the band dispersion. This occurs both because of the presence of interlayer coupling, which reduces the in-plane kinetic energy, and due to the opening of a gap at the Dirac point resulting from inversion-symmetry breaking. Additionally, we find that buckling-induced band flattening competes with twist-induced band flattening. While the former breaks sublattice symmetry, generating a sublattice polarization, the latter prefers to preserve it. This prevents buckling from generating even flatter bands at the magic angle. Nevertheless, we find that buckled TBG can exhibit flatter bands than pristine TBG over a wide range of twist angles, with a flatness similar to that of pristine magic-angle TBG."

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), refractometry, and dielectric spectroscopy reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the nematic-isotropic transition temperature on particle concentration, indicating a competition between stabilizing and destabilizing effects. The order parameter increases with increasing nanoparticle content, in contrast to non-magnetic reference systems, suggesting an alignment effect induced by the magnetic rather than the geometric anisotropy axis of the dopants. Capacitance measurements of the Freedericksz transition show a pronounced shift in threshold fields, with a critical concentration marking a transition to enhanced magnetic responsiveness. Additional information on nanospindle diffusion correlated to the direction-dependent flow of the nematic host was inferred from comparison of Moessbauer spectroscopy and rheology data.

      "summary": "Inspired by the recent experimental progress in pyrochlore derivative \\ce{RE3Sb3A2O14 (A=Mg, Zn)}, we investigate the Hubbard model on the kagome lattice with an additional hopping $t'/t$, which enables continuous interpolation between the kagome and triangular lattices by using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We analyze the evolution of magnetic correlations and thermodynamic responses across different values of $t'/t$ and on-site interaction $U$. It is found that increasing $t'/t$ suppresses short-range antiferromagnetic correlations, while the next-nearest-neighbor correlations exhibit a sign change near $t'/t \\approx 0.3 \\text{--} 0.4$. Within this regime, the specific heat shows a pronounced low-temperature peak, indicating an emergent spin-related energy scale. Increasing $U$ enhances magnetic correlations and shifts the associated $t'/t$ crossover points to larger values. We also discuss the sign problem to clarify which parameter region of our numerical simulations is accessible and reliable. Our results uncover the competition between frustration and correlations and the interplay of magnetic and thermodynamic responses in the kagome lattice, providing insights into correlated states in frustrated materials."

      "summary": "Corrosion mechanism of minerals and glass is a critical study domain in geology and materials science, vital for comprehending material durability under various environmental conditions. Despite decades of extensive study, a core aspect of these mechanisms - specifically, the formation of amorphous alteration layers upon exposure to aqueous environments - remains controversial. In this study, the corrosion behavior of a boro-alumino-phospho-silicate glass (BAPS) was investigated using advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) and SEM techniques. The results reveal a uniform nanoscale phase separation into Al-P-rich and Al-Si-rich domains. During corrosion, the Al-P-rich domain undergoes gelation, whereas the Al-Si-rich domain remains vitreous, forming a gel layer comprised of both phases. Although SEM images show a sharp gel/glass interface - suggestive of a dissolution-precipitation mechanism - the phase coexistence within the gel layer provides definitive evidence against such a mechanism. Instead, we propose an in situ transformation mechanism governed by chemical reactions, involving: (i) preferential hydrolysis of Al-P-rich domain leading to porous gel regions; (ii) retention of Al-Si glass domains within the gel layer, with water infiltrating inter-network spaces; and (iii) selective leaching of phosphorus over aluminum, leading to reorganization of the gel network."

      "summary": "Two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper (2D) RP hybrid perovskites exhibit substantially higher chemical and structural stability than their three dimensional (3D) counterparts, positioning them as promising candidates for next generation optoelectronics. While quasiparticle dynamics in 3D perovskites are well studied, their 2D analogues remain comparatively underexplored. Here we systematically investigate the branching, dynamics, and interactions of free excitons (FEs) and exciton polarons EPs in monolayer 2D RP perovskites using visible range femtosecond transient absorption TA spectroscopy. We prepared monolayer 2D RP perovskite thin films with varied organic spacers and distinct fabrication routes for comparative analysis. We find that the EP binding energy is 50 65 meV in (BA)2PbI4 and 37 39 meV in (PEA)2PbI4, consistent with spacer layer dependent coupling as corroborated by FTIR. We reveal a dynamic equilibrium between FEs and EPs that persists for tens of picoseconds. Notably, the TA signatures differ by fabrication route films from the newly developed process show weaker Auger annihilation and a reduced hot phonon bottleneck than those from the conventional route trends consistent with fewer traps and impurities in the former. Coupled rate equation modeling reproduces the transients and quantifies the processes of hot carrier relaxation, exciton exciton annihilation, exciton phonon coupling, and FE EP interconversion. These results demonstrate that the chemical synthetic process (fabrication route) and spacer choice significantly influence EP stability and population balance, offering practical levers for engineering ultrafast photophysics in 2D perovskites and guiding the design of advanced optoelectronic devices."

The process gradually transforms a thermal ensemble of a noninteracting system into that of an interacting system of interest over a finite operation time, with the temperature controlled by parameters associated with the entropy of the initial state. We analyze this process in both nonintegrable and integrable spin chains with translational invariance. For the nonintegrable case, numerical simulations show that the thermal properties of local observables are accurately reproduced with a single parameter in the high temperature regime, although the operation time increases exponentially with precision. In contrast, for the integrable transverse-field Ising model, we analytically show that an extensive number of parameters tied to local conserved quantities is generally necessary, and that the operation time increases linearly with system size, diverging in the thermodynamic limit. These results clarify the potential and limitations of the quasi-adiabatic thermal process for an ensemble preparation and highlight the role of integrability in determining its efficiency."

      "summary": "Properties of quantum dot based spin qubits have significant inter-device variability due to unavoidable presence of various types of disorder in semiconductor nanostructures. A significant source of this variability is charge disorder at the semiconductor-oxide interface, which causes unpredictable, yet, as we show here, correlated fluctuations in such essential properties of quantum dots like their mutual tunnel couplings, and electronic confinement energies. This study presents a systematic approach to characterize and mitigate the effects of such disorder. We utilize finite element modeling of a Si/SiGe double quantum dot to generate a large statistical ensemble of devices, simulating the impact of trapped interface charges. This work results in a predictive statistical model capable of generating realistic artificial data for training machine learning algorithms. By applying Principal Component Analysis to this dataset, we identify the dominant modes through which disorder affects the multi-dimensional parameter space of the device. Our findings show that the parameter variations are not arbitrary, but are concentrated along a few principal axes - i.e.there are significant correlations between many properties of the devices. We finally compare that against control modes generated by sweeping the gate voltages, revealing limitations of the plunger-only control. This work provides a framework for enhancing the controllability and operational yield of spin qubit devices, by systematically addressing the nature of electrostatic disorder that leads to statistical correlations in properties of double quantum dots."

In contrast to the standard BG model, we suppose here that the time-evolution of the position components is driven not by Gaussian white-noises, but by two statistically-independent dichotomous noises. We calculate analytically the position variances and cross-correlations, as well as the mean angular momentum, which permits us to establish the conditions in which a spontaneous rotational motion of the particle around the origin takes place. We also present a numerical analysis of the mean angular velocity. Lastly, we calculate analytically some marginal position probability density functions revealing a remarkably rich behavior that emerges in such a system of two coupled linear stochastic differential equations. We show that depending on the values of parameters characterizing noises these distributions approach the steady-state forms defined on a finite support, having very unusual shapes, possessing multiple maxima and minima, plateaus and exhibiting a discontinuous behavior."

However, the underlying, material-specific, microscopic mechanisms often remain unclear. Here, we unveil a high-temperature incommensurate charge-order precursor with the wave vector $\\mathbf{q}^* = (0, \\frac{1}{4}+\\delta, \\frac{1}{2})$ in the 1T' phase of TaTe$_2$, which competes with fluctuating high-temperature Ta trimer bonding states at $\\mathbf{q}_\\mathrm{CO} =(0, \\frac{1}{3}, 0)$. The precursor state follows the temperature dependence of the hidden incommensurability of the $\\textit{quasi}$-1D nested Fermi surface. In contrast, the low-temperature commensurate charge order at $\\mathbf{q}_\\mathrm{CO}$, characterized by a charge disproportionation of the inequivalent Ta sites, appears to be driven by local chemical bonding. Dynamical lattice calculations identify an imaginary optical mode at $\\mathbf{q}^*$, involving an in-plane vibration of the Ta atoms forming a chain-like structure that renormalizes below $T_\\mathrm{CO}$. Our experimental and theoretical observations suggest that the controversial first-order phase transition, as captured by phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, results from the competition between two order parameters: one involving Fermi surface nesting and the other involving local chemical bonding."

In this work, we report observations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the electrical resistivity under magnetic fields up to 68 T applied parallel to the [001] crystallographic axis. Our measurements reveal an abrupt change in the oscillation frequencies near 14 T, which is indicative of a field-induced Lifshitz transition. Additionally, our results are consistent with the ferromagnetic order bringing the Weyl nodes closer to the Fermi level in CeAlSi. Furthermore, they suggest that the RKKY interaction plays an important role."

The relative intensities of electron and hole excitations encode the Bogoliubov coherence factors, revealing the momentum dependence of the pairing magnitude. Three $C_{3z}$-related tunneling channels enable direct detection of rotational symmetry breaking, as well as nodal points in the superconducting order parameter. We apply our framework to superconductivity within the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of noninteracting electrons and the Topological Heavy Fermion model, which accounts for electron-electron interactions. Together, these capabilities establish the QTM as a direct probe of the pairing symmetry and microscopic origin of superconductivity in two-dimensional materials."

The combination of charge repulsion and dipole attraction, along with different screening responses from an underlying electrolyte, lead to complex aggregations ranging from chain-like formation for linear polarizations to isotropic planar structures in the case of circular polarizations. In this work, we analyze the role of varying field anisotropies in these self-assembled structures. To this end, the formalism previously developed for the coarse-grained interactions of soft particles in the presence of linear [T.~Colla {\\it et al.}, ACS Nano {\\bf 12}, 4321-4337 (2018)] and circular [M.~Reich {\\it et al.}, Soft Matter {\\bf 21}, 1516-1528 (2025)] field polarizations is naturally extended to incorporate elliptical polarizations of arbitrary asymmetries. A rich variety of self-assembly formations is found at intermediate field anisotropies, thus bridging the gap between linear and circular field-induced self-assembly scenarios."

Among these materials, CrSBr has sparked interest due to its relatively high Curie temperature, highly anisotropic lattice structure, and high structural stability. These properties ran along others shared by any atomically thin material such as its outstanding defor- mation capacity and a strong optical response dominated by excitonic effects. The combination of these properties provides a fairly uncharted playground where to explore the interplay between magnetism and optical excitations. Here, we focus our attention on the theoretical optical response of CrSBr under several distinct strain configurations, analyzing the resulting changes to both the excitonic peaks and overall shape of the diagonal components of the linear conductivity tensor."

The method determines vertex corrections in the spin and charge channels self-consistently at the two-particle level, thereby avoiding the spurious finite-temperature phase transitions that limit dynamical mean-field theory in two dimensions. We derive the spectral self-energy and implement the framework directly on the real-frequency axis within the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, enabling the treatment of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states without relying on numerical analytic continuation. As an application, we demonstrate that a pseudogap can emerge in the bilayer Hubbard model when spin, charge, or excitonic fluctuations become sufficiently strong. Instabilities in different channels are also evaluated in an unbiased manner across the parameter space. Remarkably, we find that the excitonic susceptibility grows with increasing interlayer bias, before it gets suppressed at large biases by the charge imbalance between the layers. This work establishes a versatile and computationally efficient framework for investigating correlated multi-orbital systems under nonequilibrium conditions."

In these systems, a wealth of exotic phases appear that result from moir\\'e-dependent many-body electron correlation effects or non-trivial band topology. One problem with using twist to generate moir\\'e interference has been the difficulty in creating high-quality, uniform, and repeatable samples due to fabrication through mechanical stacking with viscoelastic stamps. Here we show, a new method to generate moir\\'e interference through the controlled application of layer-by-layer strain (heterostrain) on non-twisted 2D materials, where moir\\'e interference results from strain-induced lattice mismatch without twisting or stacking. Heterostrain generation is achieved by depositing stressed thin films onto 2D materials to apply large strains to the top layers while leaving layers further down less strained. We achieve deterministic control of moir\\'e periodicity and symmetry in non-twisted 2D multilayers and bilayers, with 97% yield, through varying stressor film force (film thickness X film stress) and geometry. Moir\\'e reconstruction effects are memorized after the removal of the stressor layers. Control over the strain degree-of-freedom opens the door to a completely unexplored set of unrealized tunable moir\\'e geometric symmetries, which may now be achieved in a high-yield and user-skill independent process taking only hours. This technique solves a long-standing throughput bottleneck in new moir\\'e quantum materials discovery and opens the door to industrially-compatible manufacturing for 2D moir\\'e-based electronic or optical devices."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70{\\deg}, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases."

By combining the GQD spectrum calculated from a time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) with the dynamical behavior of a QD model derived from QED, we calculate the main optical characteristics of the GQD, such as its transition frequencies, the dipole moment associated to each of those transitions, life-time and the population dynamics of the molecular levels.

      "summary": "Excitement about the magnetic and electronic properties of RuO$_2$ is growing, fueled by reports of antiferromagnetism, strain-induced superconductivity, and its recent classification as a member of a newly proposed magnetic class, altermagnets, with RuO$_2$ widely regarded as the paradigmatic example. Nevertheless, the magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ remains contentious, as several recent experiments report no evidence of magnetic order. To address this discrepancy, we performed resonant elastic scattering measurements on a series of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films grown on the (100)-plane of TiO$_2$ substrates across a range of strain states. Leveraging full polarization control and azimuthal scans of the structurally forbidden 100 Bragg reflection, we systematically tested for signatures of colinear antiferromagnetic order. We found that the resonant elastic scattering signal in RuO$_2$ thin films likely originates from anisotropic charge scattering, not long-range antiferromagnetic order. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we uncover a band structure without altermagnetic band splitting that is consistent with a nonmagnetic phase. Similarly, anisotropic magnetoresistance results show no evidence of magnetism. The combination of three independent measurements suggests the absence of altermagnetism in RuO$_2$."

This layer is expected to be non-magnetic, in contrast to MnSi and FeGe buffer layers that have been used previously, allowing an investigation of the intrinsic properties the MnGe in the ultrathin film limit without the influence of a neighboring magnetic layer. Single-phase MnGe(111) films were grown with thicknesses between 2 and 40 nm, which exhibited low interfacial roughnesses on the order of 0.6 nm. The films crystallized in a B20 structure with a small rhombohedral distortion. Magnetometry measurements in out-of-plane fields are consistent with a conical state. However, an unexpected remanent moment develops below 35 K, concomitant with features in the field dependence of the transport data. This provides indirect evidence for the presence of a low-temperature phase which has been identified by others as either a triple-Q topological spin-hedgehog lattice, or a multi-domain single-Q conical state."

We report scalable, biodegradable black phosphorus (BP) hybrids that provide mutation-resilient virucidal protection. BP sheets, produced via an optimized mechanochemical process, are covalently functionalized with 2-azido-4,6-dichloro- 1,3,5-triazine to form P=N bonds. Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide with intrinsic antiviral activity, and hydrophobic chains are then incorporated to achieve irreversible viral deactivation. The material exhibits strong antiviral inhibition and complete virucidal activity against multiple viruses, including recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. It maintains high biocompatibility, remains effective against viral mutations, and is shelf stable for at least five month. The combination of biodegradability, scalable synthesis, and synergistic antiviral and virucidal mechanisms establishes BP-conjugates as a new class of highly efficient antivirals. They offer a broad spectrum antiviral solutions that could bridge the gap between antiviral medicines and general antiseptics."

      "summary": "Symmetry plays a fundamental role in many-body systems, both in and out of equilibrium. The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) - a phenomenon where systems initially farther from equilibrium can thermalize faster - can be understood in terms of how rapidly a symmetry, broken by initial conditions, is dynamically restored. In this work, we study the QME in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XYZ model with power-law decaying interactions in the presence of a magnetic field. In the prethermal regime generated by large field strengths, the system develops a continuous U(1) symmetry, enabling the QME to emerge. However, due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the QME can only arise when interactions are sufficiently short-ranged. This leads to an interplay between the external field, interaction range, and dynamical symmetry restoration. We systematically explore this interplay and analyze the dependence of the QME on the effective temperature set by the initial state. Our results demonstrate the tunability of the QME via long-range interactions, which can be probed in experimental platforms of trapped ions, polar molecules, and NV centers."

Analyzing their modification under depolarizing noise, we propose a scalable fidelity estimator, validated on Google's 12-qubit Sycamore experiment and further supported by numerical simulations. We demonstrate its practicality for intermediate-scale quantum circuits, where cross-entropy benchmarking is costly and direct fidelity estimation is difficult."

      "summary": "Organic semiconductors are particularly attractive for polaritonics due to their large exciton binding energies and oscillator strengths. Among them, the ladder-type conjugated polymer poly(paraphenylene) (MeLPPP) is distinguished by its rigid backbone, narrow exciton linewidth, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and enhanced photostability, which makes it an excellent candidate for organic polariton devices. While polariton lasing has been reported in various organic systems, systematic studies of the transition from polariton lasing to conventional photon lasing within a single, well-controlled material platform remain limited. Understanding this crossover is crucial for distinguishing polariton-specific signatures from conventional lasing. Here, we present planar organic microcavities incorporating MeLPPP as the active medium that supports polariton lasing. By tuning the effective cavity length, we track the transition from strong to weak coupling and identify its impact on the lasing behaviour. Our results reveal a many fold increase in the lasing threshold when moving from polariton to photon lasing, emission energy pulling towards the polymer gain maximum for either regimes, and an important role of vibron mediated exciton relaxation evidenced by the reduction in lasing thresholds near vibron energy resonances with respect to the S10 exciton. These findings provide fundamental insight into light-matter coupling in organics and highlight MeLPPP microcavities as a versatile platform for future applications in low-threshold lasers."

The method operates in a two-stage loop of self-sampling and model refinement, progressively improving its ability to target low-energy structures.

      "summary": "Periodically driven (Floquet) systems typically evolve toward an infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption. Before reaching equilibrium, however, they can transiently exhibit long-lived prethermal states that host exotic nonequilibrium phenomena, such as discrete time crystals (DTCs). In this study, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of periodically driven product states in a kicked Ising model implemented on the IBM Quantum Eagle and Heron processors. By using ancilla qubits to mediate interactions, we construct Kagome and Lieb lattices on superconducting qubits with heavy-hex connectivity. We identify two distinct types of noise-induced DTCs on Kagome and Lieb lattices, both arising from quantum noise in ancilla qubits. Type-I DTCs originate from robust boundary-mode period-doubling oscillations, stabilized by symmetry charge pumping, that are redistributed into the bulk due to ancilla noise. Type-II DTCs, in contrast, emerge in systems without charge-pumped qubits, where quantum noise unexpectedly stabilizes period-doubling oscillations that would otherwise rapidly decay. On the noisier Eagle device (ibm_kyiv), we observe both type-I and type-II DTCs on 53-qubit Kagome lattices with and without charge-pumped qubits, respectively. In contrast, on the lower-noise Heron device (ibm_marrakesh), period-doubling oscillations are confined to boundary-localized oscillations on 82-qubit Kagome and 40-qubit Lieb lattices, as redistribution into the bulk is suppressed. These experimental findings are supported by noisy matrix-product-state simulations, in which ancilla noise is modeled as random sign flips in the two-qubit gate rotation angles. Our results demonstrate that quantum noise in ancilla qubits can give rise to novel classes of prethermal dynamical phases, including boundary-protected and noise-induced DTCs."

For this task, we combine the hybridization of surface plasmonic modes in complex nanostructures with the coupled electric dipole formalism employed for modelling the scattering of light by periodic arrays of small plasmonic nanoparticles. We propose treating coreshell nanoparticle as several coupled electric dipoles instead of just one and show how this is a more appropriate framework to study arrays of coreshell nanoparticles, which allows to build a one-to-one connection between the resonant modes of the nanoparticles and the dispersion bands of the system. Within this formalism, we show that a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain of coreshell Si@Ag nanoparticles host multiple topological edge states pinned at the resonant frequencies of the coreshell nanoparticles."

Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology has been used to develop a range of cryogenic electronic components for the control and readout of different qubit modalities interfaced on separate chips. However, recent measurements of quantum dots on this technology raise the tantalising prospect of realising control electronics and spin qubits on the same manufacturing platform, within a single integrated circuit (IC). Here, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout in addressable quantum dot devices within an IC fabricated using industry-standard 22 nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology. We achieve spin-to-charge conversion via a ramped energy-selective measurement, detected using a radio-frequency single-electron transistor and addressed by on-chip cryogenic electronics. The observation of consistent readout visibilities exceeding 90% and millisecond spin relaxation times in two nominally identical devices within the addressable array supports the reproducibility of the unit cell. The successful observation of spin readout using this CMOS process marks a key step towards realising highly scalable and integrated spin qubits."

In the past, deviations from symmetry in a periodic crystal were quantified by the number Z', which discretely counts geometrically non-equivalent formula units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations. We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetric form in physically meaningful Angstroms. Our experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction landscapes show that many simulated crystals can be filtered out as non-synthesisable not only due to high energy but also due to high values of the CIA, which is much faster to compute. On another hand, many crystals with high Z' values in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be almost symmetric due to low values of the CIA."

      "summary": "Information shared between parties quantifies their correlation. The encoding of correlations across space and time characterises the structure, history, and interactions of systems. One of the most fundamental properties that emerges from studies of information is the area law, which states that information shared between spatial subregions typically scales with the area of their boundary rather than their volume. In non-interacting, quantum many-body systems, where Gaussian statistics apply, the scaling of information measures is well understood. Within interacting systems, the readout of information measures is impeded by the complexity of state reconstruction. As such, no measurements beyond small quantum systems (e.g., composed of few, localised particles) have been made. Here, we fill this gap by experimentally demonstrating the area law of mutual information in an ultra-cold atom simulator of quantum fields with tuneable interaction strength. Our results detail the scaling of mutual information with subsystem volume, boundary area, and separation between spatial regions at finite temperature. Moreover, we quantify the total effect of non-Gaussian correlations using an information-theoretic measure - relative entropy. Our presented approach is data-driven, model agnostic, and readily applicable to other platforms and observables, thus constituting a universal toolkit for probing information in high-dimensional quantum systems and its role in shaping quantum matter and spacetime."

      "summary": "The competition between crystallization and vitrification in glass-forming materials manifests as a non-monotonic behavior in the time-temperature transformation (TTT) diagrams, which quantify the time scales for crystallization as a function of temperature. We develop a coarse-grained lattice model, the Arrow-Potts model, to explore the physics behind this competition. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the model showcases non-monotonic TTT diagrams resulting in polycrystalline structures, with two distinct regimes limited by either crystal nucleation or growth. At high temperatures, crystallization is limited by nucleation and results in the growth of compact crystal grains. At low temperatures, crystal growth is influenced by glassy dynamics, and proceeds through dynamically heterogeneous and hierarchical relaxation pathways producing fractal and ramified crystals. To explain these phenomena, we combine the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory with the field theory of nucleation, a random walk theory for crystal growth, and the dynamical facilitation theory for glassy dynamics. The unified theory yields an analytical formula relating crystallization timescale to the nucleation and growth rates through universal exponents governing glassy dynamics of the model. We show that the formula with the universal exponents yields excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation data and thus, it also accounts for the non-monotonic TTT diagrams produced by the model. Both the model and theory can be used to understand structural ordering in various glassy systems including bulk metallic glass alloys, organic molecules, and colloidal suspensions."

In contrast to optically driven HHG--where the harmonic cutoff scales as $\\omega^{-3}$ with the driving frequency $\\omega$--our time-dependent quantum transport simulations reveal a qualitatively distinct scaling law for magnetically driven HHG in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction: the harmonic cutoff $n_{\\mathrm{max}}$ scales as $\\omega^{-1}$. This fundamental difference arises from distinct excitation mechanisms--namely, spin-flip transitions driven by vectorial magnetic precession, as opposed to scalar electric fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the precession cone angle $\\theta$ serves as a crucial control parameter. Increasing $\\theta$ broadens the harmonic bandwidth, with peak emission achieved for nearly in-plane magnetic dynamics. Our findings establish magnetically driven HHG as a robust and tunable mechanism for nonlinear spin transport, governed by unique scaling laws with potential applications in ultrafast spintronic technologies."

To shed light on how the stationary state of such systems is affected by breaking reciprocity, we consider active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles coupled nonreciprocally by a transverse force, which is perpendicular to the gradient of the interaction energy. Focusing on the steady-state distribution of positions, we show that the nonreciprocal coupling helps keep the system at its stable configurations, including not only energy minima but also nonequilibrium configurations stabilized by the persistent noise which propels the particles. In contrast, the transverse force would not change the stationary distribution at all if the noise were thermal. For a variety of active systems, we demonstrate the stabilizing role of the nonreciprocity, finding that it stiffens springs, aligns spins, improves associative memory, and enhances motility-induced phase separation."

Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. The SQGT is directly related to observable properties of BBdG systems. We show how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov-Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model."

Here, we investigate the terahertz (THz) field-induced dynamics of Raman-active phonons in LaAlO$_3$ (LAO), an archetypal quantum material for its electronic and structural properties. Utilizing intense THz pulses, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of parametric phonon excitation marked by substantial subharmonic components. Theoretical analysis can successfully capture the hallmarks of the observed phenomena in a physical scenario with the THz field inducing a parametric coupling between the Raman mode and pairs of acoustic phonon excitations."

Here we access this paradigm, by confining dipolar excitons in a nanoscopic lattice where long-range hopping, and nearest-neighbour dipolar repulsions, dress the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Long-range hopping is evidenced by the spontaneous buildup of many-body sub-radiance, signalled by an algebraic slowdown of excitons radiative dissipation. In addition, we observe a threshold increase of temporal coherence for dipolar quantum solids only. It suggests that excitons condense in a single sub-radiant state for Mott-like phases. These combine then spatial order and collectively extended coherence, in a single degree of freedom. Our study unveils that nanoscopic exciton arrays provide a unique platform to design new frontiers of strongly-correlated lattice models with long-range correlations."

Monolayer CrPS$_{4}$ can display a sizable linear anomalous Hall effect, while its nonlinear anomalous Hall response is forbidden. In contrast, bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ can produce pronounced intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall response from Berry-connection polarizability, in the absence of linear anomalous Hall effect. We clarify that the large peaks in these responses originate from gapped Dirac points in the band structure. Furthermore, we show that linear anomalous Hall effect can be induced and controlled in bilayer CrPS$_{4}$ by gate electric field or in-plane magnetic field, which break the spacetime inversion symmetry. Our findings unveil the interesting layer-dependent Hall transport physics in 2D CrPS$_{4}$ magnets, suggesting its potential in electronic and spintronic device applications."

The coefficients in the low-temperature series of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit are represented using the explicit expression of the density function of the Fisher zeros. The asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of the coefficients when the order goes to infinity is determined exactly, for both the series of the free energy and of the partition function. Our analytic and numerical results demonstrate that, the convergence radius of the sequence is dependent on the accumulation points of the Fisher zeros which have the smallest modulus. In the zero field case this accumulation point is the physical critical point, while in the imaginary field case it corresponds to a non-physical singularity. We further discuss the relation between the series coefficients and the energy state degeneracies, using the combinatorial expression of the coefficients and the subgraph expansion."

Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord.

The interactions between magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for magnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging. Here we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph coupling matrices and compute them in 2D ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated graphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and mag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling can exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon modes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the inelastic magnon relaxation time is found to decrease abruptly above the threshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, thereby defining a low-energy window for efficient magnon transport. By averaging in this window, we compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean-free path, a key figure of merit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and computational tools shown in this work enable studies of magnon interactions, scattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic systems and magnon- and spin-based devices."

We focus on the case where two components are strongly coupled by the drive, forming hybrid superpositions, and interacting with an uncoupled third component. Using a generalized Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) ansatz, we show that there are two coupled superfluid order parameters, and we obtain the associated free energy and quasiparticle excitation spectrum. We find that we can drive BCS-BCS, BCS-Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and BEC-BEC crossovers purely by varying the detuning of the Rabi drive from the bare transition, with the precise crossover depending on the sign of the underlying interactions between the coupled and uncoupled components. We furthermore identify an exotic excited branch which features both normal to BCS superfluid transitions, as well as a BCS-BEC-BCS crossover. Introducing a generalized Thouless criterion, we show that this behavior is reflected in the critical temperature for superfluidity. Our Rabi-coupled scenario also gives possesses additional thermodynamic properties related to the pseudospin of the coupled components, which provide novel signatures of the state of the many-body system. The Rabi-driven Fermi gas thus emerges as a unique platform for engineering and probing a rich array of multi-band superfluid phases."

      "summary": "We consider Hopfield networks, where neurons interact pair-wise by Hebbian couplings built over $i$. a set of definite patterns (ground truths), $ii$. a sample of labeled examples (supervised setting), $iii$. a sample of unlabeled examples (unsupervised setting). We focus on the case where ground-truths are Rademacher vectors and examples are noisy versions of these ground-truths, possibly displaying some blank entries (e.g., mimicking missing or dropped data), and we determine the spectral distribution of the coupling matrices in the three scenarios, by exploiting and extending the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. By levering this knowledge, we are able to analytically inspect the stability and attractiveness of the ground truths, as well as the generalization capabilities of the networks. In particular, as corroborated by long-running Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of black entries can have benefits in some specific conditions, suggesting strategies based on data sparsification; the robustness of these results in structured datasets is confirmed numerically. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbian matrix, built on sparse examples, can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function."

      "summary": "Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced $\\lambda$-jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the $\\lambda$-jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become `soft' under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked `kineo-elastic' term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations."

This framework gives rise to a rich phase structure characterized by complex-energy braiding and tunable non-Hermitian skin effects. By employing the generalized Brillouin zone approach, we analyze the bulk-boundary correspondence and identify topological transitions protected by chiral symmetry. Notably, we demonstrate that non-Abelian gauge fields significantly enhance the dynamical resilience of the system, enabling robust self-healing under a moving scattering potential. These results clarify the role of SU(2) gauge fields in stabilizing non-Hermitian topological phases and indicate that the proposed model can be realized with currently available photonic, atomic, and superconducting experimental platforms."

When ABPs are sufficiently persistent, they undergo a liquid-gas phase separation and, in the presence of obstacles, accumulate around them, forming a wetting layer. Here, we perform simulations of ABPs in a quasi-one-dimensional domain in the presence of a wall, studying the dynamics of the polarization field. On the course of time, we observe a transition from a homogeneous (where all particles are aligned) to a heterogeneous (where particles align only at the interface) polarization regime.

Free-space terahertz magneto-optics can directly probe the gap to charge excitations which bounds the stability of electronic states, but this measurement has thus-far been inaccessible due to the micron size of twisted bilayer graphene samples, while the wavelength of terahertz light is up to a millimeter. Here we leverage advances in fabrication to create twisted bilayer graphene samples over 5 mm x 5 mm in size with a uniform twist angle and study the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron resonance by a complex Faraday rotation experiment in p-doped large angle twisted bilayer graphene. These measurements directly probe charge excitations in inter-Landau level transitions and determine the Fermi velocity as a function of twist angle."

The material is found to be an antiferromagnetic semiconductor with the lowest direct gap of 2.44 eV at the $\\Gamma$ point and an indirect gap of 1.87 eV. The material is an altermagnet, with the two magnetic atoms of opposite spin related by a two-fold rotation operation perpendicular to the main 4-fold rotation inversion axis. The spin splittings along a low symmetry line like $PN$ are sizable, while at k-points on the diagonal mirror planes or on the twofold symmetry axes, the spin splitting is zero. The exchange interactions are calculated using a linear response approach. The antiferromagnetic exchange-interaction between nearest neighbors in the primitive unit cell is dominating and found to be slightly decreasing upon carrier doping. The transverse spin susceptibilities, which provide interatomic site exchange interactions after averaging over the muffin-tin spheres, are calculated from the $GW$ band structure and wave functions. From these exchange interactions, the spin wave spectra are obtained along the high symmetry lines and the N\\'{e}el temperature is calculated using the mean-field and Tyablikov (RPA) estimations. The dielectric function and the optical absorption spectra are calculated, including excitonic effects, using the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The exchange interactions around Mn$_{\\rm Ge}$ defect sites are also studied. While we find it can generate ferromagnetic interactions with neighboring spins, we did not find evidence of producing an overall ferromagnetic phase. If Mn antisites are introduced by exchanging Mn with a nearby Ge, the interactions stay largely antiferromagnetic. Adding Mn antisites leads to a metallic band structure."

In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions."

We study the tunneling conductance of $p$-wave unconventional magnet/superconductor junctions by adopting the effective Hamiltonian of $p$-wave unconventional magnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking, suggested in Ref [arXiv: 2309.01607 (2024)]. The tunneling conductance shows an asymmetric behavior with respect to bias voltage in the helical $p$-wave superconductor junctions. It is caused by the missing of helical edge states contributing to the charge conductance owing to the momentum-dependent spin-split feature of the Fermi surface in $p$-wave unconventional magnets. In chiral $d$ and $p$-wave superconductor junctions, the resulting spin-resolved tunneling conductance takes a different value for spin sectors due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors. Our results qualitatively reproduce the results based on the simplified Hamiltonian in Ref [J.\\ Phys.\\ Soc.\\ Jpn.\\ \\textbf{93}, 114703 (2024)], where only the odd function of the exchange coupling of $p$-wave unconventional magnets is taken into account, which gives the shift of the Fermi surface and preserves the time-reversal symmetry similar to the spin-orbit coupling."

The chirality arises from the breaking of Galilean invariance by spin-orbit coupling, which enables the system to dynamically adjust its condensation momentum and spin polarization in response to its velocity. As a result, only towards a specific moving direction and beyond a critical velocity, the acquired spin polarization can trigger collective interactions sufficient for self-binding and drive a first-order transition from gas to droplet. We have mapped out a phase diagram of droplet, gas and their coexistence for realistic spin-orbit coupled 39K mixtures with tunable moving velocity and magnetic detuning. Our results have revealed the emergence of chirality in spin-orbit coupled quantum gases, which shed light on general chiral phenomena in moving systems with broken Galilean invariance."

Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis predicts a superconducting transition temperature \\( T_c \\approx 14\\ \\mathrm{K} \\) at ambient pressure, which is the highest value reported so far among cubic semimetallic superconductors. When subjected to a pressure of 15 GPa, \\( T_c \\) increases further to 18 K. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation."

Our analysis reveals an intriguing contrast between the two systems. We find that the generic minimal model exhibits the expected non-zero magnetic-octupole order. In the monolayer-FeSe model, however, the magnetic-octupole order vanishes globally, and a magnetic-hexadecapole order is present instead. The emergence of altermagnetic splitting in the band structure then arises via the interplay with a sublattice-isospin degree of freedom. Our work demonstrates how the classification and comprehensive understanding of 2D altermagnetic materials transcends bulk descriptions."

Given the success of numerical bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects. We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous evidence that the $\\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to domain wall proliferation."

      "summary": "The ability to control and manipulate time-reversal ($T$) symmetry-breaking phases with near-zero net magnetization is a sought-after goal in spintronic devices. The recently discovered hexagonal altermagnet manganese telluride ($\\alpha$-MnTe) is a prime example. It has a compensated altermagnetic ground state where the magnetic moments are aligned in each layer and stacked antiparallel along the $c$ axis, yet it exhibits a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that breaks the $T$-symmetry with a vanishingly small $c$-axis ferromagnetic (FM) moment. However, the presence of three 120$^\\circ$ separated in-plane magnetic domains presents a challenge in understanding the origin of the AHE and the effective control of the altermagnetic state. Here we use neutron scattering to show that a compressive uniaxial strain along the next-nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn bond direction detwins $\\alpha$-MnTe into a single in-plane magnetic domain, aligning the in-plane moments along the same axis. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial strain (-0.2% to 0.1%) significantly sharpens the magnetic hysteresis loop and switches the sign of the AHE near room temperature. Remarkably, this is achieved without altering the altermagnetic phase-transition temperature or substantially changing the small $c$-axis FM moment. Combined with our phenomenological model, we argue that these effects result from the modification of the electronic Berry curvature by a combination of both spin-orbit coupling and strain. Our work not only unambiguously establishes the relationship between the in-plane moment direction and the AHE in $\\alpha$-MnTe but also paves the way for future applications in highly scalable, strain-tunable magnetic sensors and spintronic devices."

The most efficient approximation for the matrix element calculations is the two-center approximation (2CA) in tight binding (TB). In the 2CA, a variety of matrix elements are neglected with only \"two-center integrals\" (2CI) remaining. The 2CI are calculated efficiently by rotating to symmetrical coordinates where the integral is parameterized. This makes TB fast in exchange for diminished transferability. An ideal electronic structure method has both the efficiency of TB and the transferability of ab-initio methods. In this work, I expand the full crystal potential into multipoles where the resulting matrix elements are transformed into the form of 2CI between high angular momentum functions. The usual Slater-Koster formulae for TB are limited to $l\\leq3$; to enable efficient evaluation of the full crystal potential 2CI, I derive a Wigner matrix based convolution algorithm (WMCA) that works for arbitrary angular momentum. Given a suitable method for generating a local ab-initio Kohn-Sham potential, the algorithm for calculating matrix elements is applicable to fully ab-initio LCAO methods (this is the subject of forthcoming work). In this paper, I apply the WMCA to silicon using a model crystal potential."

To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a narrow region of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying."

Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation."

      "summary": "The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics."

      "summary": "Quantum heat transport by electrons in ballistic channels is usually well-described in the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker framework, which fails when introducing strong Coulomb interactions. We theoretically show that a chain of small metallic dots where charge cannot accumulate, connected by ballistic channels, conducts heat better than charge. We relate this feature to the competition between heat diffusion by neutral excitations and Coulomb interactions in the chain, which defines a temperature gradient over a finite characteristic length. We show that the Lorenz ratio can be arbitrarily large, scaling as the square root of the chain's length, which suggests new approaches for heat manipulation in mesoscopic systems."

      "summary": "High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids provides a powerful platform to probe ultrafast electron dynamics and interband--intraband coupling. However, disentangling the complex many-body contributions in the HHG spectrum remains challenging. Here we introduce a machine-learning approach based on a Transformer encoder to analyze and reconstruct HHG signals computed from a one-dimensional Kronig--Penney model. The self-attention mechanism inherently highlights correlations between temporal dipole dynamics and high-frequency spectral components, allowing us to identify signatures of nonadiabatic band coupling that are otherwise obscured in standard Fourier analysis. By combining attention maps with Gabor time--frequency analysis, we extract and amplify weak coupling channels that contribute to even-order harmonics and anomalous spectral features. Our results demonstrate that multi-head self-attention acts as a selective filter for strong-coupling events in the time domain, enabling a physics-informed interpretation of high-dimensional quantum dynamics. This work establishes Transformer-based attention as a versatile tool for solid-state strong-field physics, opening new possibilities for interpretable machine learning in attosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear photonics."

These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switche the N\\'eel vector.

However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The fields of entanglement theory and tensor networks have recently emerged as central tools for characterising quantum phases of matter. In this article, we determine the entanglement structure of ground states of gapped symmetric quantum lattice models, and use this to obtain the most efficient tensor network representation of those ground states. We do this by showing that degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum arise through a duality transformation of the original model to the unique dual model where the entire dual (generalised) symmetry is spontaneously broken and subsequently no degeneracies are present. Physically, this duality transformation amounts to a (twisted) gauging of the unbroken symmetry in the original ground state. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that completely breaks the symmetry minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional tensor network methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the practical simulation of strongly correlated systems."

The rollout of 5G and the upcoming 6G networks intensifies the demand for devices that can operate at higher frequencies while remaining scalable, compact, and energy-efficient - requirements that spin waves are well suited to meet. The first two sections revisit the fundamentals of magnonics, trace major milestones in spin-wave research, and summarize recent advances in materials and device design. The third section reviews RF applications studied over the past 50 years, with emphasis on key passive components, such as filters, limiters, delay lines, phase shifters, and directional couplers. The final section discusses both the advantages and the open challenges of spin-wave devices, including insertion losses, linearity, and power handling, together with the strategies to address them. By linking fundamental insights with technological needs, this review outlines a path toward practical RF platforms. Spin-wave-based devices, with their scalability, versatility, and potential for low-power operation, hold strong promise for future wireless communication, particularly in the 5G and 6G era."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) machine learning method is increasingly used to guide experimental optimization tasks in materials science. To emulate the large number of input variables and noise-containing results in experimental materials research, we perform batch BO simulation of six design variables with a range of noise levels. Two test cases relevant for materials science problems are examined: a needle-in-a-haystack case (Ackley function) that may be encountered in, e.g., molecule optimizations, and a smooth landscape with a local optimum in addition to the global optimum (Hartmann function) that may be encountered in, e.g., material composition optimization. We show learning curves, performance metrics, and visualization to effectively track the optimization progression and evaluate how the optimization outcomes are affected by noise, batch-picking method, choice of acquisition function, and exploration hyperparameter values. We find that the effects of noise depend on the problem landscape: noise degrades the optimization results of a needle-in-a-haystack search (Ackley) dramatically more. However, with increasing noise, we observe an increasing probability of landing on the local optimum in Hartmann. Therefore, prior knowledge of the problem domain structure and noise level is essential when designing BO for materials research experiments. Synthetic data studies -- with known ground truth and controlled noise levels -- enable us to isolate and evaluate the impact of different batch BO components, {\\it e.g.}, acquisition policy, objective metrics, and hyperparameter values, before transitioning to the inherent uncertainties of real experimental systems. The results and methodology of this study will facilitate a greater utilization of BO in guiding experimental materials research, specifically in settings with a large number of design variables to optimize."

Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show that the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool, which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology and inspiring a new generation of devices with it."

This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks."

While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations-such as the Toffoli gate-remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in direct decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. We have also applied the JK algorithm to other multi-qubit gates and algorithm. For the Fredkin gate, it reduces the number of time steps from 200 to 104 and the number of exchange unitaries from 276 to 172. For the quantum Fourier transform, it compresses the sequence from 180 to 80 time steps and from 237 to 202 exchange unitaries. These results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms."

We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have a much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy.

This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback.

Here the authors utilise DC progenitors, constitutively expressing IL-12 and an engineered extracellular vesicle-internalizing receptor (EVIR), which give rise to mature conventional type 1 DCs with improved antigen presenting capacities, resulting in improved anti-tumour immunity in a mouse model of melanoma."

The authors propose here that the uncontrolled native doping may underlie the long-standing experimental discrepancies on the symmetry of the CDW. By constructing low-energy models for TiSe 2 coupled to the conventional order parameter, they show that doping generically drives transitions from threefold symmetric to nematic and stripe CDW phases.

Improving the ability to isolate vibration, however, comes at the cost of the ability to support an external load. The architecture described here shows promise for integrating topological mechanical metamaterials into engineered solutions to vibration isolation and impact mitigation. [Phys. Rev.

Unlike in other technologies, though, here the long-term stability of multiple consecutive synaptic states is rare. To address this issue, the authors exploit the high thermal stability of magnetization in a heavy-metal/ferromagnetic-metal stack with graded thickness of the heavy metal. In micrometer-scale devices made from the stack, they demonstrate the stability of approximately 30 synaptic states for up to 1200 seconds, with some states stable for up to 50,000 seconds. These results pave the way for spintronic neuromorphic computing technologies. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 044038] Published Tue Oct 14, 2025"
