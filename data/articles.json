While the scattering rate is only moderately anisotropic at zero strain, we find that it becomes strongly anisotropic at the Lifshitz point. At the lowest energies, we recover the expected universal behavior: the scattering rate varies (ignoring logarithmic corrections) as $\\tau^{-1}\\sim \\omega $ at the Van Hove point and as $\\tau^{-1}\\sim \\omega^{3/2}$ away from it. At higher energies, however, corrections of order $\\omega^2$ become important in both regimes. We show that the experimentally observed behavior $\\tau^{-1} \\sim \\omega^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\approx 1.4(2)$ at the Van Hove point can be quantitatively explained by a superposition of linear and quadratic contributions to the scattering rate, which are comparable in magnitude at the intermediate energies probed by experiment, rather than in terms of a new universal power law. We further predict a distinctive anisotropy, strain dependence, and a non-monotonic frequency dependence of the scattering rate at a Lifshitz transition, all of which may be directly tested in experiments."

      "summary": "A superfluid flows without friction below a critical velocity, exhibiting zero drag force on impurities. Above this threshold, superfluidity breaks down, and the internal energy is redistributed into incoherent excitations such as vortices. We demonstrate that a finite-mass, mobile impurity immersed in a flowing two-dimensional paraxial superfluid of light can \\textit{swim} against the superfluid current when this critical velocity is exceeded. This self-propulsion is achieved by the periodic emission of quantized vortex-antivortex pairs downstream, which impart an upstream recoil momentum that results in a net propulsive force. Analogous to biological systems that minimize effort by exploiting wake turbulence, the impurity harnesses this vortex backreaction as a passive mechanism of locomotion. Reducing the impurity dynamics to the motion of its center of mass and using a point-vortex model, we quantitatively describe how this mechanism depends on the impurity geometry and the surrounding flow velocity. Our findings establish a fundamental link between internal-energy dissipation in quantum fluids and concepts of self-propulsion in active-matter systems, and opens new possibilities for exploiting vortices for controlled quantum transport at the microscale."

      "summary": "Recent studies of delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains have highlighted the role of rare, chain-breaking events that favor localization, in particular for high-energy eigenstates related to many-body localization. In this context, we revisit the random-field XXZ spin-1/2 chain at zero temperature with ferromagnetic interactions, equivalent to interacting fermions or hard-core bosons in a random potential with attractive interactions. We argue that localization in this model can be characterized by chain-breaking events, which are probed by the extreme values of simple local observables, such as the on-site density or the local magnetization, that are readily accessible in both experiments and numerical simulations. Adopting a bosonic language, we study the disorder-induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition from superfluid (SF) to Bose glass (BG), and focus on the strong disorder regime where localization is driven by weak links. Based on high-precision density matrix renormalization group simulations, we numerically show that extreme local densities accurately capture the BKT transition, even for relatively short chains ranging from a few dozen to a hundred sites. We also discuss the SF-BG transition in the weak disorder regime, where finite-size effects pose greater challenges. Overall, our work seeks to establish a solid foundation for using extreme statistics of local observables, such as density, to probe delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains, both in the ground state and at high energy."

Our analysis focuses on the leaky quantum standard map (QSM) of the kicked rotor. We compare its complex resonance spectrum with both Ginibre and truncated circular orthogonal ensembles (TCOEs). We find that the long-lived resonances follow TCOE statistics, reproducing the density of states and level spacing correlations, but depart from Ginibre predictions. Short-lived resonances, however, do not show a clear correspondence with either random-matrix ensemble. We also demonstrate that increasing the leak size takes the density of states of the TCOE toward the Ginibre limit, yet their spectral correlations remain distinct."

Starting from the symmetry-allowed $JK\\Gamma$ Hamiltonian with Heisenberg $J$, Kitaev $K$, and off-diagonal $\\Gamma$ interactions, we show that the $\\Gamma$ interaction naturally generates the four-sublattice pattern associated with the crystal's screw symmetry. Using the density matrix renormalization group, we identify two distinct field-induced transitions. The first is a continuous transition into an intermediate phase, where the symmetry responsible for the two-fold ground-state degeneracy is broken. The second is a first-order transition into the high-field phase, characterized by a discontinuous jump in the spin-spin correlator. Entanglement-entropy scaling confirms that the first transition belongs to the Ising critical point with the central charge $1/2$. These results establish a microscopic framework for pseudospin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ screw-chain systems such as Co$^{2+}$ materials, uncover an intermediate phase whose width increases with $\\Gamma$, and provide guidance for systematic exploration of additional field orientations and structural distortions."

      "summary": "Quantum point contacts (QPC) are a key instrument in investigating the physics of edge excitations in the quantum Hall effect. However, at not-so-high bias voltage values, the predictions of the conventional point QPC model often deviate from the experimental data both in the integer and (more prominently) in the fractional quantum Hall regime. One of the possible explanations for such behaviors is the dependence of the tunneling between the edges on energy, an effect not present in the conventional model. Here we introduce two models that take QPC spatial extension into account: wide-QPC model that accounts for the distance along which the edges are in contact; long-QPC model accounts for the fact that the tunneling amplitude originates from a finite bulk gap and a finite distance between the two edges. We investigate the predictions of these two models in the integer quantum Hall regime for the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude. We find that these two models predict opposite dependences: the amplitude decreasing or increasing away from the Fermi level. We thus elucidate the effect of the QPC geometry on the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude and investigate its implications for transport observables."

Here, we identify a second building block for quantum geometry: a band-resolved adiabatic connection operator that captures the noncommutativity between band projectors and their momentum derivatives. The band-resolved adiabatic connection operator, first introduced in the theory of adiabatic driving, serves as a generalized angular momentum within the state manifold of single bands, and we employ it to reformulate expressions for the band-resolved orbital magnetic moment. This form provides a complementary geometric interpretation alongside the multiband separation between energetic- and quantum-state properties by the two-state Berry curvature. Our formalism allows us to present formulas valid for both nondegenerate and degenerate bands, thereby removing the limitations of the common Bloch-state formula. We illustrate our theory by calculating a large orbital magnetization emerging without spin-orbit coupling in a spin-compensated, noncoplanar anomalous Hall magnet with degenerate bands."

All the polymorphs are found to be mechanically stable. The polymorphs are elastically anisotropic, machinable and have high hardness and toughness. The cubic phase possesses brittle nature while the other phases show ductile character. The high melting point of the polymorphs reveals that they can be used in tough situations. Also, three of the polymorphs can be used as thermal barrier coating. Moreover, we have also calculated the lattice dynamics and found improved results compared to the available results in the literature. In addition, the temperature and pressure dependent thermodynamic parameters of the polymorphs are evaluated and analyzed for the first time using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. The thermodynamic properties suggested that all phases would be good choices for application in the fields of automobiles, cooling systems, thermal electronic devices, thermal exchangers, and space crafts."

By electrostatically gating the ferromagnetic layers to modulate their chemical potentials, the system can be continuously tuned between the standard, inverse and triplet (non-monotonic) SVE regimes within the same device. This tunability originates from the gate-controlled hybridization between the superconducting and ferromagnetic electronic spectra, which determines the effective exchange field induced in the S-layer. Furthermore, we reveal that gating enables exotic, non-BCS temperature dependencies of the superconducting order parameter, including reentrant superconductivity, bistable states, first-order phase transitions, and the emergence of superconductivity at finite temperatures. Our results establish vdW F/S/F trilayers as a versatile and highly controllable platform for superconducting spintronics, where external gate voltages can selectively activate different spin-valve functionalities and unconventional superconducting states."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions occur ubiquitously in condensed matter systems from topological phases to quantum critical points. Since the advent of topological semimetals, where the dispersion is often tilted around the band crossing where the Dirac fermion can appear, tilt has emerged as a key handle that controls physical properties. We study how tilt affects the transport and spectral properties of tilted 2D Dirac fermions under scalar disorder. Although our spectral analyses always show conformity to appropriate Gaussian ensembles, suggestive of delocalization, the conductivity scaling $g(L)$ shows a surprising richness. For a single Dirac node, relevant for quantum Hall transitions and topological insulator surface states, we find $g(L)\\sim a_1\\log(L)$ with a tilt-dependent coefficient $a_1>0$. Interestingly, when the tilt and transport directions are aligned, $a_1$ and hence $g(L)$ shows a spike at the critical point between the type-I and type-II regimes of the Dirac node. For systems with two Dirac nodes with unbroken time-reversal symmetry, pertinent to quasi-2D Dirac materials, we find $g(L)\\sim L^{a_1}(\\log L)^{a_2}$. However, we find a surprising tension between tilt along and perpendicular to the transport directions. For the former, $a_1$ changes sign as a function of tilt, hinting at a tilt-driven localization-delocalization transition, while $a_1<0$ for all tilts in the latter case, implying localization. These localized behaviors also reveal tension with the delocalization seen in spectral properties and suggest differing localization tendencies in real and Hilbert spaces. Overall, our work identifies tilt as an essential control parameter that uncovers rich and unconventional transport physics in 2D Dirac materials."

      "summary": "The energy levels and optical transitions of tetrahedral core/shell InP/ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) are investigated by means of multi-band k$\\cdot$p theory. Despite the $\\overline{T}_d$ symmetry relaxing spherical selection rules, the near-band-edge excitonic spectrum is reminiscent of that obtained for spherical nanocrystals. Exceptions appear in large (red-emitting) QDs, where transitions violating the (quasi-)angular momentum selection rule ($\\Delta L=0,\\pm 2$) are observed, and the ground state does not become dark ($P_{3/2}$-like). Valence band coupling is important in determining the symmetry, degeneracy and energy of hole states, with split-off holes playing a greater role than in CdSe QDs. The ($1S_e$-like) electron ground state exhibits moderate delocalization into the ZnSe shell. The confinement regime is then strong even for thick shells, which results in Coulomb interactions being mostly perturbative. Electrons remain largely localized in the InP core even in negative trions, despite electron-electron repulsions. At the same time, the asymmetry between Coulomb attractions and repulsions leads to negative (positive) trions being bound (antibound) by tens of meV. The biexciton binding energy switches from positive to negative, depending on the QD size."

By combining the Matra-Genoa generative model, Orb-v2 universal machine learning interatomic potential, and ALIGNN graph neural network for energy prediction, we generated 119 million candidate structures and added 1.3 million DFT-validated compounds to the ALEXANDRIA database, including 74 thousand new stable materials. The expanded ALEXANDRIA database now contains 5.8 million structures with 175 thousand compounds on the convex hull. Predicted structural disorder rates (37-43%) match experimental databases, unlike other recent AI-generated datasets. Analysis reveals fundamental patterns in space group distributions, coordination environments, and phase stability networks, including sub-linear scaling of convex hull connectivity. We release the complete dataset, including sAlex25 with 14 million out-of-equilibrium structures containing forces and stresses for training universal force fields. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a GRACE model on this data improves benchmark accuracy. All data, models, and workflows are freely available under Creative Commons licenses."

We compare properties including single-photon purity (g2(t)), linewidth, blinking, and photostability. We find that at room temperature, these silane-coated dots perform comparably to the PEAC8C12 passivation in terms of single-photon performance metrics, while exhibiting improvements in photostability. However, we find that at 4K, silane-coated FAPbBr3 quantum dots perform worse than the PEAC8C12-passivated samples, exhibiting faster blue-shifting and photobleaching under illumination. Analysis of fluorescence lifetime intensity distributions from the photon-counting data indicates increased efficiency of fast non-radiative processes in the silane-coated quantum dots at 4K. We propose a trion related degradation pathway at low temperatures that is consistent with the observed kinetics and estimate that at 4K with 6.1 uJ/cm2, 472 nm excitation the silane-coated quantum dots build up double the trion population of their PEAC8C12-passivated counterparts."

Recent advancements have unveiled a rich tapestry of 3D topological magnetism. Nevertheless, the practical application of 3D topological magnetism in the development of topological spintronic devices remains a challenge. Here, we showcase the experimental utilization of 3D topological magnetism through the exploitation of skyrmion-edge attractive interactions in 90-nm-wide confined chiral FeGe and CoZnMn magnetic nanostructures. These attractive interactions result in two degenerate equilibrium positions, which can be naturally interpreted as binary bits for a skyrmion sliding switch. Our theory and simulation reveal current-driven spiral motions of skyrmions, governed by the anisotropic gradient of the potential landscape. Our experiments validate the theory that predicts a tunable threshold current density via magnetic field and temperature modulation of the energy barrier. Our results offer an approach for implementing universal on-off switch functions in 3D topological spintronic devices."

For fundamental device applications, the ability to electrically manipulate individual solitons is crucial. However, electrical manipulation of single antiskyrmions has been rarely demonstrated. In this work, we present current-controlled manipulations, encompassing the creation, deletion, and topological transformation of a single antiskyrmion within FeNiPdP nanostructured cells at room temperature. This nanostructure is uniquely designed with dimensions of about 400 nm in width and length, enabling the stabilization of a single antiskyrmion. By simply adjusting the density of nanosecond single-pulsed currents, we achieve the reversible creation and deletion of single antiskyrmions. Moreover, we uncover a rich variety of current-controlled topological transformations among individual antiskyrmions, skyrmions, bubbles, and ferromagnetic states. Our experimental findings are corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, highlighting the pivotal role of current-induced combined effects, such as spin transfer torque and Joule heating. Our results hold potential for advancing antiskyrmion-based device applications."

The current-induced creation of skyrmions is well-understood through the spin-transfer torque acting on surface spin twists of the spontaneous 3D ferromagnetic state, caused by the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction of the uniaxial Fe3Sn2 magnet with a low-quality factor. Current-induced deletions of skyrmions result from the combined effects of magnetic hysteresis and Joule thermal heating. Our results are replicated consistently through 3D micromagnetic simulations. Our approach offers a viable method for achieving reliable single-bit operations in skyrmionic devices for applications such as random-access memories."

However, these films typically have high damping, making spin wave propagation distances short (less than one micrometer). In this work, we theoretically study a thin ferromagnetic strip with iDMI and excite spin waves by driving a central segment of the strip. Spin waves propagate with different amplitudes to the left versus to the right from the driving region (i.e. nonreciprocity occurs) due to the iDMI. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion plus our micromagnetic simulations both show that changing the driving segment width, driving frequency and static applied field strength tunes the nonreciprocity. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion, using a so-called \"overlap function\" will allow researchers to predict conditions of maximum nonreciprocity, without the need for computational solvers. Moreover, to circumvent the issue of short propagation distances, we propose a geometry where iDMI is only present in the driving region and low-damping materials comprise the remainder of the strip. Our calculations show significant spin wave amplitudes over several microns from the excitation region."

Here, we develop a fully automated three-dimensional piezoresponse force microscopy (Auto-3DPFM) technique automating all essential steps in interferometric PFM for 3D polarization vector characterization, including laser alignment, tip calibration and approach, image acquisition, polarization vector reconstruction, and visualization. The automation reduces the experimental burden of ferroelectric polarization vector characterization, while the back-and-forth calibration ensures consistency and reproducibility of 3D polarization reconstruction. An algorithmic workflow is also developed to identify domain walls and calculate their characteristic angles via a spatial vector-angle-difference method, presenting one unique capability enabled by Auto-3DPFM that is not accessible with traditional PFM techniques. Beyond representing a significant step forward in 3D polarization mapping, Auto-3DPFM promises to accelerate discovery via high-throughput and autonomous characterization in ferroelectric materials research. When integrated with machine learning and adaptive sampling strategies in self-driving labs, Auto-3DPFM will serve as a valuable tool for advancing ferroelectric physics and microelectronics development."

Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we show how the liquid-gas phase transition occurs in this system, and elucidate the finite-temperature phase structure consisting of the gas phase, liquid phase, their coexistence, and the spinodal phase. We also discuss its similarity with the liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter through the comparison with phenomenological models.

Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $\\pi$-shifted (ISD-$\\pi$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$\\pi$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$\\pi$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$\\pi$ patches."

In addition, materials may transit from a nearly isothermal, rate-independent regime to a viscous, temperature-dependent regime during these processes, which makes modeling more challenging. In this work, we develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) framework for modeling general temperature-dependent, rate-dependent inelastic processes firmly based on physical principles, including the second law of thermodynamics and coordinate equivariance. These embedded properties are enabled by a number of architectural innovations in the structure and training of an input convex and potential-based neural ordinary differential equation framework. The resulting neural network models are capable of representing a wide spectrum of rate- and temperature-dependence ranging from isothermal, rate-independent elastic-plastic phenomenology to rate-dependent fully viscous inelastic behavior, as we demonstrate. We also show that the framework is capable of modeling complex microstructural inelasticity and predicting the conversion of plastic work to heating when calibrated to stress-temperature observations."

In this study, (La$_{0.5}$Pr$_{0.5}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ (LP5CMO) microstructures were fabricated using photolithography on thin films grown on (110) NdGaO$_3$ (NGO) substrates. We investigated the domain reversal mechanism of these microstructures through magnetotransport measurements. Our results demonstrate that, while bulk (unpatterned) films follow the standard Kondorsky model for domain reversal, the microstructures obey a modified Kondorsky model. This difference indicates that local magnetic fields from reversed domains significantly influence the coercive field in confined geometries. Although we did not observe a strong electric field effect, this study establishes that magnetotransport measurements are a feasible method for probing the competition between shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy in manganite microstructures, which could provide an alternative path for controlling magnetic domains at low current densities."

      "summary": "Quantum materials near electronic or magnetic phase boundaries exhibit enhanced tunability, as their emergent properties become highly sensitive to external perturbations. Here, we demonstrate precise control of ferromagnetism in a SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin film, where a high density of states (DOS), arising from low-dimensional quantum states, places the system at the crossover between a non-magnetic and bulk ferromagnetic state. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES/ARPES), transport measurements, and theoretical calculations, we systematically tune the Fermi level via electron doping across the high-DOS point. We directly visualize the spin-split band structure and reveal its influence on both magnetic and transport properties. Our findings provide compelling evidence that magnetism can be engineered through DOS control at a phase crossover, establishing a pathway for the rational design of tunable quantum materials."

      "summary": "The integration of chirality into functional materials enables control of light-matter interactions beyond binary illumination (on/off). Conventional photoactuators rely on binary modulation, limiting them to unidirectional motion. In contrast, we introduce a ternary optical logic paradigm where actuation direction is encoded by the handedness of circularly polarized light (CPL). Here, we establish a chiral Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x}$ MXene platform bridging molecular chirality and mechanical actuation. Phenylalanine enantiomers are covalently anchored onto MXene nanoflakes via chiral nanopainting. The 2D confinement forces ligands into vertically aligned supramolecular networks. Interlayer-spacing analysis and simulations corroborate that such supramolecular networks unlock exceptionally broadband circular dichroism from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. This supramolecular chirality synergizes with MXene's plasmonic properties to drive handedness-dependent photothermal conversion, with a 30\\% differential temperature rise between matched and mismatched CPL. Embedding this chiral MXene into thermoresponsive hydrogels realizes, to the best of our knowledge, the first CPL-driven soft actuator that implements LCP/RCP/off as a ternary input to program multidirectional deformation based on a photothermal mechanism. This molecular-to-macroscopic translation demonstrates a new paradigm for chirality-encoded soft robotics and adaptive photonics."

The leakage current was negligible (under noise-level of tool) up to 6 V and 11 V for 50 nm and 200 nm STO membrane respectively A high-quality dielectric was indicated by the CV profile, which showed almost negligible frequency dispersion in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 500 kHz. The dielectric constant was 50 to 82 with the 50 nm thick STO membrane and 115 to 186 in the 200 nm thick STO membrane. Thermal annealing of the membrane in ambient conditions at 250 degrees for 2 hours led to a slight improvement in the dielectric constant (8 to 20 percent), albeit at the expense of degraded leakage current performance, as indicated by a reduction of 1 V to 3 V in the \"no leakage region\" of the IV curves after annealing. The possible physical mechanisms responsible for these changes were also analyzed and discussed."

      "summary": "We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work~\\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\\\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical closed-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution."

      "summary": "Altermagnets have attracted tremendous interest for revealing intriguing physics and promising spintronics applications. In contrast to conventional antiferromagnets, altermagnets break both PT and Tt symmetries, and simultaneously exhibit spin-split band structures with a vanishing net magnetization. To quantify insulating altermagnets without conduction electron, we propose to use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) to identify the altermagnetic fingerprints. In particular, we demonstrate not only the giant MOKE responses, but also their connection with the orientations of Neel vectors at room temperature in altermagnet hematite alpha-Fe_2O_3. Specifically, under the Neel vector along the [1-100] axis, we find a giant polar Kerr rotation angle 93.4 mdeg in the (11-20) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2'/c'. Under the Neel vector along the [11-20] axis, we find a longitudinal Kerr angle 9.6 mdeg in the (0001) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2/c. Further, we show that such pronounced MOKE effects directly enable an optical imaging of altermagnetic domains, together with their reversible domain wall (DW) motion. Our studies not only suggest MOKE can be used to identify altermagnet candidates, but also signify the feasibility of exploring altermagnetic optical and DW spintronics, which could largely expand the current research paradigm of altermagnetism."

      "summary": "Natural hydrogen generated by water-rock interaction in ultramafic rocks is increasingly recognised as a potentially important primary energy resource, but the pore-scale processes that control the initiation and early transport of a free gas phase remain poorly constrained. Here we present an in situ X-ray micro-tomography experiment in which an ultramafic granular pack of dunnite from West Papua, Indonesia, saturated with KI-doped brine, is heated to 100C with a pore pressure of 4bar under 10bar confining pressure inside a micro-CT scanner. Time-resolved 4D imaging captures the transition from a fully liquid-saturated pore space to the appearance and growth of a distinct gas phase after an 8h induction period. Bubbles first nucleate near the top of the sample before becoming distributed throughout the imaged volume as a connected ganglia. The nucleating gas phase is most plausibly dominated by molecular hydrogen generated by low-temperature fluid-rock reaction, as indicated by independent hydrogen-presence detectors, although we cannot yet fully exclude minor contributions from other gases. SEM-BEX imaging reveals textural alteration and local changes in elemental signals between reacted and unreacted material. Taken together, these observations provide spatially and temporally resolved evidence for gas generation during low-temperature alteration of ultramafic grains and demonstrate that pore-scale imaging can directly link water-rock reaction kinetics, gas generation and multiphase flow behaviour in natural hydrogen systems."

      "summary": "We analyze the effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the dynamics of a system of two or three electrons that can be trapped to a localized state and detrapped to ab extended band states of a quantum dot using a simple model. In spite of its simplicity the time dependent problem has no analytical solution but a numerically exact one can be found at a relatively low computational cost. Within this model, we study the time evolution of the electron occupancies of conduction and valence bands and the trap state, as well as the statistical factors influencing light emission of different energies. In most of the analyzed cases, the system dynamics has a very short transient determined by the hopping parameters, that can be of tens of femptoseconds,followed by a quasi-stationary regime in which the electron occupancies either oscillate periodically around their time-averaged values or remain nearly constant. We find signatures of strong electronic correlations in the electronic motion for negative values of the effective electron-electron Coulomb interaction that are not translated to the statistical factors for light emission. Our calculations show that light emission of different energies is always possible except in the especial cases in which the valence band is initially filled with two electrons. In these cases the valence band can lose and recover electrons periodically but exciton emission is negligible at any time. We use this fact to attempt to give a possible explanation for the increase in the intensity of exciton emission with the concomitant decrease in the intensity of the green emission lines upon continuous illumination with ultraviolet radiation, experimentally observed for ZnO nanoparticles suspended in an alcohol."

      "summary": "Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a cornerstone modern physics, defining a wealth of phenomena in condensed-matter and high-energy physics, and beyond. It requires an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and even then, for continuous symmetries, it only works if the spatial dimension is not too low, following the classic results of Coleman, Hohenberg, Mermin and Wagner. While usually discussed in the context of quantum and statistical field theories, and in particular, effective field theories, there are advantages in addressing the same kind of phenomena on discrete geometric structures rather than conventional manifolds. When the space is discretized into a lattice, a lucid picture of conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking springs up, with the ultraviolet issues of continuum quantum field theory out-of-sight, and the key effect, which is infrared in nature, revealed through elementary harmonic oscillator networks. From there, it is natural to generalize lattices to other graphs/networks. In this setting, the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is controlled by fractional generalizations of resistance distance and the Kirchhoff index, and most broadly by the spectral dimension. Predictably, because of richness of discrete geometric structures in comparison with continuous manifolds, a broader array of geometries emerge where spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is blocked by large fluctuations."

      "summary": "Phase separation in confined environments is a fundamental process underlying geological flows, porous filtration, emulsions, and intracellular organization. Yet, how confinement and activity jointly govern coarsening kinetics and interfacial morphology remains poorly understood. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of passive and active fluids embedded in complex porous media. By generating porous host structures via a freeze-quench protocol, we systematically control the average pore size and demonstrate that confinement induces a crossover from the Lifshitz-Slyozov power-law growth to logarithmically slowed coarsening, ultimately arresting domain evolution. Analysis of correlation functions and structure factors reveals that confined passive systems exhibit fractal interfaces, violating Porod's law and indicating rough morphological arrest. In contrast, introducing self-propulsion dramatically changes the coarsening pathway: activity restores smooth interfaces, breaks the confinement-induced scaling laws, and drives a transition from logarithmic to ballistic domain growth at high activity levels. Our findings reveal an activity-controlled mechanism to overcome geometric restrictions and unlock coarsening in structurally heterogeneous environments. These insights establish a unifying framework for nonequilibrium phase transitions in porous settings, with broad relevance to active colloids, catalytic media, and biologically crowded systems, where living matter routinely reorganizes within geometric constraints to sustain function."

      "summary": "Recent advances in generative machine learning have opened new possibilities for the discovery and design of novel materials. However, as these models become more sophisticated, the need for rigorous and meaningful evaluation metrics has grown. Existing evaluation approaches often fail to capture both the quality and novelty of generated structures, limiting our ability to assess true generative performance. In this paper, we introduce the Transport Novelty Distance (TNovD) to judge generative models used for materials discovery jointly by the quality and novelty of the generated materials. Based on ideas from Optimal Transport theory, TNovD uses a coupling between the features of the training and generated sets, which is refined into a quality and memorization regime by a threshold. The features are generated from crystal structures using a graph neural network that is trained to distinguish between materials, their augmented counterparts, and differently sized supercells using contrastive learning. We evaluate our proposed metric on typical toy experiments relevant for crystal structure prediction, including memorization, noise injection and lattice deformations. Additionally, we validate the TNovD on the MP20 validation set and the WBM substitution dataset, demonstrating that it is capable of detecting both memorized and low-quality material data. We also benchmark the performance of several popular material generative models. While introduced for materials, our TNovD framework is domain-agnostic and can be adapted for other areas, such as images and molecules."

Among the various experimental approaches to detect topological properties, the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) has emerged as a powerful bulk probe in one-dimensional chiral systems, allowing the extraction of the topological invariant from single-particle dynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to multiple cavity modes via inter-cell hopping terms, focusing on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the MCD. We show that, whenever the frequency is larger than the static hopping amplitudes, the coupling induces a discontinuous jump in the MCD, already at small times, signaling that such a coupling also leaves a signature in the survival edge probability when the dynamics are initialized at one of the two edges. For frequencies comparable to the static hopping amplitudes, topological order competes with dissipative effects, which makes the MCD behave smoothly, retaining information about the driven-dissipative topology."

Irradiation causes a linear increase in $\\rho(T)$ and a decrease in the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ with dose $\\phi$.

      "summary": "This work presents a pilot study on a strained complex concentrated alloy based on refractory elements: MoNbTaTiZr. Initially, the as-cast and homogenization-annealed conditions were characterized. After casting, the alloy consists of two solid solutions with BCC 1 and BCC 2 crystal structures. Homogenization annealing promotes the growth, ordering, and refinement of the BCC 2 phase. TEM and AES analyses indicate possible Zr segregation at grain boundaries in the as-cast state. In contrast, annealing followed by cooling results in the formation of Ti-Zr-based particles without segregation. Subsequently, the annealed alloy was cold-rolled, and its microstructure was investigated. During rolling, grain fragmentation occurs within the structure. In addition to the two BCC solid solutions, a phase with an FCC crystal structure is identified after rolling. Its composition corresponds to the Zr2Ta phase, which is a Laves phase of the A2B type. Rotational relationships, relatively rare in rolled materials with BCC structures, are identified. The texture components found after 10% rolling deformation are related to that present after 20% deformation by a 45 degrees rotation, and this component is related to that appearing after 30% deformation by a 20 degrees rotation. However, no distinct rolling texture or clear texture development was observed, although some mutual relationships among preferred orientations can be identified. Schmid and Taylor factor maps demonstrate that, despite deformation, the alloy remains capable of further strain accumulation and plastic deformation. Twinning is also observed after rolling, which may be beneficial, as deformation twinning contributes to improved ductility in the alloy."

      "summary": "In a structure with two tunnel-coupled quantum wells of different widths, the spin dynamics resulting from resonant pulsed optical pumping of the narrow-well exciton includes the wide-well electron magnetization dynamics. Our analysis shows that the effect is driven by electron exchange between narrow-well excitons and spin-polarized electrons in the wide well. A theoretical model of the spin Kerr effect has been developed accounting for the interwell electron spin exchange. In the studied double-well structure with CdTe and Cd$_{0.98}$Mn$_{0.02}$Te quantum wells and a well-separating barrier thickness of 5 monolayers (1.6 nm), the model accurately describes the experimental results and allows us to estimate the interwell electron exchange constant as $\\delta_{e} \\approx 0.9\\times10^{-15}~\\textrm{eV}~\\textrm{cm}^{2}$."

      "summary": "We introduce a high-throughput platform that enables simultaneous, parallel testing of six bistable beams via programmable motion of a rotating disk. By prescribing harmonic angular dynamics, the platform explores the phase space of angular velocity and acceleration $(\\Omega,\\,\\dot{\\Omega})$, producing continuously varying centrifugal and Euler force fields that act as tunable body forces in our specimens. Image processing extracts beam kinematics with sub-pixel accuracy, enabling precise identification of snap-through events. By testing six beams in parallel, the platform allows systematic variation of beam thickness, pre-compression, tilt angle, and clamp orientations across 65 distinct configurations, generating 23,400 individual experiments. We construct stability boundaries and quantitatively parameterize them as parabolic functions, characterized by a vertical offset and a curvature parameter. Tilt angle provides the most robust mechanism for tuning the curvature parameter, while beam thickness and pre-compression modulate vertical offset. Modal decomposition analysis reveals that antisymmetric clamp configurations can trigger mode switching, in which competing geometric and inertial effects drive transitions through different deformation pathways. Our work establishes a scalable experimental framework for high-throughput characterization of dynamic nonlinear instabilities in mechanics. The complete experimental dataset is made publicly available to support data-driven design and machine learning models for nonlinear mechanics with applications to bistability-based metamaterials, mechanical memory, and electronics-free sensing systems."

      "summary": "Cuprate superconductors remain central to condensed matter physics due to their technological relevance and unconventional, incompletely understood electronic behavior. While the canonical phase diagram and low-energy models have been shaped largely by studies of underdoped and moderately doped cuprates, the overdoped regime has received comparatively limited attention.Here, we track the evolution of the electronic structure from optimal to heavy overdoping in La2-xSrxCuO4(LSCO) using broadband optical spectroscopy across x=0.15-0.60. The measured spectral changes--including the redistribution of Zhang-Rice-related spectral weigh--are in qualitative agreement with determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the three-orbital Emery model, which together indicate a pronounced reconstruction of the electronic structure beyond hole concentrations x>0.2. Guided by these observations, we propose a spontaneous checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice electronic configuration that captures the coexistence of itinerant and localized carriers characteristic of the heavily overdoped state. Our results refine the doping-dependent Zhang-Rice-based framework for cuprates, illuminate how correlations persist deep into the overdoped regime, and provide new constraints on microscopic mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity, with broader implications for correlated transition-metal oxides."

However, the magnetic ground state of monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6 remains elusive due to fragile and irregular-shaped thin flake samples with weak magnetic signals. Here, we successfully grow uniform ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 films down to monolayer by molecular beam epitaxy. By exploiting a self-limiting growth mode, we achieve synthesis of uniform monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6 films across entire millimeter-scale Si substrates. Through a combination of superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry and anomalous Hall effect measurements, we establish that monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6 exhibits intrinsic ferromagnetism with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy below ~10 K, albeit with strong magnetic fluctuations characteristic of its two-dimensional nature. Furthermore, a systematic thickness-dependent study reveals a crossover from this fluctuation-dominated two-dimensional magnetism turns into conventional long-range ferromagnetic order as the film thickness increases. Our work not only definitively establishes the intrinsic ferromagnetic ground state of monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6, but also provides a scalable, silicon-compatible route for preparing the two-dimensional magnet for future spintronic or quantum devices."

      "summary": "To develop a more universal luminescent thermometer that provides both high relative sensitivity and the ability to measure temperature across different spectral ranges and excitation wavelengths, the K3Yb(PO4)2:Eu3+ system was proposed in this work. It was demonstrated that this material undergoes a structural phase transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal phase above 450 K. This transition enabled the construction of a ratiometric, phase-transition-based thermometer utilizing the luminescence intensity ratio of Stark lines of Eu3+ and Yb3+ ions, which exhibit SRmax values of 4.2% K^-1 and 1.15% K^-1, respectively. Moreover, increasing the Eu3+ ion concentration was shown to raise the phase transition temperature, thereby shifting the thermal operating range of both luminescent thermometers. Under 980 nm excitation, K3Yb(PO4)2:Eu3+ exhibits both cooperative luminescence from Yb3+ pairs and up-conversion emission from Eu3+ ions. Increasing the Eu3+ concentration enhances the Eu3+ luminescence intensity relative to the cooperative luminescence of Yb3+ pairs, resulting in a change in the emitted light color. The difference in the thermal quenching behavior of these two signals further enabled the development of a ratiometric thermometer with SRmax = 0.58% K^-1. These findings identify K3Yb(PO4)3:Eu3+ as a promising candidate for multimodal temperature sensing."

Here, we report the single-crystal growth, structural characterization, magnetic and electric properties of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, a nabokoite-type compound featuring a distorted and decorated square-kagome lattice. Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic transition.The formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\\mathrm{FE1}\\sim30$ K and $T_\\mathrm{FE2}\\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra.

These conserved quantities are related to the microscopic quantum degrees of freedom that are spatially localized. Here, we present a general framework for constructing exact LIOMs with the desired locality and quantum numbers supplied as input rather than arising as emergent properties. We show that one can express the task of finding LIOMs as an optimization problem. In simple cases, solving this problem amounts to matrix diagonalization, while in more complex settings, it connects to the question of finding classical ground states of spin-glass models. We illustrate our theory using paradigmatic examples of single-particle Anderson localization and MBL in interacting spin chains. These developments unify previous results and reveal intriguing connections among many-body localization, spin-glass physics and constrained optimization problems."

Orientational chemotaxis manifests as a torque that steers the particle toward the chemical gradient. As each particle is coupled to its own trail, the dynamics exhibits an instability: when the particle gently diffuses, it abruptly transitions to trajectories with a radius of curvature comparable to its own size, becoming apparently trapped. We argue that, contrary to intuition, this trajectory instability occurs for any chemotactic coupling strength. Depending on the coupling regime, this arises either through a potential-barrier first-passage problem or from a rare event analysis."

Second, a sufficiently weak exchange interaction ensures that the bright exciton remains energetically below the dark exciton state. We further show that the bright exciton ground state is stable under various mechanical strains and that trion states (charged excitons) inherit this bright ground state. Our findings are expected to spark further investigation into related materials that bring along the two key features mentioned, as bright ground-state excitons are crucial for applications requiring fast radiative recombination."

      "summary": "Massless Dirac particles avoid trapping due to their exceptional tunneling properties manifested in the so-called Klein paradox. This conclusion stems from the conservative treatment, but so far, it has not been extended to a non-Hermitian framework. Recently, driven-dissipative bosonic condensation of Dirac exciton-polaritons was demonstrated in metasurface waveguides. Here, we report an experimental observation of spatial binding and energy quantization of Dirac exciton-polaritons in a halide perovskite metasurface. A combination of spatially profiled nonresonant optical excitation and exciton-polariton interaction forms an effective non-Hermitian complex potential responsible for the observed effect. In the case of tightly focused pump spots spanning from 9 to 17~$\\mu$m, several bound states simultaneously achieve macroscopic occupation, constituting a multi-mode bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons. Our theoretical analysis based on the driven-dissipative extension of the Dirac equation reveals that the non-Hermitian character of the effective trap allows for confinement even in the case of the gapless Dirac-like photonic dispersion, both above and below the energy of the dispersion crossing."

The introduction of spin centers via doping can lead to promising materials for spintronics, magnetic sensing, and data storage. We study the effect of V doping in Ti2C using first principle and Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results show that pristine Ti2C exhibits ferromagnetic intralayer and antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange interactions, yielding an antiferromagnetic ground state. Vanadium incorporation alters these couplings, yet all doped configurations - Ti7VC4 and three Ti6V2C4 variants - retain predominantly antiferromagnetic order. Despite the preserved ground state, V doping enhances the magnetic response, most notably in the p-Ti6V2C4 configuration, which displays increased low-field susceptibility and partial spin alignment across layers. As experimentally isolating individual doped phases is unlikely, samples will consist of mixed configurations whose collective behavior nonetheless exhibits clear signatures of V-induced magnetic modification. These results reveal how transition-metal substitution tunes exchange interactions in MXenes and offer guidance for engineering their magnetic functionalities."

      "summary": "In this work, we investigate the combined effects of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and non-Hermiticity on topological phase transitions in spinful p-wave Kitaev chains. While previous studies have separately examined non-Hermitian (NH) extensions of Kitaev chains and the effects of RSOC in Hermitian systems, the interplay between these two mechanisms remains largely unexplored. We analyze this interplay by considering two distinct types of complex on-site potentials: (i) a uniform gain/loss term and (ii) a complex quasiperiodic potential. We demonstrate that the impact of RSOC is highly model-dependent. In particular, RSOC does not affect the topological phase boundary in the Hermitian limit of the uniform gain/loss model (provided the spin-flip hopping is weaker than the pairing strength), but significantly alters the topological landscape in the NH regime. In contrast, for the quasiperiodic model, RSOC modifies the phase boundaries in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases. Notably, we find that the combined interplay of non-Hermiticity and RSOC drives topological transitions at significantly lower potential strengths compared to the Hermitian limit. We derive analytical expressions for the topological phase transitions in both cases and validate our predictions through numerical calculations of energy spectra and real-space winding numbers. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how non-Hermiticity and RSOC cooperatively reshape topological phase diagrams in one-dimensional superconducting systems."

In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation."

In this work, we study several terminations of the (010) surface of $\\gamma$-belite, its most stable polymorph, by molecular dynamics simulations. The energies and forces are provided by a high-dimensional neural network potential trained to density functional theory data. Water can interact in molecular form as well as dissociatively with the investigated interfaces, and the degree of dissociation is determined primarily by the protonation of SiO$_4$ groups accessible at the surface. A major part of the simultaneously formed hydroxide ions is adsorbed at surface calcium atoms, whose octahedral coordination spheres are completed by additional water molecules. The T3 termination, which is most stable in vacuum, shows only little reactivity in water. For the only slightly less stable T2 termination, however, two distinct types of surface defects are observed. The type I defect is even stable in vacuum and leads to a reconstruction of the entire surface, while the type II defect is only found in the presence of water. Overall, our results suggest that a variety of structures may be formed at the Ca$_2$SiO$_4$(010) surface, which are stabilized in the presence of water."

      "summary": "In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intemediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be infered through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentialy the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dialate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguements for the general case."

For large $N$, it maps onto the deterministic two-oscillator Kuramoto model of synchronization. Despite its simplicity, we postulate its relevance for understanding more complex and realistic oscillator systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the model exhibits a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition between the unsynchronized and synchronized states. We show that this transition is not governed by any extremum dissipation principle -- depending on system parameters, synchronization may either reduce or enhance the dissipation. Close to the phase transition, we observe a divergent behavior of fluctuations and responses with $N$ and characterize their universal scaling behavior. In particular, the covariances of the oscillator phases and the local entropy productions are shown to diverge towards $-\\infty$, a phenomenon that has not been reported before. Finally, we study the behavior of information-theoretic quantities, demonstrating that mutual information and information flow between oscillators display different scaling with $N$ in synchronized and unsynchronized states, and thus can act as order parameters of synchronization."

Remarkably, for states non-invariant under parity we find Burgers equation arising in the hydrodynamic limit. We explicitly compute the diffusion constant and nonlinear Euler-scale coupling of the Burgers equation using a variant of the Chapman-Enskog theory. We find excellent agreement between our theory and numerical simulations of a simplified model of stochastic two-body collisions, which we call velocity swap models. Our conclusions are based only on Galilean invariance, existence of a small system-bath coupling parameter and a small momentum exchange between the system and the bath."

      "summary": "Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction [LEED $I(V)$] is a powerful method for surface-structure determination, based on a direct comparison of experimentally observed $I(V)$ data with computations for a structure model. As the diffraction intensities $I$ are highly sensitive to subtle structural changes, local structure optimization is essential for assessing the validity of a structure model and finding the best-fit structure. The calculation of diffraction intensities is well established, but the large number of evaluations required for reliable structural optimization renders it computationally demanding. The computational effort is mitigated by the tensor-LEED approximation, which accelerates optimization by applying a perturbative treatment of small deviations from a reference structure. Nevertheless, optimization of complex structures is a tedious process. Here, the problem of surface-structure optimization is reformulated using a tree-based data structure, which helps to avoid redundant function evaluations. In the new tensor-LEED implementation presented in this work, intensities are computed on the fly, eliminating limitations of previous algorithms that are limited to precomputed values at a grid of search parameters. It also enables the use of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Implemented in \\textsc{Python} with the JAX library, the method provides access to gradients of the $R$ factor and supports execution on graphics processing units (GPUs). Based on these developments, the computing time can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude."

We modify the standard setup by allowing the target to spontaneously switch between two states, either active or inactive, and investigate the distribution of first hitting times accrued while the target is active. For this setup, we provide closed formulas for the distribution of the first hitting time. Additionally, we can introduce stochastic resetting to the underlying process and, utilizing our results, derive the formulas for the first time the active target is hit by the process under stochastic resetting. Interestingly, we show that resetting in this setup still leaves some memory; the system is no longer Markovian, which prevents a straightforward application of standard techniques. The analytical results are accompanied by computer simulations of Langevin dynamics."

Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ has been widely regarded as a leading candidate, yet the nature of its phase transition and insulating state remains controversial. Here, we report a systematic Raman spectroscopy study of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ as a function of thickness and field-effect doping, complemented by electrical transport measurements. The phase transition persists down to the monolayer limit, with the critical temperature increasing as thickness decreases. In bilayer samples, both electron and hole doping suppress the insulating state, with electron doping lowering and hole doping raising the transition temperature. Importantly, the quasi-elastic scattering, previously attributed to excitonic fluctuations, evolves monotonically across the entire doping range, inconsistent with the expected suppression of excitonic correlations by Coulomb screening. These findings rule out a dominant excitonic mechanism and instead point to a coupled electronic and structural phase transition, whose stability is tunable by carrier doping. Our doping-based approach offers a general strategy for evaluating the role of excitonic effects in candidate excitonic insulators."

We interpret the results in terms of a molecular Bose gas in quasi-two-dimensional confinement and compare them with theoretical predictions for a weakly interacting two-dimensional Bose gas, identifying the range of validity of mean-field and beyond-mean-field descriptions. We also develop an analytical theory for the transverse density profile, capturing its broadening with increasing interaction strength.

Here we use a cruciform bending platform to apply uniform biaxial strain up to 1.3% to trilayer WS2 while simultaneously monitoring excitonic and vibrational responses. Differential reflectance reveals strain-induced red-shifts of the A and B excitons, with the B exciton moving by about 170 meV. Under 532 nm excitation, this shift drives a continuous transition from resonant to non-resonant Raman scattering, leading to a pronounced collapse of the 2LA(M) mode. The 2LA(M) intensity is quantitatively described by a resonance model expressed in terms of the B-exciton energy, which yields an effective exciton-assisted linewidth of about 34 meV and shows that the maximum enhancement occurs when the laser lies roughly 50 meV below the exciton. The first-order phonons remain narrow and reversible over the full strain cycle, confirming elastic deformation and efficient isotropic strain transfer. Our results establish biaxial strain as a practical and reversible route to modulate exciton-phonon coupling and Raman scattering cross-sections, enabling mechanically reconfigurable optical and photonic functionalities in layered semiconductors."

      "summary": "Moore's law has long served the semiconductor industry as the driving force for producing ever-advancing electronics technologies. However, given the economic implications and technological challenges associated with the present semiconductor scaling constraints, a shift from a traditional more Moore approach to a beyond Moore paradigm is desirable for sustaining the current pace of innovation beyond the established development route. Resistive random-access memories (RRAM) are one such beyond Moore technology that offers many avenues for innovation, and when integrated with mature complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS), can extend CMOS capabilities in a scalable and power-efficient manner, both in terms of memory and computation. Nevertheless, as emerging and established technologies fuse, existing semiconductor-optimised manufacturing faces significant challenges, while the methodologies and complexities of integration are often not highlighted in depth, or overlooked at the expense of demonstrating the application-specific integrated-technologies. In this article, we focus on the integration, and detail a cost-effective, rapid-prototyping, and technology agnostic CMOS-RRAM integration strategy that employs hybridised wafer-level and multi-reticle processing techniques, supported by a systematic increased complexity approach. Leveraging the fact that CMOS technologies can be readily realised by taking advantage of mature front-end-of-line fabrication processes offered by semiconductor foundries, we establish an in-house RRAM development program that allows to combine fundamental material and device-level knowledge with custom-designed CMOS electronics. This approach utilises fully CMOS-compatible and transferable processes, ultimately enabling a seamless transition from research and development to volume production."

These include the one- and two-point probability distributions of the velocity, the multiplicity functions of voids and shocks, and the velocity and density correlation functions together with their associated power spectra. We also show that the full hierarchy of $n$-point distributions factorizes into a sequence of two-point conditional probabilities. This class of initial conditions leads to self-similar evolution and produces probability distributions characterized by stretched-exponential tails, with tail exponents spanning the full range from unity to infinity. The associated characteristic length scale grows as a power law of time, with an exponent lying between zero and one half."

      "summary": "Second harmonic (SH) radiation can only be generated in non-centrosymmetric bulk crystals under electric dipole approximation. Nonlinear thin films made from bulk crystals are technologically challenging because of complex and high temperature fabrication processes. In this work, heterostructures made of amorphous materials SiO$_2$ and TiO$_2$ were prepared by a CMOS-compatible technique named plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) with deposition temperature at 100 {\\deg}C. By using the uniaxial dispersion model, we characterized the form-birefringence property, which can enable the phase matching condition in waveguides or other nonlinear optical applications. By applying a fringe-based technique, we determined the largest diagonal component of the effective second-order bulk susceptibility $\\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$ = 1.30$\\pm$0.13 pm/V at a wavelength of 1032 nm. Noteworthy, we observed strong SHG signals from two-component nanolaminates which are several orders of magnitude larger than from single layers. The SHG signals from our samples only require the broken inversion symmetry at the interface. Here optical properties of nanocomposites can be precisely tuned by the promising PEALD technology."

      "summary": "Strong coupling between optical and magnetic excitations could enable contactless, spatially resolved, or ultrafast interrogation and control of magnetism two-dimensional (2D) materials and devices. The layered 2D A-type antiferromagnet CrPS4 stands out among van der Waals (vdW) magnets for its rich optical fine structure, but its spectroscopy is not yet understood and has so far been interpreted without consideration of magnetic exchange. Here, we show that this fine structure comes primarily from exchange-mediated coupling between on-site optical \"spin-flip\" transitions of Cr3+ and low-energy spin transitions involving the surrounding lattice. Well-resolved magnon sidebands to optical 4A2 2E transitions are observed in photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation spectra, as well as a pronounced PL sideband due to short-range exchange splitting. Energy migration is probed using Yb3+ dopants as traps, revealing sub-picosecond inter-site excitation hopping. Formation of dispersive Frenkel excitons of coupled on-site d-d transitions due to inter-site exchange is discussed. In addition to impacting how optical fine structure is interpreted in this and potentially other vdW magnets, these findings may have ramifications for future applications of layered 2D magnets by revealing new opportunities to drive mode-specific spin-wave excitations using light."

      "summary": "The collective motion of arrays of cilia - tiny, hairlike protrusions - drives the locomotion of numerous microorganisms, enabling multimodal motion and autonomous switching between gaits to navigate complex environments. To endow minimalist centimeter-scale robots with similarly rich dynamics, we introduce millimeter-scale flexible cilia that buckle under the robots weight, coupling multistability and actuation within a single physical mechanism. When placed on a vibrating surface, these ciliary walkers select their propulsion direction through the buckled states of their cilia, allowing multimodal motion and switching between modes in response to perturbations. We first show that bimodal walkers with left-right symmetric cilia can autonomously reverse direction upon encountering obstacles. Next, we demonstrate that walkers with isotropic cilia exhibit both translational and rotational motion and switch between them in response to environmental interactions. At increasing densities, swarms of such walkers collectively transition from predominantly spinning to translational motion. Finally, we show that the shape, placement and number of cilia controls the modes of motion of the walkers. Our results establish a rational, physically grounded strategy for designing minimalist soft robots where complex behaviors emerge from feedback between internal mechanical states and environmental interactions, laying the foundation for autonomous robotic collectives without the need for centralized control."

Within a mean-field approximation of the attractive Hubbard model, we obtain the superconducting order parameters on the three inequivalent sublattices and show their strong dependence on $\\alpha$, interaction strength, and electron filling. At quasi-flat band filling, a superconducting gap opens and grows power-law fast with interaction strength, instead of the usual slow exponential growth, due to diverging density of states. We calculate the superfluid weight from linear response theory and study its band dispersion and geometric contributions. While the conventional part proportional to band derivatives is suppressed in the quasi-flat band regime, the contribution dominated by the quantum metric grows linearly for small interaction strength. We further demonstrate how tuning $\\alpha$ enhances the quantum metric and thus the geometric superfluid weight especially near half-filling, while increasing on-site asymmetries increases the conventional contribution by broadening the quasi-flat band. We obtain the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and demonstrate its strong dependence and enhancement with the parameter $\\alpha$. Our results establish a tunable flat band system, the $\\alpha$-$\\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice model, as a candidate for tunable quantum geometry and superfluid weight and as a prototype of related behavior in tunable quantum materials."

Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms."

In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures."

When integrated in quantum many-body dynamics, they can give rise to novel non-equilibrium phase transitions both at the level of each individual quantum trajectory and the averaged quantum channel. Experimentally resolving both transitions on realistic devices has been challenging due to limitations on the fidelity and the significant latency for performing mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations in real time. Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class. Crucially, the two transitions occur at distinct values of the tuning parameter. Our results demonstrate that adaptive quantum circuits provide a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics."

However, a theoretical description of these dynamics beyond 1D remains a significant challenge for conventional methods. Here, we address this challenge by means of neural quantum states to simulate global quenches from the fully polarized ferromagnetic state in the 2D quantum Ising model with power-law decaying interactions. From these numerically exact simulations, we find that the dynamics exhibit slow relaxation with long-lived oscillations. We explain this behavior through a theory for the formation of magnon bound states, which are generated, as we show, through effective attractive interactions between magnons that persist over several lattice sites due to the power-law nature of the interactions. Our results are readily observable in current quantum simulation platforms realizing long-range interacting models such as in Rydberg atomic systems."

Motivated by experiments in Rydberg quantum simulators, recent excitement has centered on the possibility of dynamically preparing a state with quantum spin liquid correlation even when the ground state phase diagram does not exhibit such a topological phase. Understanding the microscopic nature of such quantum spin \"lake\" states and their relationship to equilibrium spin liquid order remains an essential question. Here, we extend the use of approximately symmetric neural quantum states for real-time evolution and directly simulate the dynamical preparation in systems of up to $N=384$ atoms. We analyze a variety of spin liquid diagnostics as a function of the preparation protocol and optimize the extent of the quantum spin lake thus obtained. In the optimal case, the prepared state shows spin-liquid properties extending over half the system size, with a topological entanglement entropy plateauing close to $\\gamma = \\ln 2$. We extract two physical length scales $\\lambda$ and $\\xi$ which constrain the extent of the quantum spin lake $\\ell$ from above and below."

Understanding neural network OOD generalization is paramount to their successful deployment in experimental workflows, especially when ground-truth knowledge about the experiment is hard to establish or experimental conditions significantly vary. With inherent access to ground-truth information and fine-grained control of underlying distributions, simulation-based data curation facilitates precise investigation of OOD generalization behavior. Here, we probe generalization with respect to imaging conditions of neural network segmentation models for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging of nanoparticles, training and measuring the OOD generalization of over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data generated via random structure sampling and multislice simulation. Using the HRTEM contrast transfer function, we further develop a framework to compare information content of HRTEM datasets and quantify OOD domain shifts. We demonstrate that neural network segmentation models enjoy significant performance stability, but will smoothly and predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. Lastly, we consider limitations of our approach in explaining other OOD shifts, such as of the atomic structures, and discuss complementary techniques for understanding generalization in such settings."

Here, we report a surfactant-free, solvent-directed laser synthesis strategy to engineer the phase and optoelectronic properties of Cadmium Phosphorus Trisulfide (CdPS3). By exploiting the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL), we demonstrate a tunable transition from the stoichiometric ternary phase to a highly active binary-rich heterostructure. While ablation in water preserves the monoclinic CdPS3 lattice, the reducing environment of isopropanol triggers the formation of CdS quantum dots and metallic cadmium defect sites. This solvent-induced phase engineering transforms the ultraviolet-active host into a robust visible-light photocatalyst. The resulting hybrid CdPS3/CdS nanocolloids exhibit superior charge separation efficiency, driven by Schottky-like metal-semiconductor junctions, achieving ~ 90% degradation of Methylene Blue under 532 nm irradiation within 30 minutes. This work establishes fs-PLAL as a scalable defect-engineering tool for complex ternary layered materials, offering a new design of high-performance metal-thiophosphate-based photocatalysts."

They identify topological problems and resolve them by passing a double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break in another segment. The precise mechanisms underpinning topo IIs ability to maintain a topologically simple genome are not fully understood. Here, we investigate how binding kinetics affects the resolution of two distinct forms of topological entanglement: decatenation and torsional relaxation. First, by single-molecule measurements, we quantify how monovalent cation concentration affects the dissociation rate of topo II from DNA. Second, we discover that increasing dissociation rates accelerate decatenation while slowing down relaxation catalytic activities. Finally, by using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that this opposite behaviour is due to a trade-off between search of target through facilitated diffusion and processivity of the enzyme in catenated versus supercoiled DNA. Thus, our findings reveal that a modulation of topo II binding kinetics can oppositely regulate its topological simplification activity, and in turn can have a significant impact in vivo."

      "summary": "Non-thermal plasma (NTP) surface activation has become a powerful and versatile strategy to engineer the interfacial properties of biomedical polymers whose intrinsic hydrophobicity limits their biological performance. In polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC), NTP promotes the controlled incorporation of polar functional groups, increases surface energy, modifies dielectric behavior, and generates micro-roughness that collectively enhance protein adsorption and early cell adhesion. This review synthesizes and critically evaluates evidence across four complementary analytical pillars-contact-angle theory, dielectric impedance spectroscopy, FT-IR chemical mapping, and optical microscopy-to construct an integrated framework for interpreting plasma-induced chemical and morphological transformations. The convergence of multimodal results demonstrates that NTP consistently produces chemically active, polar, and moderately textured surfaces that support robust initial cell-material interactions. Furthermore, combining wettability, dielectric, and spectroscopic analysis enables the identification of activation pathways, the assessment of hydrophobic recovery dynamics, and the development of quantitative correlations between dielectric parameters and biological response. However, the literature also reveals key methodological gaps, including the limited use of unified multimodal protocols, insufficient evaluation of temporal stability, and a lack of predictive dielectric-biological models. By articulating these advances and limitations within a unified conceptual scheme, this review provides a roadmap for future research aimed at standardizing characterization workflows and enabling the rational design of next-generation plasma-functionalized biomaterials for tissue-engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and advanced drug-delivery systems."

Here, we establish Na2Zn2TeO6 (NZTO), a P2-type superionic conductor, as an exfoliable non-vdW optical material. We demonstrate that the highly disordered, mobile Na+ interlayer inherently facilitates mechanical cleavage down to few-nanometer thicknesses (about 4 nm). Optical interrogation via spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals NZTO as a wide-bandgap dielectric with pronounced optical birefringence (Delta_n about 0.25) across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. The lattice dynamics, probed by temperature-resolved Raman spectroscopy, underscore the rigidity of the [Zn2TeO6]2- framework, which remains largely decoupled from the high ionic mobility. These results identify NZTO as a compelling platform for robust, anisotropic dielectric photonics, simultaneously opening a pathway toward the convergence of ionic transport and optical control - an emerging paradigm we term iono-photonics."

Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exceptional optical properties, including high refractive indices and giant anisotropy, but their implementation is constrained by the small area and uncontrolled thickness of mechanically exfoliated flakes. Here, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown gallium sulfide (GaS) overcomes the trade-off between high optical performance and manufacturability, emerging as a large-scale vdW dielectric platform. Through rigorous optical and structural benchmarking against pristine single crystals, we establish that the optical constants (n, k) of ALD-GaS are virtually indistinguishable from single-crystal counterparts. By leveraging the retained out-of-plane anisotropy, we demonstrate that ALD-GaS enables superior suppression of crosstalk in densely integrated waveguides compared to conventional scalable high-index platforms. Our findings establish ALD-GaS as a technologically viable pathway for implementing anisotropic vdW materials in visible-spectrum photonics."

      "summary": "Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences."

These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water."

Moreover, our model supports non-sinusoidal current-phase relations of the rf-SQUID's Josephson junction, allowing, for the first time, for the modeling of devices based on Josephson tunnel junctions with inhomogeneous tunnel barriers. We show that the effects of such inhomogeneities are qualitatively similar to, yet distinct from, those of the screening parameter, making their inclusion essential for accurate characterization. Incorporating these effects yields great improved agreement with measurements, even at readout power conditions well beyond typical operating parameters."

Here, we propose a hybrid quantum architecture comprising a magnonic mode (in a YIG sphere), an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ), and a superconducting qubit (SCQ), to realize a strong three-body interaction at the single-quantum level. Leveraging the spin-dependent supercurrent and circuit-integration flexibility of the ASQ, it is possible to engineer a strong tripartite coupling that jointly excites both qubits upon magnon annihilation (or excites magnons and SCQs upon ASQ deexcitation). Through analytical and numerical studies, we demonstrate that this interaction induces synchronized collapse and revival in qubit populations when the magnon is initially prepared in a coherent state. Notably, during the collapse region -- where populations remain static -- the entanglement structure undergoes a dramatic and continuous reorganization. We show that the genuine tripartite entanglement is redistributed into bipartite entanglement between the two qubits, and vice versa, with the total entanglement conserved. These phenomena, unattainable via two-body couplings, underscore the potential of three-body interactions for exploring intrinsically new quantum effects and advancing hybrid quantum information platforms."

The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle."

      "summary": "Accurate prediction of the frequency response of quantum dots under electromagnetic radiation is essential for investigating absorption spectra, excitonic effects, and nonlinear optical behavior in quantum dots and semiconductor nanoparticles. The polarization propagator provides a rigorous framework for evaluating these properties, but its construction is computationally demanding. Challenges arise from the level of electron correlation, the size of the excitonic basis, and the cost of evaluating two-electron integrals. This work addresses these difficulties by developing first- and second-order frequency-dependent polarization propagator calculations for PbS and CdS quantum dots. The propagator is formulated using the electron propagator approach and expressed as the resolvent of the Hamiltonian superoperator. Light-matter interaction is treated using the dipole approximation and represented in a particle-hole excitation operator basis. The correlated ground state is treated at the MP2 level, and all response-matrix terms up to second order in the fluctuating potential are included. A frequency-dependent inverse Krylov subspace method is derived and combined with the folded-spectrum technique to isolate excitation energies within a chosen frequency window. This strategy avoids full diagonalization of the response matrix and significantly reduces computational cost for large systems. The method is implemented in a matrix-free manner in which no explicit response matrix is assembled, and all operations rely on matrix-vector products. UV-VIS excitation spectra of PbS and CdS quantum dots were computed, demonstrating that the inverse Krylov subspace projection approach provides an efficient and accurate approximation for excitation spectra when full diagonalization is computationally prohibitive."

The novelty of this platform lies in its direct access to the reciprocal space, which enables us to scan the quasi-momentum across the entire Brillouin zone and thus achieve a precise tomographic reconstruction of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, indicated by the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. From the inferred Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve complex-valued band structures, resolve exceptional points in momentum space, and detect the associated parity-time symmetry breaking through eigenvector coalescence.

We demonstrate that the onset of CDW instability requires a threshold bias voltage set by the energy of in-gap edge modes. At sufficiently large voltages, the system undergoes an abrupt transition to a metallic state, reminiscent of dielectric breakdown. In the intermediate-voltage regime, our simulations reveal that the transition to a low-resistance state is initiated by the nucleation of a thin conducting layer at the gated electrode. The resulting metal-insulator interface subsequently propagates across the system under the applied bias, leading to the growth of a metallic domain. We further analyze the voltage- and temperature-dependent dynamics of the associated domain walls."

In particular, the experimental report of a half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in the presence of a magnetic field has generated excitement as it could be strong evidence for a field-induced chiral spin liquid. More recent experiments, however, provide a conflicting interpretation advocating for topological magnons in the field-polarized state as the origin of the non-quantized thermal Hall conductivity observed in their experiments. An inherent difficulty in distinguishing between the two scenarios is the phase transition between a putative two-dimensional spin liquid and the field-polarized state exists only at zero temperature, while the behaviour at finite temperature is mostly crossover phenomena. In this work, we provide insights into the finite temperature crossover behavior between the spin excitation continuum in a quantum spin liquid and topological magnons in the field-polarized state in three different theoretical models with large Kitaev interactions. These models allow for a field-induced phase transition from a spin liquid (or an intermediate field-induced spin liquid) to the field-polarized state in the quantum model. We obtain the dynamical spin structure factor as a function of magnetic field using molecular dynamics simulations and compute thermal Hall conductivity in the field-polarized regime. We demonstrate the gradual evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor exhibiting crossover behaviour near magnetic fields where zero-temperature phase transitions occur in the quantum model. We also examine nonlinear effects on topological magnons and the validity of thermal Hall conductivity computed using linear spin wave theory. We discuss the implications of our results to existing and future experiments."

      "summary": "Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) has traditionally been one of the primary methods for investigating quantum magnets, particularly in identifying a continuum of excitations as a hallmark of spin fractionalization in quantum spin liquids (QSLs). However, INS faces severe limitations due to its inability to distinguish between such QSL signatures and similar excitation continua arising from highly frustrated magnetic orders with large unit cells or classical spin liquids. In contrast, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nonlinear excitation dynamics, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these broad spectral features. In this paper, we utilize classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to explore the 2DCS responses of frustrated magnets with dominant Kitaev interactions. Comparing the classical and quantum versions of the pure Kitaev model our results indicate both clear similarities, in the form of sharp line features, and clear distinctions, in the locations of these features and in selection rules. Moreover, in the extended $K\\Gamma\\Gamma'$ model, we show that the 2DCS response of the Kitaev spin liquid is completely distinct from that of large unit cell magnetic orders, despite both generating a broad continuum in INS. Additionally, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of classical 2DCS to thermal fluctuations and discuss the potential significance of quantum coherence in experimental settings. Overall, our work illustrates the potential of 2DCS in resolving the complex physics underlying ambiguous spin excitation continua, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics in these frustrated systems."

      "summary": "When sheared, granular media experience localized plastic events known as shear transformations which generate anisotropic internal stresses. Under strong confining pressure, the response of granular media to local force multipoles is essentially linear, resulting in quadrupolar propagated stresses. This can lead to additional plastic events along the direction of relative stress increase. Closer to the unjamming transition however, as the confining pressure and the shear modulus vanish, nonlinearities become relevant. Yet, the consequences of these nonlinearities on the stress response to plastic events remains poorly understood. We show with granular dynamics simulations that this brings about an isotropization of the propagated stresses, in agreement with a previously developed continuum elastic model. This could significantly modify the yielding transition of weakly-jammed amorphous media, which has been conceptualized as an avalanche of such plastic events."

We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied. We propose exploiting the extended nature of edge-like MSs as effective interconnects enabling the coupling between topological states in adjacent planar JJs. The impact of electrostatic disorder on the MSs is also analyzed."

      "summary": "We propose a non-collinear spin-constrained method that generates training data for deep-learning-based magnetic model, which provides a powerful tool for studying complex magnetic phenomena that requires large-scale simulations at the atomic level. First, we propose a basis-independent projection method for calculating atomic magnetic moments by applying a radial truncation to numerical atomic orbitals. A double-loop Lagrange multiplier method is utilized to ensure the satisfaction of constraint conditions while achieving accurate magnetic torque. The method is implemented in ABACUS with both plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbital basis. We benchmark the iron (Fe) systems and analyze differences from calculations with the plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbitals basis in describing magnetic energy barriers. Based on an automated workflow composed of first-principles calculations, magnetic model, active learning, and dynamics simulation, more than 30,000 first-principles data with the information of magnetic torque are generated to train a deep-learning-based magnetic model DeePSPIN for the Fe system. By utilizing the model in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we successfully predict Curie temperatures of alpha-Fe close to experimental values."

      "summary": "Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (sDCs). In this study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of non-zero sDCs. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, particles will eventually reach the boundary with probability one, and that diffusion with a sDC exhibits higher transport efficiency in an early arrival of particles at the boundary than would be expected under diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average (EA) of the sDC. When particles begin to reach an absorbing boundary before the change in a sDC occurs, diffusion with a sDC with a larger supremum exhibits a more efficient transport in an early arrival of particles at the boundary even if the EAs of sDCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, the mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach an absorbing boundary, higher transport efficiency in an early arrival at the boundary almost disappears and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the EA and the convergence speed is determined by the time scale of fluctuations in the DC. We finally discuss the similarities and differences of FPT properties between three-dimensional diffusion outside a spherical absorbing boundary and the one-dimensional diffusion. Our results indicate that fluctuations in DCs may need to be non-Markov and/or non-ergodic to allow efficient transport of particles to distant targets. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role, for example, in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology."

      "summary": "Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD (Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Distillation), which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems, such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences."

      "summary": "Altermagnets, which exhibit the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, have attracted significant attention recently. Among them, ruthenium dioxide (RuO2), a prototypical altermagnet candidate, is under intensive debate on its magnetic order and altermagnetic characters. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial RuO2 thin films with various orientations and fabrication methods. By utilizing thermal spin injections from a ferrimagnetic insulator, we unambiguously reveal a negative spin Hall angle for RuO2, which is opposite to all the previous reports using ferromagnetic metals. Most importantly, we observe robust anisotropic spin-to-charge conversion in RuO2, with voltage ratios of 30% for the (100)- and (110)-orientations and 40% for the (101)-orientations. The ratio remains consistent across RuO2 films fabricated by sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and molecular-beam epitaxy. These results conclusively show a robust and anisotropic spin Hall effect in RuO2 with the absence of altermagnetic spin-splitting contributions. Our study provides crucial insights and advances the understanding of spin-to-charge conversions in emerging materials with low crystal symmetries."

We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of $5\\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.8\\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and HR-EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is modeled by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The HR-EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. The kink in the plot of the autocorrelation function allows a robust and accurate determination of the screening distance without making any simulation or fit. Screening distances of 2 $\\mu$m and 0.3 $\\mu$m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the HR-EBSD measurements is observed and quantified. In this version, an error in the processing of the HR-EBSD maps of the Si wafer is specified."

Furthermore, we account for and track: the interface speed of the pressure driven phase transformation, properties of critical nuclei, as well as nucleation at grain sites and on dislocations and homogeneous nucleation. The volume fraction evolution of each phase is described by employing KJMA (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl, 1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) kinetic theory. We then test our new model for iron under ramp loading conditions and compare our predictions for the $\\alpha\\to\\epsilon$ iron phase transition to experimental data of Smith et al. (2013). More than one combination of material and model parameters (such as dislocation density and interface speed) led to good agreement of our simulations to the experimental data, thus highlighting the importance of having accurate characterization data for the microstructure of the sample under consideration."

Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \\emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport."

      "summary": "Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter interactions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands and nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely connected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic modeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally quite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial Spectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full photon-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor components into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures symmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of crystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed using first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for efficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical conductivities. Our framework opens new avenues for rational data-driven design of anisotropic optical responses for accelerating materials discovery for advancing optoelectronic applications."

The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass we determine that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at intermediate phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. We estimate the transition temperature, determining that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures."

      "summary": "Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density parameters $r_{\\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation (FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function, correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$ (harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches $\\epsilon_{\\rm c}(r_{\\rm s})= - \\pi^2/360 \\sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys. Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$ (infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well), and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $\\epsilon_{\\rm c} \\sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static structure factor at $k=2k_{\\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA."

However, precise experimental data are scarce due to the complexity of experiments, while high-fidelity density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain computationally expensive for large-scale material screening. Machine learning models trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative but face challenges such as functional dependency and limited high-fidelity labelled data. Herein, we present DOS Transformer for Adsorption (DOTA), a functional-independent deep learning model established on the map between local density of states (LDOS) and adsorption energy. DOTA integrates multi-head self-attention mechanisms with LDOS feature engineering to capture latent orbital interaction patterns, enabling it to unify multi-fidelity and multi-source data. This minimises the demand for high-fidelity training data. Consequently, the predictive adsorption energy could reach chemical accuracy, requiring less than five high-fidelity experimental adsorption energies for model training. DOTA also resolves long-standing challenges, such as the \"CO puzzle\", and outperforms traditional theories, including the d-band centre and Fermi softness models. It provides a robust framework for efficient catalyst and electrode screening, bridging the gap between computational and experimental data."

We reveal the emergence of a soft collective mode (Josephson plasmon) at the time-reversal breaking transition, which can be tuned by temperature, twist angle or magnetic field. Furthermore, nonlinear dynamical responses contain direct signatures of both the transition and the broken symmetry itself. In particular, we show that the generation of a second harmonic voltage under alternating current driving is a necessary and sufficient signature of time-reversal symmetry breaking. Finally, we demonstrate that strong nonlinear driving induces dynamical phase transitions between phases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking, introducing a tool for their out-of-equilibrium control. We discuss the signatures of our predictions in AC current-driven experiments on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ interfaces."

Furthermore, we detect resistance modulation under resonance conditions, suggesting that CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 is sensitive to the out-of-the plane spin polarization.

Two inequivalent Al sites, Al(1) and Al(2), are unambiguously assigned by comparing measured nuclear quadrupole parameters with electric field gradients obtained from electronic structure calculations. Knight shift analysis yields distinct hyperfine coupling constants, revealing that they arise predominantly from RKKY-type transferred hyperfine fields through conduction electrons. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal pronounced anisotropic spin fluctuations, and comparison of the relaxation rates between the two Al sites clarifies the momentum-space structure of these fluctuations. At low magnetic fields, $(T_1T)^{-1}$ is strongly enhanced on cooling toward the N\\'eel temperature, indicating the growth of in-plane antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state."

      "summary": "Magnetic inertial dynamics has recently been predicted and experimentally demonstrated in two-sublattice ferromagnets such as CoFeB and NiFe permalloy. In this work, we investigate the spin-wave spectrum of such systems by incorporating the complete magnetic inertia tensor. By decomposing the tensor into symmetric and antisymmetric components, we identify isotropic, anisotropic, and chiral contributions to magnetic inertia. Within linear spin-wave theory, we find that the spectrum comprises two precessional and two inertial magnon bands. Remarkably, the upper precessional band intersects the lower inertial band within the Brillouin zone. Both cross-sublattice and chiral components of the inertia tensor act as effective control parameters for tuning these magnonic band structures. Furthermore, we show that the inertial spin-wave spectrum becomes nonreciprocal along propagation directions where the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is finite. Strikingly, a similar nonreciprocity can also arise purely from chiral inertia, even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our findings establish magnetic inertia as a new pathway to engineer nonreciprocal magnon transport and ultrafast spintronic functionalities."

In this model, competition of particles over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. We show that, in its spatially extended form, this many-particle model exhibits hyperuniform density fluctuations. Through explicit coarse-graining, we develop a hydrodynamic theory that conforms closely with the results of stochastic simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, hyperuniformity arises from the divergence of the interaction range as the system approaches the critical point. These findings may find applications in engineering, cellular population dynamics, and ecology."

      "summary": "Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation."

The Sc component accurately reproduces cohesive energy, lattice constants, defect energetics, and the experimental melting point obtained from two-phase coexistence, demonstrating reliable description of both hcp and liquid phases. The Al--Sc binary interaction parameters were fitted using the L1$_2$--Al$_3$Sc reference and benchmarked against first-principles and calorimetric data. The potential reproduces the strong negative formation enthalpy of Al$_3$Sc (--0.45~eV~atom$^{-1}$), correct relative stability of competing phases, and realistic elastic properties. Mixing enthalpies of the liquid alloy agree with ideal-associated-solution and CALPHAD models, confirming that the potential captures exothermic Al--Sc association in the melt. Molecular-dynamics simulations of solidification reveal the expected temperature and composition dependence of homogeneous nucleation. Pure Al crystallizes readily, while Al--1~at.\\%~Sc exhibits a longer incubation and slower growth at the same absolute temperature due to reduced undercooling and solute drag. Within the alloy, ordered Al$_3$Sc-type L1$_2$ embryos appear spontaneously, with Sc atoms occupying cube-corner (B) sites surrounded by twelve Al neighbors. Energy--volume trajectories confirm that the potential links thermodynamics to microstructural evolution. Overall, the developed 2NN--MEAM potential provides a quantitatively grounded basis for modeling melting, solidification, and intermetallic ordering in Sc and Al--Sc systems, enabling future multicomponent alloy design and large-scale nucleation studies."

      "summary": "Whether a zero-moment antiferromagnet can host an intrinsic half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface remains an open question in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Existing proposals in compensated magnets reach only transport analogues of this limit and do not realize a genuine AFM half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface. Here we show that in two-dimensional altermagnets the N\\'eel-vector orientation acts as an intrinsic knob for magnetic-space-group reduction that lifts the degeneracy between spin sectors. Using Janus monolayer Ta$_2$TeSeO as a realistic and clean platform and combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that rotating the N\\'eel vector first breaks the relevant mirror symmetry, opening a gap in one spin sector of symmetry-related Weyl pairs, and then breaks the residual $C_{2z}$ symmetry, shifting the remaining Weyl cones in opposite energy directions so that a single spin sector retains a Fermi surface at the Fermi level. These two symmetry-lowering steps convert a compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetal into an intrinsic AFM half-metal. The nearly degenerate in-plane magnetic anisotropy then enables reversible switching between the two spin channels using minute strain or weak anisotropic fields. Because this mechanism relies solely on N\\'eel-vector-induced symmetry reduction, it provides a general low-power route to intrinsic half-metallicity in compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetals."

We begin with a mechanical analysis of a one-dimensional three-particle system, which provides a concrete setting in which macroscopic irreversibility emerges despite microscopically reversible dynamics. By abstracting this mechanism, we show that the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the macroscopic level arises solely from the non-injective nature of coarse-graining maps. We then formalize this principle in classical mechanics and prove a general noncommutativity theorem: a reversible microscopic time-reversal map T does not commute with a coarse-graining map $\\varphi$ whenever $\\varphi$ is non-injective. The same mathematical structure extends naturally to quantum mechanics. Using density matrices, anti-unitary time reversal, and CPTP coarse-graining maps, we derive the quantum analogue of the theorem and demonstrate that macroscopic time asymmetry follows inevitably from information loss, without requiring any asymmetry in the underlying microscopic laws. Thus, classical and quantum mechanics share a common mathematical origin of the arrow of time: the loss of microscopic information inherent in coarse-graining."

      "summary": "Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected. In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes. In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes."

We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions."

Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations."

Here, we show that thin film Bi2Se3/n-p (p-n) molecular diodes form ordered interfaces where charge transfer and orbital re-hybridisation result in a decrease (increase) of the carrier density and improved mobility. In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points. Raman spectroscopy gives evidence that the coupling effect may be controlled by optical irradiation, opening a pathway towards the design of heavy-light element hybrids with optically tunable quantum transport."

Discussing the absence of PDM in the bulk where both glide and screw symmetry are present, we argue that the absence of glide symmetry on the surface allows nematic order to selectively stabilize the PDM in thin flakes. Finally, we discuss the symmetry constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism, pointing out the opposite glide and screw parities of the order parameters favor a site, rather than a bond-based paring mechanism. This suggests that pairing in iron-based superconductors may be local to the iron atoms, possibly driven by Hunds coupling."

In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators."

      "summary": "The performance of modern light-emitting technologies, from lasers to LEDs, is limited by nonradiative losses, with Auger recombination being the dominant channel at device-relevant carrier densities. Reliable modeling of this process is essential, yet conventional treatments neglect dynamic dielectric effects, limiting the predictive reliability at operating conditions. We develop a general framework that incorporates the frequency-dependent screened Coulomb interaction $W_{00}(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$, computed from low-scaling \\textit{GW}, into both direct and phonon-assisted Auger amplitudes. Demonstrated on orthorhombic $\\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ (band gap $E_g\\approx1.73$ eV) and $\\gamma$-CsSnI$_3$ ($E_g\\approx1.30$ eV), the approach shows that dynamic screening enhances the dielectric response, lowering the room-temperature Auger coefficient by $\\sim$50-60 %. This renormalization shifts the crossover between radiative and nonradiative recombination by nearly a factor of two in carrier density. Dynamic dielectric screening thus emerges as a quantitative determinant of Auger recombination, offering a transferable framework for predictive modeling across polar semiconductors where frequency-independent screening models are inadequate."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We show that a recent proposal for simulating planar hyperbolic lattices with circuit quantum electrodynamics can be extended to accommodate also higher dimensional lattices in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces if one allows for circuits with more than three polygons at each vertex. The quantum dynamics of these circuits, which can be constructed with present-day technology, are governed by effective tight-binding Hamiltonians corresponding to higher-dimensional Kagom\\'{e}-like structures ($n$-dimensional zeolites), which are well known to exhibit strong frustration and flat bands. We analyze the relevant spectra of these systems and derive an exact expression for the fraction of flat-band states. Our results expand considerably the range of non-Euclidean geometry realizations with circuit quantum electrodynamics."

Then an asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries that generalizes the lattice gas model of Katz, Lebowitz, and Spohn (KLS) is introduced and invariance of the one-dimensional Ising measure is proved. The stationary current is computed in explicit form and is shown to exhibit current reversal at some density. Based on the extremal-current principle for one-dimensional driven diffusive systems with one conservation law, the phase diagram for boundary-induced phase transitions is conjectured for this case. There are two extremal-current phases, unlike in the conventional open asymmetric simple exclusion process, which exhibits only one extremal-current phase or the previously considered conventional open KLS model with one or three extremal-current phases."

We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases."

We investigate the conditions required for condensation in dye-filled microcavities, with photon populations created either by driving a transition of the dye, or by coupling the cavity modes to a thermal photon reservoir such as sunlight. We find that the threshold pump temperature, above which condensation appears, is determined by the second law of thermodynamics. The minimum achievable threshold is that of a reversible three-level heat engine, which we show arises in the dye-pumped case, and for pumping of the modes of a two-level cavity. For a many-level cavity condensation occurs at a similar but higher temperature. Our results show that photon condensates can be produced by pumping with incoherent thermal sources, opening possibilities for coherent light generation, energy harvesting, and experimental studies of quantum heat engines."

While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provides a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, yet their applicability is limited by the infamous sign problem. We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \\cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem."

The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) captures how local measurements generate long-range quantum correlations and drive dynamical phase transitions in many-body systems. Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction. We introduce F2, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data. Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47% and depth by 38% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of 10^(-7). These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation"
