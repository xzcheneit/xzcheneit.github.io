Specifically, such a quantity is used to measure the overall dissimilarity between eigen wavefunctions upon traversing all possible matter states, and confirms the phase boundaries through observing the divergences of both TD and its partial derivatives; we clarify its origin and also offer a theoretical explanation. The method is developed to characterize the non-Hermitian topology in a novel way, and shows its generality and effectiveness in 1D non-Hermitian Kitaev systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians under periodic or open boundary conditions, and even generalizable to higher-order topological systems, providing a novel perspective to understand topological physics."

This algorithmic framework is expressed in a discrete setting in an accessible manner for broader quantitative practitioners without loss of generality. At the same time, the common misconceptions of the requirement of visiting all available states in the time-averaged quantities for physical systems and non-existence of an ergodic process are resolved by introducing the distinction between Gibbs-Boltzmann and von Neumann-Birkhoff ergodic regimes. For this purpose, we introduce a new concept which is called sufficiency of sparse visit. We use finite symbolic random sequences as a pedagogical tool in establishing the different approaches for the detection of ergodic regimes of dynamical systems with vector patterns. The simple example system conveys the different attitudes in ergodicity regimes and offers guidance for building computational tools for its algorithmic detection."

This study introduces DiffractGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer model designed to predict atomic structures directly from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. By capturing the intricate relationships between diffraction patterns and crystal structures, DiffractGPT enables fast and accurate inverse design. Trained on thousands of atomic structures and their simulated XRD patterns from the JARVIS-DFT dataset, we evaluate the model across three scenarios: (1) without chemical information, (2) with a list of elements, and (3) with an explicit chemical formula. The results demonstrate that incorporating chemical information significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Additionally, the training process is straightforward and fast, bridging gaps between computational, data science, and experimental communities. This work represents a significant advancement in automating crystal structure determination, offering a robust tool for data-driven materials discovery and design."

In a 3D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator, a quantized $\\pi$ flux traps a pair of 1D helical modes, whereas a trivial insulator hosts none. In this work, we show that in the presence of even-fold rotation symmetry $C_n$, a 3D band insulator features a refined $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of the flux response. Specifically, it can host two distinct types of helical flux-bound modes that are distinguished by their angular momentum. When both types of flux modes coexist, the system is not a strong topological insulator, but a $C_n$-protected topological crystalline insulator. Building on this result, we propose that flux-threaded nanowires of such topological phase provide a natural platform for realizing 1D crystalline topological superconductors with multiple $C_n$-protected Majorana modes."

      "summary": "Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations."

A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation."

Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT) emerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the system-bath coupling strength. We exemplify our findings for the dissipative spin-boson model and further find excellent agreement with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method."

However, in this work, we demonstrate that SOI can be harnessed to implement an arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit (2Q) gate. We consider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are smoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary high-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and waiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially, performing 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization of a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented using static dots. Our findings establish a practical route toward direct implementation of any 2Q gate via spin shuttling, significantly reducing control overhead in scalable quantum computing architectures."

We use an analytic approach to show that the fully spin-polarized state becomes unstable to a metastable spin-polaron when the kinetic frustration $t'/t$ exceeds a critical, dimension-dependent value. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit. Remarkably, this transition remains robust at low but finite hole density, making it accessible in cold-atom and moir\\'e Hubbard platforms under strong interactions. A variational analysis further captures the instability mechanism at finite density via frustration-induced magnon band deformation."

      "summary": "Currently, topological semimetals are being actively investigated from both theoretical and experimental perspectives due to their unique physical properties, including topologically protected states, large magnetoresistivity, and high carrier mobility, which make these materials promising for various applications in electronics. In this work, we present experimental and theoretical studies of the electronic structure and electronic transport in the Weyl semimetal $WTe_2$. Band structure of $WTe_2$ was scrutinized with DFT+U+SOC method showing the semimetallic nature and sensitivity of the structure to the value of U and to changes in the Fermi energy. Our results demonstrate that $WTe_2$ is in a near-compensated state and exhibits an almost quadratic non-saturating magnetoresistivity. It is found that $WTe_2$ violates the classical Kohler's rule, which is attributed to the coexistence of multiple scattering mechanisms and a strong temperature dependence of the current carrier concentration. Analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals three distinct frequencies corresponding to two electron and one hole Fermi surface pockets, which are well reproduced in Fermi surface calculations. Using the Lifshitz-Kosevich formalism, we determined the electronic structure parameters for each Fermi surface pocket. Additionally, we discuss the relationship between the g-factor and the Berry phase extracted from quantum oscillations."

      "summary": "The ability to manipulate polar entities with multiple external fields opens exciting possibilities for emerging functionalities and novel applications in spin systems, photonics, metamaterials, and soft matter. Liquid crystals (LCs), exhibiting both a crystalline structure and liquid fluidity, represent a promising platform for manipulating phases with polar molecular order, notably ferroelectric ones. However, achieving a polar symmetry is challenging with rod-shaped LC molecules, which form predominantly apolar nematic phases. We report an approach in which a geometric lattice confinement of nematic LCs is used to induce planar polar order on the scale of a mesoscopic metamaterial. We confine the nematic LC in a micropillar array, forming topological defect-pillar pairs of elastic dipoles with a free top interface in contact with an immiscible fluid. The resulting dipole lattice configurations can be programmed rheologically by flowing the top fluid and maintained even after flow cessation, a phenomenon attributed to orientational multistability of the dipoles. This multi-memory effect enables the encoding and reconfiguration of directional information. Overall, this research establishes a foundational understanding of topological dipoles under confinement and shear flow, enabling the detection, tracking, and recording of flow profiles and paving the way for future advances in soft matter physics and stimuli-responsive materials."

Prodan, Annales Henri Poincar\\'e 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of synthetic lattices whose Hamiltonians are symmetric under the simply transitive action of a generic discrete group G. We show that these systems naturally realize the generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary discrete gauge groups. The one-body dynamics mimics that of a particle carrying multiple charges, each experiencing a distinct static gauge-field configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup C of G, while the Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the embedding of C in G. We analyze in depth the role of other subgroups in shaping both the lattice geometry and the dynamics. For engineering relevance, we discuss a theorem that constructs all Cayley-crystals for a given abelian gauge group, and we provide two-dimensional examples corresponding to crystals threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Moreover, Cayley-crystals can be realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms."

Temporal and/or spatial averaging over these fluctuations may give the impression of both a wrong periodicity and a false local symmetry. This can happen even below liquid-nitrogen temperature, so that the true nature of the phase might remain undetected. We demonstrate this scenario at the catalytically active Rh(100) surface covered by 1/2 monolayer (ML) of oxygen, using quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED), variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). Using the example of CO adsorption, we show that local symmetry can have a decisive influence on the binding energy and thus the chemical reactivity."

When grown using co-deposition methods that are typically used for compound semiconductor MBE, vdW materials typically show a high density of structural defects including twin or antiphase domains, spiral growth, and pyramidal growth. These defects are caused by the relatively weak film/substrate interaction and/or the poor wettability of typical substrates by many vdW materials. These difficulties can be mitigated using a multi-step growth procedure in which growth stages including nucleation and coalescence can be rigorously controlled, resulting in high-quality deposition of vdW thin films. This article will describe a general recipe for the growth of highly-crystalline wafer-scale vdW thin films by MBE."

For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a ''chiral flux'' phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)$_m$ magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. Further, sufficiently strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets."

      "summary": "Correlated kagome metals host unique electronic states that enable exotic quantum phenomena. In the recently emerged CsCr6Sb6, these manifest through Kondo behavior from localized Cr-3d electrons and unprecedented band flattening near the Fermi level. Yet the intricate interplay among Kondo screening, magnetic frustration, and electronic correlations remains poorly understood-a fundamental gap we address through multifaceted experimental and theoretical approaches. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal electronic correlation-renormalized flat bands and muon spin relaxation study detect short-range magnetic order at TN ~ 80 K. Complementing these findings, density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations identify a coherent-incoherent crossover at TN, with a remarkable restoration of coherence accompanying local moment suppression-an anomalous hallmark of Kondo behavior. Intriguingly, despite strong interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling, the system evades long-range magnetic order due to competing magnetic configurations separated by sub-meV energy differences. These insights establish CsCr6Sb6 as a prototypical platform for investigating dynamical Kondo screening in correlated flat-band systems, opening new avenues to study flat band physics and frustrated magnetism in correlated kagome lattices."

      "summary": "Topological quasiparticles, arising when the chemical potential is near the band crossing, are pivotal for the development of next-generation quantum devices. They are expected to exist in half-Heusler correlated topological semimetals. However, the emergence of hole carriers, which alter the chemical potential away from the quadratic-band-touching points is not yet understood. Here, we investigated the electronic structure of YPtBi and GdPtBi through ab initio many-body perturbation GW theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory and revealed that the correlation effects of 4$d$ or 4$f$ electrons can lead to the formation of hole carriers. In YPtBi, the weakly correlated Y-4$d$ electrons constitute the topological bands, and the quadratic-band-touching point is at the Fermi level at high temperatures. At low temperatures, enhanced correlations of Y-4$d$ renormalize the topological bands, leading to the formation of hole pocket. In GdPtBi, the strongly correlated Gd-4$f$ electrons form the Hubbard-like bands originate from self-energy effects associated with a topological singularity. These local bands encompass itinerant 4$f$ bands, which hybridize with topological bands to induce pronounced hole bands. This concerted effect reduces the hole doping, bringing the chemical potential closer to the quadratic-band-touching points as the temperature is lowered. The temperature-induced Lifshitz transition should be responsible for the large hole bands observed in both topological semimetals in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements at low temperatures. Our findings indicate that the integration of correlated fermions within a topological framework can modulate the energy landscape of topological bands."

      "summary": "Fully-compensated ferrimagnet has garnered widespread attention due to its zero-net total magnetic moment and non-relativistic global spin splitting. In general, for a fully-compensated ferrimagnet, at least one spin channel should be gapped to ensure a zero-net total magnetic moment, which would lead to a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic semiconductor or half-metal, and appears to limit the existence of a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal. Here, we propose to start with a spin-degenerate two-dimensional antiferromagnetic metal with spin-layer locking and achieve a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Using first-principles calculations, we have validated our proposal by taking monolayer $\\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ as an example. Without considering spin-orbit coupling (SOC), monolayer $\\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ indeed has a zero-net total magnetic moment, exhibits spin splitting, and is metallic within a reasonable range of electric field strength. Therefore, monolayer $\\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ under an applied electric field can indeed become a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal. When SOC is included, the application of an electric field can induce an asymmetric band structure. Our work offers an alternative route to realize the originally forbidden fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal, paving the way for further exploration of fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal."

Here we present a momentum-resolved relaxation time framework that integrates density functional theory with the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation to predict size-dependent resistivity in metallic thin films. Electron phonon interactions are computed from first principles, and anisotropic surface and grain boundary scattering is captured through a momentum dependent mean free path, allowing relaxation times to vary spatially and directionally without empirical fitting. Applied to isotropic (Cu, Ag, Au) and anisotropic (W, Ti$_2$GeC) metals, the model achieves excellent agreement with experiments and uncovers the critical role of crystallographic anisotropy in transport. We further identify layered MAX phase compounds as promising ultrathin interconnects. This work provides a predictive, physically rigorous, and computationally efficient route to designing high-performance conductors for next generation nanoelectronics."

Combining STEM-EELS, and XPS characterizations with DFT calculations, we reveal the leaching of $(PO_4)^{3+}$ and $Al^{3+}$ ions from the $Li_{1.3}Al_{0.3}Ti_{1.7}(PO_4)_3$ (LATP) solid electrolyte upon battery discharge, caused by the highly alkaline environment. Upon charging, the leached ions precipitate as $Li_3PO_4$ and $AlPO_4$, which accumulate on the LATP surface and contribute to battery degradation. A Ti-rich layer is observed at the surface after a few cycles due to depletion of other cations. Our findings suggest that the degradation products are formed through repeated dissolution and precipitation in the discharge-charge cycles. Furthermore, our results indicate that the Ti-rich layer on the LATP surface can potentially reduce parasitic reactions. Our study provides mechanistic understanding of LATP solid electrolyte degradation in humidified Li-$O_2$ cell, paving the way for designing more durable and efficient Li-$O_2$ batteries."

Molybdenum disulfide is the most studied and applied TMD solid lubricant, but other members may have similar or even better sliding properties. Tungsten diselenide is one of the materials that has rarely been investigated in terms of tribological properties. This paper provides a comprehensive tribological characterization of substoichiometric tungsten diselenide and molybdenum disulfide coatings deposited by magnetron sputtering. We focused on tribological properties at a macroscopic scale, particularly friction and wear dependence on applied load; however, a nanoscale frictional assessment of worn surfaces was performed as well to identify the major wear mechanisms. Substoichiometric tungsten diselenide outperformed traditional molybdenum disulfide, exhibiting much lower friction in humid air, suggesting lower coating sensitivity to the humid atmosphere. Moreover, a combination of nanotribological experiments in the wear tracks with sliding under different environmental conditions suggests that the key factor causing frictional load-dependence (deviation from Amonton's law) is frictional heating of the surface."

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and Rietveld refinements indicate that crystalline water resides between the cobalt-based honeycomb layers. This insertion of neutral molecules significantly alters the crystal structure, increasing the interlayer spacing and modifying the local bonding environment. Magnetization measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_N \\sim 17.2$ K, accompanied by a discernible weak ferromagnetic component. The application of moderate magnetic fields induces a spin-flop reorientation at $\\mu_0H \\sim 5.7$ T. The $\\lambda$-type anomaly and long-range order persist up to 9 T, showing the reconfiguration of the ground state as opposed to its suppression. Heat-capacity analysis reveals the full $2R\\ln2$ magnetic entropy expected for two $J_{\\rm eff} = 1/2$ moments per formula unit, confirming the pseudospin description. These findings demonstrate that water intercalation is a robust strategy for tuning the magnetic properties of honeycomb lattice materials.

      "summary": "Unlike conventional magnetic states, which lack degeneracy, the spiral spin liquid (SSL) fluctuates among degenerate spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space. At low temperatures, the field-induced crossover from the polarized ferromagnetic state to the SSL results in a large entropy increase and decalescence, indicating its potential for magnetic cooling. However, magnetic cooling using a SSL has yet to be reported. Here, we investigate the magnetocaloric effect and cooling performance of single-crystal GdZnPO, a spin-7/2 honeycomb-lattice SSL candidate, under a magnetic field $H$ $<$ $H_\\mathrm{c}$ ($\\mu_0H_\\mathrm{c}$ $\\sim$ 12 T) applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane and below the crossover temperature ($\\sim$2 K). For $H$ $\\geq$ $H_\\mathrm{c}$, GdZnPO enters a polarized non-degenerate ferromagnetic state. Our results demonstrate that GdZnPO exhibits a giant low-temperature magnetocaloric effect near $H_\\mathrm{c}$, surpassing other magnetocaloric materials. This giant magnetocaloric effect is well-explained by the frustrated honeycomb spin model of GdZnPO, suggesting the stability of the SSL below $H_\\mathrm{c}$ down to very low temperatures. Additionally, its magnetic cooling performance remains robust up to at least 4.5 K, making GdZnPO a promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration down to $\\sim$36 mK through cycling the applied magnetic field within a narrow range."

However, a comprehensive understanding of the magnon influence has yet to be realized and remains an active research area. The most significant roadblock has been a lack of available materials in which these three quasiparticles can be clearly identified and quantitatively examined in order to provide an intrinsic understanding, not only of their independent contributions to thermal conductivity but also of the cross-correlated interactions among them. Itinerant antiferromagnetic (AFM) BaMn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ with PT symmetry exhibits Anderson metal-insulator localization, which can be tuned into the metallic regime via an applied magnetic field due to its unique electron-magnon interactions. We identify itinerant AFM BaMn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ as an ideal material for scientific investigations into how these quasiparticles participate in thermal conductivity. Here, we present the direct contribution of electrons, phonons, and magnons to thermal conductivity, as well as their interspecies interactions, supported by detailed analyses conducted in the framework of the Boltzmann transport formalism. The comparison of the magneto-thermal conductivity and magneto-electrical conductivity, as well as the magneto-Seebeck effect of itinerant antiferromagnetic BaMn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$, gives unique insight into how magnons participate in longitudinal thermal-associated phenomena."

Furthermore, we establish a direct connection between the strength and sign of the spontaneous Nernst coefficient and the itinerant contribution to orbital angular momentum density arising from the Bloch bands. Finally we construct a rigid two-bands model to evaluate the thermoelectric coefficients by which we find a good agreement with the signs and orders of magnitude of the experimental coefficients of magnetic 3d transition metal ferromagnets. We finally propose some practical recipes for maximizing the spontaneous Nernst effect through electronic band structure tailoring."

      "summary": "The difficult intercalation of sodium (Na) into graphite is studied by systematic and long-time investigations (of up to 2 years) using highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). By studying chemical insertion of solid, liquid and gaseous Na at low and high temperatures (LT, HT) as well as using electrochemical insertion at 25 degree Celsius into uncoated and coated HOPG, it became clear that insertion equilibrium requires HT. On decreasing chemical intercalation temperature from HT (500 degree Celsius) to LT (25 degree Celsius), thermodynamic control was found to change to diffusion control and finally to interfacial control. For the electrochemical insertion, coating (TiO2) proved advisable (to avoid co-intercalation) and efficient in reducing the interfacial resistance. Measured saturation values were found to be not higher than about 1 mol %. Towards room temperature higher equilibrium values cannot be excluded but would in view of the very low driving force kinetically be very difficult to reach. The reversible cell voltage of the saturated composition (versus alkali metal) is distinctly lower than for the analogous cells using lithium (Li) or potassium (K). Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies reveal the unexpected fact that at HT Na predominantly enters HOPG in the form of two-sided intercalation sandwiching carbon layers (bilayers), while at LT more highly aggregated layers appear to a comparable degree, accompanied with the formation of higher-dimensional crystal imperfections. The reasons for this peculiar feature and the non-monotonic thermodynamics in the sequence Li-Na-K-Rb-Cs are discussed not only from an energetic but also from an entropic point of view."

The framework is uniquely appealing due to its ease of automation, its suitability for iterative learning, and its independence from prior knowledge of stable phases, avoiding bias towards pre-existing structural data. The approach uses Nested Sampling (NS) to explore the configuration space and generate thermodynamically relevant configurations, forming the database which undergoes ab-initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) evaluation. We use the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) architecture to fit a model on the resulting database. To demonstrate the efficiency of the framework, we apply it to magnesium, developing a model capable of accurately describing behaviour across pressure and temperature ranges of 0-600 GPa and 0-8000 K, respectively. We benchmark the model's performance by calculating phonon spectra and elastic constants, as well as the pressure-temperature phase diagram within this region. The results showcase the power of the framework to produce robust MLIPs while maintaining transferability and generality, for reduced computational cost."

      "summary": "Surface charging is a ubiquitous phenomenon with important consequences. On one hand, surface charging underpins emerging technologies such as triboelectric nanogenerators; on the other, uncontrolled charging can damage delicate nanostructures and devices. Despite its significance, surface charging by evaporating water droplets remains poorly understood. Here, using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, we spatially resolve the surface-charge patterns from evaporating droplets and propose a physical model that quantitatively explains the origin of bipolar charging."

      "summary": "Cuprate superconductors show various collective charge correlations that are intimately connected with their electronic properties. In particular, charge order in the form of an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) order with an in-plane wavevector $\\delta_{\\text{CDW}} \\approx $ 0.23--0.35~r.l.u. appears to be universally present. In addition to CDW, dynamic charge density fluctuations (CDF) are also present with wavevectors comparable to $\\delta_{\\text{CDW}}$. CDFs are present up to $\\sim300\\;$K and have relatively short correlation lengths of $\\xi \\sim 20$\\;\\AA. Here we use Cu-$L_3$ and O-$K$ resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to study the doping dependence of CDW and CDFs in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. We fit our data with (quasi)elastic peaks resulting from the CDW and up to four inelastic modes associated with oxygen phonons that can be strongly coupled to the CDFs. Our analysis allows us to separate the charge correlations into three components: the CDW with wavevector $\\delta_{4a-\\text{CDW}} \\approx 0.24$ and two CDF components with $\\delta_{4a-\\text{CDF}} \\approx 0.24$ and $\\delta_{3a-\\text{CDF}} \\approx 0.30$. We find that for $T \\approx T_c$ the CDW coexists with the CDFs for dopings near $x=p \\sim 1/8$. The $4a$-CDW disappears beyond $x=0.16$ and the $4a$-CDF beyond $x=0.19$, leaving only a weak $3a$-CDF at the highest doping studied, $x=0.22$. Our data suggest that low-energy charge fluctuations exist up to doping $x=0.19=p^{\\star}$, where the pseudogap disappears, however, we find no evidence that they are associated with a quantum critical point."

In these endeavors, the use of epitaxial graphene may bring significant advantages due to its superiority over the exfoliated counterpart and natural integration with the substrate but the problem of attaining magnetism persists. Here, we report synthesis and analysis of a heterostructure coupling epitaxial graphene with a regular lattice of magnetic atoms formed by Eu intercalation. The magnetization measurements reveal easy-plane 2D magnetism in the material, with the transition temperature controlled by low magnetic fields.

In the paramagnetic phase, the magnetoresistance in graphene exhibits critical exponential behavior of the induced magnetic state. The intercalation does not compromise the parental electronic structure - quantum oscillations in the resistivity manifest low-mass carriers in graphene. The results are set against those for an isostructural material based on intercalated nonmagnetic Sr. Overall, the study expands the family of 2D magnets and establishes a prospective material for graphene-based spintronics."

One example is the formation of interlayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. The integration of 2D sliding ferroelectric materials introduces new opportunities for manipulating excitonic properties in these systems. In this work, we investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body calculations. Photoluminescence spectroscopy at low temperature reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric environment changes. Additionally, local variations in photoluminescence energy correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton behavior. Gate voltage experiments further demonstrate tunable shifts in interlayer exciton energy, driven by switching ferroelectric domains. These results highlight the potential of interlayer excitons being controlled by local ferroelectric polarization and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures."

      "summary": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used as drug carriers in cancer therapy due to their ability to accumulate in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, their transport within tumors is often hindered by the dense extracellular matrix, where diffusion dominates. Several studies suggest that ultrasound (US) irradiation can enhance NP diffusion in ECM-mimicking hydrogels, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, and experimental findings are often contradictory. Here, we use coarse-grained Langevin Dynamics simulations to investigate the conditions under which US can enhance NP diffusion in hydrogels. After validating our simulation framework against an exact analytical solution for NP motion under US in dilute buffer, we systematically explore NP diffusion in hydrogels with varying degrees of NP-network attraction. Our results reveal that acoustic enhancement arises from reduced contact time between NPs and the hydrogel matrix. This effect becomes significant only when NP-hydrogel interactions are sufficiently strong and US pulses are long enough to disrupt these interactions, following a \"stick-and-release\" mechanism. These findings reconcile previously conflicting experimental observations and explain why acoustic enhancement is observed in some studies but not others. Overall, our study provides a molecular-level explanation for US-enhanced NP diffusion in hydrogels and establishes design principles for optimizing therapeutic US protocols in drug delivery applications."

      "summary": "Transition metal oxides belong to a genre of quantum materials essential for the exploration of theoretical methods for quantifying electronic correlation. Finding an efficient and accurate first principles method for the assertion of such physical properties is momentous for the predictive modelling of physics based thermoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Prior investigations have suggested that incorporation of the so called random phase approximation for the electronic screening interaction by adding up the electron hole pairs leads to significant improvement in the accuracy of first principle calculations. Nonetheless the method has seldom been adapted systematically for studying the properties of prototypical transition metal oxides, particularly that of the correlated compound Iron monoxide. In this work, we provide a benchmarking study of a variety of first principles methods such as the density functional theory artificially stabilized by Coulomb interactions, Hybrid functionals as well as the quasiparticle Greens function approach to self-energy interactions. A rigorous convergence of the self-consistent Dysons equations have been provided addressing the importance of initial choice of wavefunctions guided by first principles on the converged solutions and the interplay of various orbital degrees of freedom adjacent to the Fermi level. It is momentous to obtain accurate wavefunctions and many-electronic energy states for the quantification of correlation and efficient modelling of oxide interfaces for quantum applications. The study establishes the hybrid functional scheme as the optimal approach for the ideal trade-off between accuracy of the ground state wavefunctions and computational efficiency for large-scale simulations towards the efficient convergence of correlated electronic wavefunctions and low energy electronic properties."

Designed for transparency and modularity, the device integrates mechanical simplicity, dual feedback control, and real-time synchronization of rheological and optical data, thereby enabling simultaneous investigation of macroscopic mechanical response and microscopic structural dynamics across a wide range of soft matter systems. ShearView is primarily constructed from off-the-shelf components and operated via custom LabVIEW software. Calibration procedures and feedback algorithms allow for the accurate application of arbitrary stress or strain waveforms in both linear and nonlinear regimes. We validate the instrument against a commercial rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 702e), demonstrating excellent agreement in frequency sweeps performed in the linear viscoelastic regime and large-amplitude oscillatory shear for the materials and frequency ranges tested here. In addition, we implement non-standard rheological protocols such as chirped oscillations and recovery rheology. We further illustrate the system capabilities through synchronized imaging during echo and shear-cessation protocols, highlighting its potential to link bulk rheological response with underlying microscopic dynamics. All hardware designs, control software, and example datasets are freely available to facilitate reuse, customization, and educational deployment."

      "summary": "Copper-based chalcopyrite semiconductors have attracted sustained interest owing to their promising thermoelectric (TE) performance, yet the microscopic origins of their TE behavior remain incompletely understood. Here, we systematically investigate the TE properties of Cu$MX_2$ ($M=$ Al, Ga, and In; $X=$ S, Se, and Te) using first-principles calculations. For $p$-type doping, the calculated electrical conductivities ($\\sigma$), hole mobilities ($\\mu$), Seebeck coefficients ($S$), and power factors (PFs) of CuGaTe$_2$ and CuInTe$_2$ show excellent agreement with experimental data. At fixed temperature and hole concentration, as $X$ varies from S to Te, the hole mobility increases markedly due to progressively weaker polar--optical--phonon scattering, reflecting the reduced ionic contribution to the dielectric response in compounds with heavier chalcogens. Combined with smaller transport effective masses, Cu$M$Te$_2$ compounds therefore exhibit high $\\sigma$ and large PFs. Across the Cu$MX_2$ family, the anomalously lower $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ of Cu$M$Se$_2$ relative to Cu$M$Te$_2$ arises primarily from enhanced three-phonon scattering at low-frequency region. For a given $M$, Cu$M$S$_2$ displays the steepest temperature-induced decrease in $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and attains a smaller $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ than Cu$M$Se$_2$ and Cu$M$Te$_2$ at 800~K. Given the low band degeneracy and comparatively modest hole mobilities of Cu$MX_2$ compounds, the most effective routes to further improve their TE performance are to enhance $\\sigma$ and reduce $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ through doping."

High temperature superconductivity above 35 K since 1986 has been a matter of materials science where manipulating the lattice complexity of high temperature superconducting ceramic oxides (HTSC) has driven material scientists to grow new HTSC quantum materials up to 138K in HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8 (Hg1223) at ambient pressure and near room temperature in pressurized hydrides. This perspective covers the major results of materials scientist in these last 39 years investigating the role of lattice inhomogeneity detected in these new quantum complex materials. We highlight the nanoscale heterogeneity in these complex materials and elucidate their special role played in the physics for HTSC. Especially, it is pointed out that the geometry of lattice and charge complex heterogeneity at nanoscale is essential and intrinsic in the mechanism of rising quantum coherence at high temperature"

We observe that a tilt along the quadratic direction can give rise to an energy imbalance between these nodes, contrary to the effect of tilt along the linear direction. We investigate the optical response of such system subjected to an external AC bias, aiming to probe the energy imbalance between the nodes. We show that the anisotropic interband optical conductivity gives a clear signature of imbalanced nodes by exciting electrons at two different chemical potentials at near zero frequency indicating, and the difference between these two chemical potentials is the direct measure of the energy imbalance. Subsequently, we also investigate the intraband DC conductivity by using the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory which reveals that contrary to the tilted Dirac materials, tilt can convert semi-Dirac material from semimetallic phase to metallic phase. Furthermore, we periodically drive the system by external time-periodic perturbation to open up topological gap at those nodes. We also show that the presence of imbalanced Weyl nodes would prevent the SD material from switching to Chern topological phase even after opening topological gaps at the nodes as the bulk remains gapless. Such state cannot be probed by the usual anomalous Hall response as it will be overshadowed by the bulk contribution. Here, we show that those gaps at different chemical potential can be probed by optical excitation."

Unlike Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ > 7$ T and diminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations emerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K. Their amplitude decays exponentially with both temperature and field, specifying dephasing of quantum interference. Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating results in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We attribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely arising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls. The relatively long phase coherence length ($\\sim$ 1.8 $\\mu$m at 0.1 K), estimated from the oscillation amplitude, highlights the potential of complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for exploring quantum interference effects and advancing device concepts in quantum technologies, such as mesoscopic interferometers and quantum sensors."

Depth-resolved Laue micro-diffraction (~10^4 strain sensitivity), nanoindentation, and AFM reveal non-monotonic evolution of lattice strain and hardness: both decrease with temperature up to ~300C, then increase beyond. This turning point reflects a shift from enhanced defect mobility and partial recovery to solute-defect clustering and cavity formation, which stabilize damage. Fe-3%Cr shows consistently higher strain and hardening than Fe-5%Cr, especially at lower temperatures. Minimal change in post-indentation pile-up indicates limited softening or localization. These results highlight how Cr content and temperature jointly affect irradiation response, offering new insights into defect evolution in fusion-relevant alloys."

      "summary": "Fluorescent semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) hold considerable promise for photonics. Furthermore, the optical characteristics of the material can be significantly improved by covalent modification, which generates new spectral features in the near-infrared region and enhances its photoluminescence quantum yield. However, despite the dynamic development of this research domain, the importance of the solvent environment in which the SWCNT functionalization is conducted remains relatively unexplored. In this work, the complex relationships between solvent, dispersant, and SWCNTs were untangled to unravel the underlying phenomena. Through a systematic investigation of SWCNT reactivity in a broad spectrum of solvents, supported by multi-scale modeling enabled by our new implementation of a hybrid functional within SIESTA, we discovered that both the solvent medium and the dispersant enabling SWCNT solubilization affect not only the kinetics but also the course of the covalent modification of SWCNTs. Polar solvents proved to induce significant structural reorganization of polymer molecules on the SWCNT surface and enhance charge redistribution at the polymer-SWCNT interface. Consequently, we achieved a high degree of control over the optical properties of SWCNTs, and the tailored SWCNTs enabled facile optical detection of cholesterol, a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases."

      "summary": "A vanishingly small dielectric function reflects a singular polarization response in a medium, leading to collective plasmonic or polaronic excitations that can enhance Cooper pairing in superconductors via a resonant anti-shielding (RAS) effect. Here, we show that RAS can explain the dramatic enhancement of superconductivity-relative to bulk FeSe, observed in single-unit-cell FeSe films on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and related substrates. Moreover, we present evidence that RAS may play a central role in driving the Cooper pair condensate into a bipolaronic superfluid state. This interpretation aligns with a recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation by Zhang, et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 011010 (2023)], which indicated enhanced bipolaronic superconductivity in two-dimensional systems with moderately strong electron-phonon coupling. RAS may therefore represent a promising strategy for engineering high-T$_c$ superconducting heterostructures."

We propose quantitative design principles for stabilizing hexagonal face-sharing ABX3 perovskites, based on a comparative analysis of oxides and sulfides. By mapping structural preferences across the phase space defined by a unified, electronegativity-corrected tolerance factor and the Shannon A-site radius, we identify distinct thresholds that separate hexagonal phases from competing cubic polymorphs. Our analysis reveals that sulfides differ significantly from oxides due to the increased covalency of transition metal-sulfur bonds, enabling broader compositional flexibility. Applying these principles, we predict a set of thermodynamically stable ABO3 and ABS3 compounds that are likely to adopt face-sharing octahedral connectivity. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing hexagonal perovskites, highlighting sulfides as promising candidates for obtaining quasi-one-dimensional materials having transition metal cations for novel ferroic phenomena."

When the ensemble is flowing, pressure fluctuates around a constant value that does not depend on the crowd size, suggesting that the orifice locally determines the dynamics in this scenario. On the contrary, when the system clogs, pressures are higher for larger crowd sizes, highlighting the importance of the whole collectivity in the process. Then, by correlating the pressure evolution with the exit time of the self-propelled particles, we discover that when a clog is resolved, pressure suddenly drops as a consequence of system reorganization. After this dramatic event, there is a sustained pressure growth over time that shows a square root dependence, compatible with the structural aging that has been proposed to be behind the broad tail distributions of clogging times."

Using top and bottom gate control, together with an interlayer bias, we independently tune the two BLG layers into either the lowest (N = 0) or second (N = 1) Landau level (LL) orbital and probe their interlayer QH states. When both layers occupy the N = 0 orbital, we observe both interlayer exciton condensates (ECs) at integer total filling and interlayer fractional QH states, echoing the results in double monolayer graphene. In contrast to previous studies, however, when both BLG layers occupy the N = 1 orbital, we also observe quantized drag signals, signifying an interlayer exciton condensate formed between the second LLs. By tuning the layer degree of freedom, we find that this N = 1 EC state arises only when the N = 1 wavefunction in each BLG is polarized toward the hBN interface to maximize the interlayer Coulomb interaction."

Essential to describing optical transitions is electron-phonon coupling, which can be predicted from first principles but requires computationally expensive evaluation of all phonon modes in simulation cells containing hundreds of atoms. We demonstrate that this bottleneck can be overcome using machine learning interatomic potentials with negligible accuracy loss. A key finding is that atomic relaxation data from routine first-principles calculations suffice as a dataset for fine-tuning, though additional data can further improve models. The efficiency of this approach enables studies of defect vibrational properties with high-level theory. We fine-tune to hybrid functional calculations to obtain highly accurate spectra, comparing with explicit calculations and experiments for various defects. Notably, we resolve fine details of local vibrational mode coupling in the luminescence spectrum of the T center in Si, a prominent quantum defect."

Despite several theoretical predictions over the past decades, experimental evidence of DQCPs remains elusive. We show that a DQCP can be explored in a system of Rydberg atoms arranged on a triangular lattice and coupled through van der Waals interactions. Specifically, we investigate the nature of the phase transition between two ordered phases at 1/3 and at 2/3 Rydberg excitation density, which were recently probed experimentally in [P. Scholl et al., Nature 595, 233 (2021)]. Using a field-theoretical analysis, we predict both the critical exponents for infinitely long cylinders of increasing circumference and the emergence of a conformal field theory near criticality showing an enlarged U(1) symmetry -- a signature of DQCPs -- and confirm these predictions numerically. Finally, we extend these results to ladder geometries and show how the emergent U(1) symmetry could be probed experimentally using finite tweezer arrays."

In solid-state quantum registers such nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, entangled states are typically created using sequential, pairwise gates between the central electron and individual nuclear qubits. This sequential approach is slow and suffers from crosstalk errors. Here, we demonstrate a parallelized multi-qubit entangling gate to generate a four-qubit GHZ state using a room-temperature NV center in only 14.8 $\\mu$s $-$ 10 times faster than using sequences of two-qubit gates. The entangled states are verified by measuring multiple quantum coherences. Two-qubit entangling gates have an average fidelity of 0.96(1), and the four-qubit parallel gate has a fidelity of 0.92(4), whereas the sequential four-qubit gate fidelity is only 0.69(3). The approach is generalizable to other solid-state platforms, and it lays the foundation for scalable generation and control of entanglement in practical devices."

I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties."

While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamonds (NDs) introduces complexities from size, geometry, and surface effects. NVs in NDs show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and total internal reflection. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated NDs appearing brighter than deeper ones in air and provide a unified framework for realistic emission scenarios. Unlike previous models, our approach predicts wavelength-dependent escape efficiencies and position-dependent variations. This integrated model informs the design of brighter NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale dielectrics."

We start from the quantum simulation of the single-particle quantum walk on the FB and AFB lattices, which are realized by tuning the magnetic flux per plaquette to $\\phi=0$ and $\\phi=\\pi$ respectively. With compressed quantum circuit, we are able to simulate the delocalization in FB lattice and the Aharonov-Bohm caging in AFB lattice. Next, we integrate FB and ABF lattices within a one-dimensional lattice structure and study how these lattices can be utilized to control quantum transport. Moreover, we investigate the effectiveness of a single ABF lattice in controlling the two particles dynamics without and with interaction. We find that the hopping amplitude remains an effective and tunable parameter for controlling particle transport even in the presence of interactions. Our results show that digital quantum simulations of flat-band physics are feasible on current digital NISQ devices through circuit compression. Moreover, this capability enables us to study the potential applications of flat-band systems in quantum control and emerging quantum technologies."

      "summary": "We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science."

Well-resolved hyperfine structure was observed in the luminescence spectra of CaWO4:Ho3+ for the first time. Energies of several crystal-field levels were specified, g-factors were determined. Variations of a magnetic field as small as several tenths of mT can be detected from the PL spectra. We show that the PL spectra are much more sensitive to lattice strains in CaWO4:Ho3+ than the absorption spectra. The spectra were simulated using refined crystal-field parameters and taking into account both hyperfine and deformation interactions. Here, we used the previously obtained distribution function of random strains induced by point lattice defects in an elastically anisotropic CaWO4 crystal. A luminescence thermometer for temperatures around 20 K based on CaWO4:Ho3+ is suggested."

      "summary": "Chiral light-matter interactions have traditionally been understood in terms of electric-magnetic dipolar interference driven by light with spin angular momentum. Here, we show that optical chirality can also originate from the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, giving rise to higher-order multipolar chiral responses. Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused circularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular momenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral dichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes, revealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM. The spectra reveal clear quadrupole resonances whose spectral profile is strongly modulated by the OAM sign, demonstrating an OAM-driven chiral interaction. Crucially, the signal satisfies optical reciprocity, ruling out artefacts from anisotropy or misalignment and confirming its nature as a true chiral response. Angular momentum dissipation analysis further shows that orbital contributions dominate over spin. These findings establish the existence of a distinct form of optical chirality, referred to as orbital optical chirality, which opens new avenues for probing and controlling multipolar chiral light-matter interactions beyond the dipolar paradigm."

      "summary": "With the broad recent research on ferroelectric hafnium oxide for non-volatile memory technology, depolarization effects in HfO2-based ferroelectric devices gained a lot of interest. Understanding the physical mechanisms regulating the retention of these devices provides an excellent opportunity for device optimization both towards non-volatile memory applications and towards real-time signal processing applications in which controlled time constants are of paramount importance. Indeed, we argue that ferroelectric devices, particularly HfO2-based, are an elegant solution to realize possibly arbitrary time constants in a single scaled memory device, which paves the way for temporal and brain-inspired computing in hardware. Here we present a ferroelectric capacitor stack realizing volatile memory due to its unique interface configuration. We provide electrical characterization of the device to motivate its use for realizing time constants in hardware, followed by an investigation of the electronic mechanisms and their possible relation to the observed retention times to facilitate further modeling of the retention process in HfO2-based ferroelectric capacitors. In the presented device, internal electric fields stabilize one polarization of the ferroelectric film, opening the possibility for unipolar operation with millisecond retention for the unstable polarization state. We show a dependence of the retention on both the polarization as well as the electrical stimuli, allowing us to exploit a range of time scales in a single device. Further, the intentionally defective interface in the presented material stack allows an insight into the interplay between retention loss in HfO2-based ferroelectric devices and the internal bias field, which we relate to the interface composition and the role of oxygen vacancies as a possible source of the internal bias fields."

      "summary": "We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable."

In this work we realize topologically non-trivial energy band dispersion of exciton-polaritons confined in two-dimensional anisotropic materials inside an optical microcavity, and show the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) due to non-Hermitian topology arising from excitonic dipole oscillators with finite quasiparticle lifetime. Fourier-plane imaging reveals two pairs of EPs connected by bulk Fermi arcs for each of the transverse electric and magnetic polarized modes. An anisotropic Lorentz oscillator model captures the exact band dispersion observed in our experiment in two-dimensional momentum space. Our findings establish anisotropic two-dimensional materials as a platform for exploring non-Hermitian topological physics, with implications for polarization-controlled optical technologies."

      "summary": "A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently, [Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total $x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code. Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical qubits."

As a result, it is possible to create an instrument capable of realizing all three primary electrical units, but the development of such a system remains challenging. Here we report a unified realization of the volt, ohm, and ampere by integrating a quantum anomalous Hall resistor (QAHR) and a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) in a single cryostat. Our system has a quantum voltage output that ranges from 0.24 mV to 6.5 mV with combined relative uncertainties down to 3 $\\mu$V/V. The QAHR provides a realization of the ohm at zero magnetic field with uncertainties near 1 $\\mu\\Omega$/$\\Omega$. We use the QAHR to convert a longitudinal current to a quantized Hall voltage and then directly compare that against the PJVS to realize the ampere. We determine currents in the range of 9.33 nA to 252 nA, and our lowest uncertainty is 4.3 $\\mu$A/A at 83.9 nA. For other current values, a systematic error that ranges from -10 $\\mu$A/A to -30 $\\mu$A/A is present due to the imperfect isolation of the PJVS microwave bias."

However, the topological order of these states remains hotly debated. Here, we report transport measurements on ultra-clean bilayer graphene heterostructures, where we observed four quarter-filled states and their corresponding Levin-Halperin daughter states, constraining their topological order. Moreover, we complete the sequence of half-filled plateaus by detecting states at v=-3/2 and v=1/2 whose daughters suggest an alternating sequence of non-Abelian orders. This pattern suggests a universal origin supporting their use in identifying topological order at even-denominator fillings, though further confirmation is needed via direct measurements. The observed quarter- and half-filled states appear in N=0 and N=1 Landau levels, respectively, and thus highlight a competition between interactions favoring paired states of either four- or two-flux composite fermions. Additionally, we observe several 'next-generation' quantum Hall states that require strong interactions between composite fermions."

The thermodynamic formalism has become an inspiring framework in the study of smooth dynamical systems, and pioneering works of Helmholtz, Clausius, and Boltzmann have been reinstated as possible dynamical foundations of the (first part of the) Heat Theorem. The present paper follows the work of Wald et al., where black hole entropy was identified as a Noether charge. The adiabatic invariance of the thermodynamic entropy indeed invites a connection with Noether's theorem, and has been the subject of various papers. Here we add the case of GENERIC, a macroscopic dynamics whose acronym stands for ``General Equation for Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling''. Its evolution has two contributions: a dissipative part, which is of a generalized gradient descent form, and a Hamiltonian flow. We consider a quasistatic protocol for external parameters, and we embed GENERIC as the zero-cost flow for a Lagrangian governing the dynamical fluctuations. We find a continuous symmetry of the corresponding path-space action with the thermodynamic entropy as Noether charge, both in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. We make the calculations explicit through the example of an inertial probe with nonlinear friction."

This ambiguity is further emphasized by the rate effects observed in a number of micro/nano-indentation experiments, thus highlighting the need for a more careful investigation of the thermomechanical interactions at such small scales. With this in mind, the present study aims to demonstrate the role of thermomechanical couplings in indentation-induced martensitic transformation in SMAs. To this end, a simple phenomenological model of pseudoelasticity is employed and finite-element simulations are performed to address two key questions. (1) At which spatial and temporal scales do the thermomechanical couplings arising from the latent heat become effective? (2) To what extent do these couplings influence the indentation response? In connection with the latter, our analysis quantifies the maximal thermal effects that emerge during adiabatic indentation and compares them with those of isothermal indentation."

In the absence of random transverse fields, the behavior is dictated by the classical random-field Ising fixed-point. In the simultaneous presence of both a longitudinal and transverse random field, the RG trajectories are attracted to one of the two disordered fixed-points and the relevant scaling direction at the infinite disorder fixed-point is along the separatrix, where the correlation-length is shown to diverge with an exponent $\\nu_h \\approx 1$."

Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\\rm F}$, follow $(1+\\gamma k_{\\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity. The inclusion of the correction linear in $k_{\\rm F}a$ greatly improves the agreement with the recent measurement of the viscosity by the Yale group."

Here, we show that this effect is observed also in homogenous carbon based systems, such as graphene nanoribbons (GNRs): a spatially uniform laser pulse can create strongly localized carrier excitations, including excitons, on the sub-nanometer scale within a few femtoseconds. The origin of this effect is the unusual topological-based electronic structure of the GNRs. This opens new avenues for nanoelectronics and brings petahertz switching within reach. Using nonequilibrium Green functions simulations we demonstrate this effect by exciting small GNR heterostructures of suitable geometry with a laser pulse with carefully chosen photon energy, polarization, and carrier-envelope phase."

We develop a theory for the deformations of a class of twisted non-Euclidean sheets which have a symmetry based on the celebrated Bonnet isometry. We show that non-orientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that orientable ribbons can also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by how the unit normal vector winds around the centerline of the ribbon, and provides conditions for constructing soft modes of deformation compatible with the topology of multiply-twisted connected ribbons."

We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps show quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost scales efficiently with system size, demonstrating the framework's scalability."

Despite growing efforts to find new skyrmion host systems, the microscopic mechanisms leading to skyrmion phase transitions at specific temperatures and magnetic fields remain elusive. Here, we systematically study the isostructural centrosymmetric magnets- GdRu2X2 (X = Si and Ge), and the role of X-p orbitals in modifying magnetic exchange interactions. GdRu2Ge2 single crystals, synthesized by arc melting, exhibit two high-entropy pockets associated with skyrmion phases at 0.9 T < H < 1.2 T and 1.3 T < H < 1.7 T, 2 K < T < 30 K-more accessible condition at lower fields and higher temperatures than that in the Si counterpart. Entropy estimations from heat capacity measurements align with magnetization data, and transport studies confirm a topological Hall effect, highlighting the system's nontrivial spin textures and Berry curvature. Compared to GdRu2Si2, electronic structure and exchange interaction evaluations reveal the more extended Ge-4p orbitals enhance competing exchange interactions in GdRu2Ge2, thereby manifesting the rich skyrmion behavior. This work demonstrates how modifying exchange interactions at the atomic level enables the tunability of topologically nontrivial electronic states while advancing our understanding of skyrmion formation mechanisms for future spintronics."

      "summary": "The computational cost of traditional first-principles method quickly becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of atoms increases. This challenge is further amplified by the need to evaluate finite-temperature properties with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which is inherently challenging to parallelize due to sequential Markov chain updates. Here, we introduce Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC), an efficient MC simulation method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks in conventional MC simulation, reducing the computational complexity of a MC sweep from quadratic to linear. We present a GPU implementation of the SMC method, SMC-GPU, which simultaneously harnesses the thousands of processing cores on a GPU to accelerate the computation. By adopting a data-driven workflow that surrogates the computationally expensive density functional theory (DFT) with ML models, we demonstrate that SMC-GPU is capable of simulating systems of more than one-billion atoms, while maintaining the accuracy of first-principles methods. Using this unprecedented capability, we performed billion-atom MC simulations to investigate the nanostructure evolution of two important high-entropy alloys (HEAs), FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW, in which the nanostructures are believed to be responsible for their superb mechanical properties. Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanostructures, including nanoparticles (NP), 3D-connected NP, and disorder protected nanophases. We quantitatively analyze the size, composition, and morphology of the nanostructures, as well as directly simulate the atom-probe-tomography (APT) needle. The results align well with available experimental observations. This work underscores the promising potential of leveraging large-scale MC simulation to explore the largely uncharted territory of nanostructure evolution in HEAs."

However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices."

A wedged Cu layer is deposited atop the spin valve to tune energy transmission to the magnetic stack for both optical and hot-electron excitation. We demonstrate single shot magnetization reversal of the free layer using hot electron pulses. Moreover, such reversal is achieved even with picosecond laser pulses. The influence of laser fluence, Cu thickness ($t_{\\mathrm{Cu}}$), and pulse duration is investigated in detail. Our results indicate that the key factor enabling magnetization reversal is full demagnetization of the free layer, driven by a rapid rise in its electronic temperature achieved via either direct laser or hot electron excitation. This work advances the understanding of ultrafast magnetization reversal via nonlocal heat and spin transport under strongly out of equilibrium conditions."

Those zeros define the $(d-1)$-manifold of quantum criticality (Fermi surface). Its appearance or restructuring correspond to the Lifshitz transition. Such $(d-1)$-membrane breaks the symmetry of the momentum space, leading to gapless excitations, a hallmark of metallic phase. To probe quantitatively the gapless phase we introduce the geometric order parameter as $d$-volume of the Fermi sea. From analysis of the chain, ladder, and free fermions with different spectra, this proposal is shown to be consistent with scaling near the Lifshitz points of other quantities: correlation length, oscillation wavelength, susceptibilities, and entanglement. All the (hyper)scaling relations are satisfied. Two interacting cases of the Tomonaga-Luttinger ($d=1$) and the Fermi ($d=2,3$) liquids are analysed, yielding the same universality classes as free fermions."

Taking the advantage of the low computation effort of the tight-binding and unfolding approach, it is possible to calculate and analyze the behavior of a variety of the electronic configurations. Our tight-binding model is able to describe not only the behavior of the G-center in the silicon bulk but using the unfolding approach it can also pinpoint the contributions of different elements of the supercell on the final pseudo-band structure. Moreover, the configuration interaction correction with single-particle basis states computed by our unfolded tight-binding model predicts a very small fine-structure splitting of the ground state exciton both for bright and dark doublet in the studied system.

We show that stacking monolayer ferromagnetic topological states into layer-spin-locked bilayer antiferromagnetic structures, and introducing sliding ferroelectricity leads to asynchronous topological evolution of different layers (spins) owing to existence of polarization potentials, thereby giving rise to rich layer-resolved topological phases. As a specific example, by means of a lattice model, we show that a bilayer magnetic 2D second order topological insulator (SOTI) reveals an unrecognized spin-hybrid-order topological insulator after undergoing ferroelectric sliding. Interestingly, in such phase, the spin-up (top layer) and spin-down (bottom layer) channels exhibit first-order and second-order topological properties, respectively. Moreover, other topological phases such as SOTI, quantum spin Hall insulator, quantum anomalous Hall insulator, and trivial insulator can also emerge through changes in the parameters of the system, and the relevant topological indices are also discussed. In terms of materials, based on first principles calculations, we predict material ScI2 can serve as an ideal platform to realize our proposal. Further, we predict that the anomalous Nernst effect of these several topological phases exhibits distinct differences, and therefore can be used as a signal for experimentally probing."

However, the interplay between these two types of order remains relatively unexplored. Here, we address this point by studying crystals of active particles that turn either towards or away from each other, which can be experimentally realised with phoretic or Janus colloids or with elastically-coupled walker robots. We show that, depending on how these interactions vary with interparticle distance, the particles align along directions determined by the underlying crystalline lattice. To explain the results, we map the orientational dynamics of the active crystal onto a lattice of spins that interact via (anti-)ferromagnetic alignment with each other plus nematic alignment with the lattice directions. Our findings indicate that orientational and positional order can be strongly coupled in active crystals, thus suggesting strategies to control orientational order by engineering the underlying crystalline lattice."

      "summary": "The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, has revealed the breakdown of Bloch band theory in non-Hermitian lattices. While one-dimensional non-Hermitian bands are well-described by the non-Bloch band theory, its extension to higher dimensions is challenged by the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates depend on the system's geometry. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a universal theoretical framework based on the strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ). Our framework provides a systematic description of the GDSE, explains its origin through the competition between incompatible SGBZs, and provides for the first time a clear criterion for its emergence. We also unify our SGBZ framework with the Amoeba formulation by showing that the Amoeba spectrum is the superset of all possible SGBZ spectra, thereby clarifying its domain of validity. This work establishes a foundation for studying higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, paving the way for the future investigation of novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics, such as hybrid skin-topological effects and non-Hermitian Chern bands."

      "summary": "Despite recent advances in orbitronics, the influence of disorder on the orbital Hall effect and orbital relaxation mechanisms remains poorly understood. In this work, we numerically investigate the role of disorder in orbital transport within mesoscopic devices using a real-space tight-binding model on a two-dimensional square lattice that hosts atomic orbitals capable of carrying atomic orbital angular momentum. By considering devices with varying geometries--square and rectangular--and systematically tuning disorder strength, we examine the disorder effect on orbital Hall current (OHC) generation, and orbital relaxation. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the OHC and orbital Hall angle on disorder strength. In square devices, we demonstrate that the orbital Hall response can be strongly enhanced by disorder and its dependence on the disorder strength indicates the dominance of skew-scattering mechanism in the diffusive regime. In rectangular geometries, the orbital current decays exponentially with increasing device width, from which the orbital relaxation length is extracted. These findings provide critical insights into disorder-driven orbital transport phenomena and lay the foundation for designing next-generation orbitronic devices."

However, the chemical short range ordering (SRO) and its interplay with local lattice distortion (LD) remain to be explored, although they could diminish the configurational entropy and potentially impact structure property relationships. A combination of experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to investigate the SRO and LD in the prototype ESO, Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O, generally referred to as J14. We demonstrate that the efficiency and accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) relaxed special quasirandom structures (SQS) enhances the analysis of the local structure of J14, unveiling the unique local cationic environments. Importantly, this joint experimental and computational approach sheds light on the understanding of local structure and structure property relationships in J14, demonstrating the necessity for further research into other high entropy and compositionally complex materials."

We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin."

Furthermore, nonlinear dynamical responses contain direct signatures of both the transition and the broken symmetry itself. In particular, we show that second harmonic generation is a necessary and sufficient signature of the symmetry breaking. Finally, we demonstrate that strong nonlinear driving induces dynamical phase transitions between phases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking, introducing a tool for their out-of-equilibrium control. We discuss the signatures of our predictions in AC current-driven experiments on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ interfaces."

We analyze the regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath, using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential."

In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures: $T_c$, marking the onset of thermionic-dominated transport, and $T_t$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann limit scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology."

At short times, the mean squared displacement becomes ballistic, scaling as t^2. This effect was predicted by Einstein in 1907 and recently observed experimentally. We report that this picture is only true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of t^(5/2). This new result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a non-zero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on non-zero initial velocities. These results are a first step towards the unraveling of nonequilibrium dynamics of fluids."

While porous current collectors can suppress dendrite growth, optimal porosity and composition remain unknown. Here, we show that the temperature during vapor phase dealloying (VPD) of alpha-brass (Cu63Zn37) controls the surface Zn concentration, decreasing from 8 percent to below 1 percent from 500 to 800 degrees C. The surface composition is controlled by the temperature-dependent diffusion. A battery cell maintains greater than 90 percent Coulombic efficiency (CE) over 100 cycles when the Zn content is the lowest, whereas the higher-Zn samples degraded to approximately 70 percent CE. The difference in surface composition has hence dramatic effects on battery performance, and our results demonstrate how precise compositional control enables stable lithium-metal battery operation, establishing about 1 atomic percent surface Zn as optimal for preventing capacity fading and uniform lithium plating, while establishing predictive relationships between processing temperature and surface composition. This work provides design rules for multifunctional current collectors and demonstrates scalable VPD production for next-generation batteries."

Closed expressions for transition lines have been obtained, expressed by a linear combination of interaction energies times reciprocal temperatures for the simultaneous thermal contact baths and deviates from it when the contact is not simultaneous. The interplay between performance and dissipation is investigated under different conditions, giving rise to a richness of operation regimes, such as heat-engine and heat pump. The relationship between thermodynamic quantities (power, efficiency and dissipation) allows a careful choice of parameters to ensure the desirable compromise between them.

For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\\leq T \\leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\\leq B \\leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \\leq \\omega/2 \\pi \\leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T > 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons."

In this work I prove an analogous statement: $\\rho= \\sigma^{-1}$, across two different classes of holographic theories related by a generalisation of the electric-magnetic duality in the $D=4+1$ bulk. In terms of the dual hydrodynamic theories, this statement is shown to imply the suppression of any contributions to the transport coefficients from dynamical electromagnetic fields, present in only one of the two theories. This makes the two theories, as far as late-time linear electric transport is concerned, equivalent. I then confirm these findings by considering one specific model and run numerical simulations in different settings."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: In realistic neural circuits, both neurons and synapses are coupled in dynamics with separate time scales. The circuit functions are intimately related to these coupled dynamics. However, it remains challenging to understand the intrinsic properties of the coupled dynamics. Here, we develop the neuron-synapse coupled quasi-potential method to demonstrate how learning induces the qualitative change in macroscopic behaviors of recurrent neural networks. We find that under the Hebbian learning, a large Hebbian strength will alter the nature of the chaos transition, from a continuous type to a discontinuous type, where the onset of chaos requires a smaller synaptic gain compared to the non-plastic counterpart network. In addition, our theory predicts that under feedback and homeostatic learning, the location and type of chaos transition are retained, and only the chaotic fluctuation is adjusted. Our theoretical calculations are supported by numerical simulations."

Using the D3-D5 model of gauge/gravity duality, we investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a relativistic (2+1)-dimensional defect moving at constant velocity within a (3+1)-dimensional heat bath. We find that the dependence of the order parameter on both the heat bath temperature and the defect velocity can be captured by a single variable -- the proper effective temperature -- for the moving defect. Our results suggest that the proper effective temperature is an essential parameter for a class of relativistic non-equilibrium steady states."

However, observations have been hampered by magnetic couplings to excited vibrational and rotational states of polyatomic systems, which are challenging to control, characterize, and systematize. In this work, we carried out deflection measurements on superfluid helium nanodroplets doped with high-spin FeCl2 and CoCl2 molecules and their complexes. This enabled quantitative determination of the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters at extremely low, and fully defined, temperature of all of their degrees of freedom. The spin magnetic moments become thermalized and oriented along the applied field. Dimers and trimers are found to be antiferromagnetically ordered. The issue of rates and mechanisms of molecular spin relaxation within the cryogenic helium matrix is highlighted."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization. Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state has spectral weight on the so-called quantum many-body scar states, which are non-thermalizing eigenstates embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal eigenstates. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems, particular to systems which exhibit scars-induced entanglement oscillations. We exemplify this with the PXP model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between temporally-separated transient states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished) subsystem non-Markovianity. The retention of memory and revivals between transient subsystem states is a finer form of memory effect than captured by the revivals of full system's fidelity with the initial states. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum many-body systems."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science."

A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime."
