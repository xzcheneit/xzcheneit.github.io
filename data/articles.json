First-principles calculations reveal that strain modifies the electronic structure near the Fermi level, influencing both magnetostriction and damping through spin-conserving transitions. The results reproduce experimental trends across alloy compositions and clarify the role of orbital degeneracy. This intrinsic link between magnetization dynamics and magnetoelasticity suggests routes for designing materials with controllable damping for energy-efficient memory and flexible spintronics. [Phys.

      "summary": "A superconducting device is proposed for experimentally investigating whether an Abrikosov vortex can be modeled as a quantum mechanical quasiparticle. The design process of a type-II superconducting device capable of reliably pinning a single Abrikosov vortex is presented, creating a particle-in-a-box-like system. The proposed device consists of a cylindrically symmetric Nb film, 30 nm in diameter and 5 nm thick, with a 14 nm diameter artificial pinning center at its center. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations indicate robust single-vortex pinning under an applied field of 6 T. The presumed quantized energy levels and associated quantum wavefunctions of the vortex quasiparticle are obtained by numerically solving the two-dimensional time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation for this system. It is shown that distinguishing the ground and first excited states is experimentally feasible. Beyond fundamental physics studies, the application of the proposed device in cryogenic memory technology and quantum computing warrant further exploration."

In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$."

These experiments both confirmed the importance of strain in stabilizing the predicted incommensurate Kekul\\'{e} spiral (IKS) order near filling $|\\nu|=2$ of the weakly dispersive central bands in both systems, and suggested a key role for electron-phonon couplings and short-range Coulomb interactions in selecting between various competing orders at low strain in MA-TBG.

This in turn influences the visibility of the IKS order in STM in a manner that allows us to infer their relative importance. We use this insight in conjunction with various other pieces of experimental data to build a more complete picture of the phase diagram, focusing on the spectrum of low-lying collective modes and the nature of the doped Fermi surfaces. We explore the broad phenomenological implications of these results for superconductivity."

      "summary": "Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings."

      "summary": "Establishing a universal diagnostic of topological order remains an open theoretical challenge. In particular, diagnosing long-range entanglement through the entropic area law suffers from spurious contributions, failing to unambiguously identify topological order. Here we devise a protocol based on the ZX calculus, a graphical tensor network, to determine the topological order of a state circumventing entropy calculations. The protocol takes as input real-space bipartitions of a state and returns a ZX contour diagram, $\\mathcal{D}_{\\partial A}$, displaying long-range graph connectivity only for long-range entangled states. We validate the protocol by showing that the contour diagrams of the toric and color codes are equivalent except for the number of non-local nodes, which differentiates their topological order. The number of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state superposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious entropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect topological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of diagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics."

By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across interaction strength \\( J_z \\) and dimerization \\( \\delta \\), we map out their phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \\( J_z \\) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \\( J_z \\) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit."

Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale."

Based on the structural identification of different intermediates, enabled by the contrast in electron microscopy provided by the metal nanoparticles that play the cargo role, we find that multiple cargo encapsulation occurs by self-assembly via a specific ``assembly line'' pathway that is different from previously described \\emph{in vitro} assembly mechanisms of virus-like particles (VLP). The emerging model explains observations that are potentially important for delivery applications, for instance, the pronounced nanoparticle size selectivity."

Here, we introduce a spectral segregation framework that maps distributions of segregation energies for light interstitials in Ni as a function of local Cr coordination. Boron exhibits a broad, rugged energy spectrum with significant positional flexibility whereas carbon remains confined to a narrow spectrum with minimal displacement. At the free surface, Cr-rich coordination destabilizes both interstitials (e.g., positive segregation energies), in sharp contrast to the stabilizing role of Cr at the GB. This inversion establishes a natural segregation gradient that drives interstitials away from undercoordinated internal surfaces and toward GBs. These results underscore the limitations of single-valued segregation descriptors and demonstrate how a distributional approach reveals the mechanistic origins of interstitial--interface interactions in chemically heterogeneous alloys."

However, challenges have remained in designing accurate thermal characteristics based on quasi-ballistic phonon transport. The quasi-ballistic thermal transport arises from the combination of wave-like and diffusive phonon behaviors unlike pure diffusion. The topological nature has been known to be compatible with both wave and diffusive phenomena. Therefore, topological phononic crystals have great potential for the development of controllable and designable thermal transport based on quasi-ballistic phonons. In this study, we experimentally investigated the thermal behavior at the scale of quasi-ballistic phonon transport using a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model-based topological phononic crystal. Quasi-ballistic phonon transport was observed through change in thermal conductivity depending on the structural parameters of topological systems using micro-thermoreflectance. Furthermore, using topological interface states, the experimentally observed thermal behaviors were found to agree well with the theoretically expected those. Accordingly, the topological nature is an effective approach for thermal management in micro- and nanoscale systems with quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results pave the way for a unified control scheme for wave and diffusion phenomena, such as quasi-ballistic phonons."

We show that the transition is unidirectional for individual electrons or holes. They always undergo a delocalization-to-localization transition as the flux increases. In contrast, the transition of the neutral electron-hole pairs is bidirectional. As the flux increases, the transition can be a localization-to-delocalization transition or vice versa, which is controlled via the long-time tail of the voltage pulse. The localization-to-delocalization transition occurs in the case of short-tailed pulses, which decay faster than Lorentzian. In this case, the directions of the transitions for the neutral eh pairs and individual electrons or holes are opposite. Certain localized neutral electron-hole pairs can first evolve into delocalized ones, then split into individual electrons and holes with localized wave functions, which gives a reentrant localization. The delocalization-to-localization transition occurs in the case of long-tailed pulses, which decay slower than Lorentzian. The reentrant localization vanishes in this case, as the directions of the two transitions are the same. It is also absent in the case of Lorentzian pulses, where the localized neutral electron-hole pairs cannot be excited at all."

      "summary": "Laser heating during additive manufacturing (AM) induces extreme and transient thermal conditions which critically influence the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the resulting component. However, accurately resolving these conditions with sufficient spatiotemporal accuracy remains a central challenge. We demonstrate a unique approach that couples high-speed infrared imaging, during selective laser melting of MAR-M247, with a transient three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics simulation to reconstruct the dynamic sub-surface temperature distribution of the melt pool. This integrated framework enables the estimation of experimentally-validated, 3D solidification conditions-including solidification velocities and cooling rates-at the solid-liquid interface while also significantly lowering computational cost. By quantifying solidification conditions, we predict variations in microstructure size and orientation driven by laser processing parameters and validate them with ex situ scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction maps. Our findings substantiate that an integrated experimental-computational approach is crucial to realize in situ prediction and optimization of microstructures in commercial AM."

Then, our recent results of high-pressure infrared studies are described for Mg$_2$Si, InAs, and InSb. For Mg$_2$Si, pressure-induced metallization at pressures near 10 GPa were clearly demonstrated for both carrier-doped and undoped Mg$_2$Si by large increases of reflectivity. For InAs and InSb, their band gap ($E_g$) increased rapidly and almost linearly with pressure with linear coefficients of $dE_g/dP$=84.6 and 112 meV/GPa, respectively. Obtained values of $E_g$ versus lattice parameter at high pressures are compared with those for other IIl-V semiconductors at ambient pressure, giving unique insight into effects of physical and chemical pressures on $E_g$. Above the structural transition pressures of 7 and 3 GPa for InAs and InSb, respectively, they exhibit highly metallic characteristics accompanied by high reflectivity."

      "summary": "In conventional superconductors, the energy scale associated with the superfluid stiffness is much larger compared to the pairing energy and hence, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is entirely dictated by the superconducting (SC) energy gap. The phase rigidity of the SC condensate in unconventional superconductors, on the other hand, can be low enough to enable destruction of superconductivity via phase incoherence and persistence of an energy gap even at the absence of macroscopic superconductivity above Tc. This is considered a possible mechanism of the pseudogap (PG) state of cuprate high temperature superconductors (HTSCs). We have investigated the electronic energy ({\\omega}) and momentum-separation vector (q) dependence of the joint density of states (JDOS), derived from the autocorrelated Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) data, from moderately underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\\delta}HTSC samples at temperatures below and above Tc. We found that q-space structure of the constant {\\omega} JDOS intensity maps and the dispersions of the JDOS peaks are essentially the same both below and above Tc. Furthermore, the dispersions of the JDOS peaks above Tc are particle-hole symmetric. These observations evince similarity between the nature of the energy gap below and above Tc, which supports preformed pairing scenario for the PG state at least in the moderately underdoped regime."

      "summary": "Diffusive motion is a fundamental transport mechanism in physical and biological systems, governing dynamics across a wide range of scales -- from molecular transport to animal foraging. In many complex systems, however, diffusion deviates from classical Brownian behaviour, exhibiting striking phenomena such as Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (BYNGD) and anomalous diffusion. BYNGD describes a frequently observed statistical feature characterised by the coexistence of linear mean-square displacement (MSD) and non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Anomalous diffusion, in contrast, involves a nonlinear time dependence of the MSD and often reflects mechanisms such as trapping, viscoelasticity, heterogeneity, or active processes. Both phenomena challenge the conventional framework based on constant diffusivity and Gaussian statistics. This review focuses the theoretical modelling of such behaviour via the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity (LEFD) -- a flexible stochastic framework that captures essential features of diffusion in heterogeneous media. LEFD not only accounts for BYNGD but also naturally encompasses a wide range of anomalous transport phenomena, including subdiffusion, ageing, and weak ergodicity breaking. Ergodicity is discussed in terms of the correspondence between time and ensemble averages, as well as the trajectory-to-trajectory variability of time-averaged observables. The review further highlights the empirical relevance of LEFD and related models in explaining diverse experimental observations and underscores their value to uncovering the physical mechanisms governing transport in complex systems."

By analyzing the inverse participation ratio and the centroid position of the wave packet, the delocalization-localization phase diagrams in the equilibrium state and the non-equilibrium steady state are obtained respectively. The stability of the system's initial state on dissipation and the dissipation-driven delocalization-localization transition (or vice versa) are discussed. The dynamic evolution behavior provides evidence for the existence of the quantum Mpemba effect in this dissipation-modulated system. A starting-line hypothesis is proposed, which can be used to explain the occurrence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect. In addition, the thermodynamic applications of this system have also been studied. The results prove that the localized phase is beneficial to the realization of quantum heater as well. Our work has promoted the understanding of the steady-state phase transitions and dynamic behaviors of dissipation-modulated quasiperiodic systems, and has expanded the existing thermodynamic research on the application of quasiperiodic systems."

However, their scalable applications are severely constrained by low hole mobility. In this work, we take 2D-GaAs as a prototype of III-V semiconductors to investigate the effects of quantum anharmonicity (QA) on hole transport, employing the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by the machine learning potential. It is found that the room-temperature hole mobility of 2D-GaAs is reduced by $\\sim$44% as the QA effects are incorporated, which is attributed to the enhanced electron-phonon scattering from the out-of-plane acoustic polarization. The valence band edge shift (VBES) strategy is proposed to increase the hole mobility by $\\sim$1600% at room temperature, which can be realized by 1% biaxial compressive strain. The electron-phonon scattering rate is dramatically decreased due to the full filtering of the original interband electron-phonon scattering channels that existed in the flat hole pocket. The VBES strategy can be further extended to other 2D III-V semiconductors to promote their hole mobilities."

In this work, we successfully determine the microscopic information on the superconducting gap structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\\delta$ samples subjected to pressures exceeding 20~GPa, by constructing different conductance junctions within diamond anvil cells. By analyzing the temperature-dependent differential conductance spectra within the Blonder--Tinkham--Klapwijk (BTK) model, we have determined the superconducting energy gap at high pressure. The differential conductance curves reveal a two-gap structure with $\\Delta_{1} = 23~\\mathrm{meV}$ and $\\Delta_{2} = 6~\\mathrm{meV}$, while the BTK fitting is consistent with an $s$-like, two-gap spectrum. The gap ratio $2\\Delta_{s1}(0) / k_{\\mathrm{B}}T_{c}$ is found to be 7.61, belonging to a family of strongly coupled superconductors.

Here, we introduce in situ directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation, differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors. These findings set stringent constraints on theoretical models for nickelate superconductors and establish a robust spectroscopic approach for understanding superconductors under extreme pressures."

In this work, we extend the atomic-scale phase-field methodology by incorporating universal machine learning interatomic potentials, thereby generalizing the free energy functional to many-body systems. This extension enhances both the accuracy and transferability of the approach. We demonstrate the method by applying it to bulk copper under NVT and NPT ensembles, where the predicted pressures and equilibrium lattice constants show excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, validating the theoretical framework. Furthermore, we apply the method to {\\Sigma}5(310)[001] grain boundaries in copper, enabling the visualization of local free energy distributions with atomic-scale resolution. The results reveal a pronounced free energy concentration at the grain boundary core, capturing the thermodynamic signature of the interface.

This derivation is performed near the critical point within the framework of curved spacetime. The novelty of the present work lies in deriving a general Ginzburg-Landau action that depends on spacetime curvature, where the curvature is tuned by an external electric field. Furthermore, this finding enables us to apply the Ginzburg-Landau theory at high temperatures by changing the spacetime metric, potentially offering insights into achieving high-temperature superconductivity in these materials."

In this work, we show that graphene under a magnetic field in the presence of a minimal length has a hidden $su(1,1)$ symmetry. This symmetry allows us to construct the spectrum algebraically. In fact, a generalized uncertainty relation, leading to a non-zero minimum uncertainty on the position, would be closer to physical reality and allow us to control or create bound states in graphene. Using the partition function based on the Epstein zeta function, the thermodynamic properties are well determined. We find that the Dulong-Petit law is verified and the heat capacity is independent of the deformation parameter."

In our approach, to obtain such a relation we use the basic ideas of the method of nonequilibrium statistical operator combined with the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. First of all, we define the thermodynamic relation for the system with homogeneous distribution of particles. Possible behavior peculiarities of systems with different character of interaction in nonequilibrium case are predicted. By saddle-point method we find the dominant contributions to the partition function and obtain all thermodynamic parameters of the systems with different character of interaction. The formations of saddle state in all systems of interacting particles at different temperatures and particle distributions have the same physical nature and therefore they can be described in the same way. We consider the systems with attractive and repulsive interactions as well as self-gravitating systems."

Using density functional theory with Hubbard correction (DFT+$U$, $U = 4$~eV), we investigate X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) alloys, which stabilize in the ferromagnetic L2$_1$-type structure with strong thermodynamic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveal contrasting behaviors: Ti$_2$MnGa transitions from a metallic L2$_1$-type phase to a spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) in the XA-type, while Ir$_2$MnGa exhibits gapless half-metallicity behavior in the L2$_1$-type but becomes half-metallic in the XA-type. The magnetic properties are governed by spd hybridization between Mn-3$d$ and X-$d$/Ga-$p$ states, which stabilizes ferromagnetism and tailors electronic states near the Fermi level. The Hubbard $U$ correction proves essential for accurately describing the correlated Mn-3$d$ electrons. These alloys combine structural stability with tunable electronic and magnetic properties, offering a promising platform for spin-polarized transport in next-generation spintronic devices."

These devices possess two main sources of nonlinearity: the electromechanical coupling and the intrinsic contributions of the resonator that induce a Duffing-like nonlinear behavior. In this work, we observe the interplay between the two sources across different driving regimes. The main nonlinear feature we observe is the emergence of arch-like resonances in the electronic transport when the resonator is strongly driven. We show that our model is in good agreement with our experimental electron transport measurements on a suspended carbon nanotube. This characterization paves the way for the exploration of nonlinear phenomena using mesoscopic electromechanical resonators."

In this setting, shape control aims to traverse the stable sub-manifolds of the equilibrium set to meet some predefined requirements or optimization criteria. As finite deformations are allowed, the equilibrium set may have a non-trivial topology. This paper explores the implications of large shape changes and high compliance, such as the emergence of unstable equilibria and equilibrium sets with non-trivial topology. We identify various adaptivity scenarios, ranging from inverse kinematics to optimization and path planning problems, and discuss the role of time-dependent loads and requirements. The applicability of the proposed concepts is demonstrated through the example of a curved Kirchhoff rod that is susceptible to snap-through behavior."

Specifically, the focus is on TMDs such as MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2, promising for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics devices based on ultra-thin atomic layers. One of the main challenges in utilising TMDs for practical applications is the scalable production of defect-free materials on desired substrates. However, innovative growth strategies have been developed to address this issue and meet the growing demand for high-quality and controllable TMD materials. These strategies are compatible with conventional and unconventional substrates, opening up new possibilities for practical implementation. Furthermore, the article highlights the development of novel 2D TMDs with unique functionalities and remarkable chemistry. These advancements contribute to expanding the range of applications and capabilities of TMD materials, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with these ultra-thin layers. In addition to electronics, the article delves into the significant efforts dedicated to exploring the potential of 2D TMDs in energy and sensor applications. These materials have shown promising characteristics for energy storage and have been extensively studied for their sensing capabilities, showcasing their versatility and potential impact in these fields. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in 2D TMDs, emphasising their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy, and sensing.

Composition-dependent phase analysis shows formation of three areas with different phase constitutions in dependance of Co-content: In the La-rich region with low Co content, a mixture of the phases La2O3, perovskite, and La(OH)3 is observed. In the Co-rich region, perovskite and spinel phases form. Between the three-phase region and the Co-rich two-phase region, a single-phase perovskite region emerges. Surface microstructure analysis shows formation of additional crystallites on the surface in the two-phase area, which become more numerous with increasing Ni-content. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis indicates that these crystallites mainly contain Co and Ni, so they could be spinels growing on the surface. The analysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity over all compositions and phase constitutions reveals that the perovskite/spinel two-phase region shows the highest catalytic activity, which increases with higher Ni-content. The highest OER current density was measured as 2.24 mA/cm2 at 1.8 V vs. RHE for the composition La11Co20Ni9O60."

      "summary": "The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases with decreasing thickness. We resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics, offering a strategy to eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations."

The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary electromagnetic current and the spin current made of the magnons) which could explain the conversion between the charge and spin currents, and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics."

This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies."

      "summary": "We investigate the nature of the topological phase transition of the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a magnetic field along the [111] direction. The field opens a topological gap in the Majorana fermion spectrum and leads to a sequence of topological phase transitions before the field polarised state is reached. At mean field level the gap first closes at the three $M$ points in the Brillouin zone, where the Majorana fermions form Dirac cones, resulting in a change of Chern number by three. An odd number of Dirac fermions in the infrared is unusual and requires Berry curvature compensation in the UV, which occurs via topological, ring-like hybridisation gaps with higher-energy bands. We perform a renormalisation-group analysis of the topological phase transition at the three $M$ points within the Yukawa theory, allowing for intra- and inter-valley fluctuations of the spin-liquid bond operators. We find that the latter lead to a breaking of Lorentz invariance and hence a different universality compared to the standard Ising Gross-Neveu-Yukawa class."

Theoretical simulations of TERS images often consider systems in isolation, ignoring any substrate support, such as metallic surfaces. Here, we show that this omission leads to deviations from experimentally measured data through simulations with a new finite-field formulation of first-principles simulation of TERS spectra that can address extended, periodic systems. We show that TERS images of tetracyanoethylene on Ag(100) and defective MoS$_2$ monolayers calculated using isolated molecules or cluster models are qualitatively different from those calculated when accounting for the periodicity of the substrate. For Mg(II)-porphine on Ag(100), a system for which a direct experimental comparison is possible, these simulations prove to be crucial for explaining the spatial variation of TERS intensity patterns and allow us to uncover fundamental principles of TERS spectroscopy. We explain how and why surface interactions affect images of out-of-plane vibrational modes much more than those of in-plane modes, providing an important tool for the future interpretation of these images in more complex systems."

Our numerical simulations demonstrate that in the strongly interacting regime, the system exhibits a distinct set of universal critical exponents, markedly different from those observed in the weakly interacting limit. This dichotomy aligns with experimental findings on the metal-insulator transition in 2DEGs, where high interaction strength (low carrier density) leads to qualitatively different behavior. The analysis includes scaling of the average electron density with temperature, the power spectral density, and the statistics of electronic avalanches - namely their size distributions and autocorrelation functions. In all cases, the extracted exponents differ significantly between the weak and strong interaction regimes, highlighting the emergence of two universality classes governed by interaction strength. These results underscore the critical role of electron correlations in the self-organized behavior of low-dimensional electronic systems."

      "summary": "Collective modes capture the dynamical aspects of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids. Depending on the active degrees of freedom, different types of collective modes can arise in a FQH state. In this work, we consider spinful FQH states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) along the Jain sequence of fillings $\\nu{=}n/(2n{\\pm}1)$ and compute the Coulomb dispersion of their spin-flip and spin-conserving collective modes in the spherical geometry. We use the LLL-projected density-wave and composite fermion (CF) exciton states as trial wave functions for these modes. To evaluate the dispersion of density-wave states, we derive the commutation algebra of spinful LLL-projected density operators on the sphere, which enables us to extract the gap of the density-wave excitations from the numerically computed density-density correlation function, i.e., the static structure factor, of the FQH ground state. We find that the CF excitons provide an accurate description of the collective modes at all wavelengths, while the density-wave states fail to do so. Specifically, the spin-flip density wave reliably captures the spin-flip collective mode only for the Laughlin and Halperin states, and that too only in the long-wavelength limit. Interestingly, for spin-singlet primary Jain states, the spin-conserving density mode is inaccurate even in the long-wavelength regime. We show that this discrepancy stems from the presence of an additional high-energy spin-conserving parton mode, similar to that found in fully polarized secondary Jain states at $\\nu{=}n/(4n{\\pm}1)$. We propose an ansatz for this parton mode and compute its Coulomb dispersion in the singlet state at $\\nu{=}2/5$. The predicted parton mode can be observed in circularly polarized inelastic light scattering experiments."

      "summary": "Electro-viscoelastic theory for polymer melts has been extensively studied experimentally for the past century, primarily for manufacturing purposes. However, the modeling and theory for this have been minimal, leaving many questions on the mechanisms and behavior of an arbitrary flow scheme. To remedy this, previously solved overdamped Langevin equations for the Doi-Rouse model are modified to include charge and electric field potential forces. The charge sequence on the chain is hypothesized to be a cosine sequence along the chain, resembling multiple electric dipoles that conveniently correspond to a Rouse mode of the chain. These are then solved for the shear stress under homogeneous shear rates and electric fields to find directional viscosity increases depending on the shearing and electric field orientation. Using the newly derived shear stress from the Doi-Rouse approach, a continuum model is proposed that resembles a modified upper-convected Maxwell model, including polarization stresses in terms of an electric field dyadic. This new continuum model, named the upper-convected electro-Maxwell model, is verified using Kremer-Grest polymer chains simulated with molecular dynamics for multiple flow schemes and a specified charge sequence along the chain. Furthermore, the MD results verified the difference in the overall and charge sequence relaxation times through the shear and normal stress polarizations, showing the necessity for the upper-convected derivative of the electric field dyadic to correct the viscosity scaling. Finally, the dynamic properties of the polarized polymer melt are examined analytically, finding that the phase shift is unaffected by the electric field contribution."

      "summary": "The relaxation of moir\\'e superlattices in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been modeled using a set of neural-network-based approaches. We implemented and compared several architectures, including (i) an interpolator combined with an autoencoder, (ii) an interpolator combined with a decoder, (iii) a direct generator mapping input parameters to displacement fields, and (iv) a physics-informed neural network (PINN). Among these, the direct generator architecture demonstrated the best performance, achieving machine-level precision with minimal training data. Remarkably, once trained, this simple fully connected network is able to predict the full displacement field of a moir\\'e bilayer within a fraction of a second, whereas conventional continuum simulations require hours or even days. This finding highlights the low-dimensional nature of the relaxation process and establishes neural networks as a practical and efficient alternative to ab initio approaches for rapid modeling and high-throughput screening of 2D twisted heterostructures."

      "summary": "Silver chromate ($\\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$) has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its promising photocatalytic performance, which strongly depends on the crystallographic orientation of its exposed surfaces. A detailed understanding of the structural stability of these surfaces under realistic conditions is therefore essential for advancing its applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory (DFT) with first-principles atomistic thermodynamics to systematically investigate the stability of multiple surface orientations and terminations of $\\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$. The surface Gibbs free energy was evaluated as a function of oxygen and silver chemical potentials, enabling the construction of stability trends under non-vacuum environments. Our results reveal that the degree of coordination of surface chromium-oxygen clusters plays a decisive role in determining surface stability. Furthermore, Wulff constructions predict morphology evolution as a function of external conditions, allowing us to identify the atomic structures of the exposed facets in the equilibrium crystal shape. These insights provide a fundamental framework for understanding surface-dependent photocatalytic activity in $\\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$ and related silver-based oxides."

      "summary": "Exotic collective phenomena emerge when bosons strongly interact within a lattice. However, creating a robust and tunable solid-state platform to explore such phenomena has been elusive. Dual moir\\'e systems$-$compromising two Coulomb-coupled moir\\'e lattices$-$offer a promising system for investigating strongly correlated dipolar excitons (composite bosons) with electrical control. Thus far, their implementation has been hindered by the relative misalignment and incommensurability of the two moir\\'e patterns. Here we report a dual moir\\'e system with perfect translational and rotational alignment, achieved by utilizing twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer to both generate an electrostatic moir\\'e potential and separate MoSe$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers. We observe strongly correlated electron phases driven by intralayer interactions and identify interlayer Rydberg trions, which become trapped in the presence of the Mott insulating state. Importantly, our platform is electrostatically programmable, allowing the realization of different lattice symmetries with either repulsive or attractive interlayer interactions. In particular, we implement the latter scenario by optically injecting charges, which form a dipolar excitonic phase. Our results establish a versatile platform for the exploration and manipulation of exotic and topological bosonic quantum many-body phases."

      "summary": "In order to fully utilize the technological potential of unconventional superconductors, an enhanced understanding of the superconducting mechanism is necessary. In the best performing superconductors, the cuprates, superconductivity is intimately linked with magnetism, although the details of this remain elusive. In search of clarity in the magnetism-superconductivity relationship, we focus on the electron-doped cuprate Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO(4-delta) (NCCO). NCCO has an antiferromagnetic ground state when synthesized, and only becomes superconducting after a reductive annealing process. This makes NCCO an ideal template to study how the magnetism differs in the superconducting and non-superconducting state, while keeping the material template as constant as possible. Using neutron spectroscopy, we reveal that the as-grown crystal exhibits a large energy gap in the magnetic fluctuation spectrum. Upon annealing, defects that are introduced by the commonly employed synthesis method, are removed and the gap is significantly reduced. While the energy gap in the annealed sample is an effect of superconductivity, we argue that the gap in the as-grown sample is caused by the absence of long-wavelength spin waves. The defects in as-grown NCCO thus play the dual role of suppressing both superconductivity and low-energy spin waves, highlighting the connection between these two phenomena."

      "summary": "Using \\textit{ab initio} methodology, we reveal a strain-mediated approach to precisely tune the magnetoelectric coupling and spin-driven emergent polarization of NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br) monolayers. In the absence of strain, these systems spontaneously stabilize non-collinear spin states that break the inversion symmetry, inducing a ferroelectric polarization in the plane of the material. We show that biaxial and uniaxial strains broadly modulate the magnetoelectric response in these materials through two distinct mechanisms: (i) direct modification of the magnetoelectric tensor components, and (ii) tuning of the characteristic propagation vectors of a spin texture. This dual mechanism enables precise control over the magnitude of the spin-induced electric polarization of these materials. With respect to the achievable magnitude of the electric polarization, we demonstrate the critical role of third-nearest-neighbor spin-pair contributions, which can increase under strain to levels that compete with or even exceed the polarization driven by first-nearest-neighbor effects. These findings offer important insights into low-dimensional piezo-magnetoelectricity and expand the possibilities for designing multifunctional two-dimensional straintronic devices."

      "summary": "Transport measurements of hybrid nanowires often rely on the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak as a hallmark of Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, such signatures can also be produced by trivial zero-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) or by quasi-Majorana bound states (QMBSs), complicating their unambiguous identification. Here we propose microwave absorption visibility, extracted from parity-dependent cavity-nanowire susceptibility measurements, as a complementary probe of MBSs nonlocality. We study a Rashba spin-orbit nanowire consisting of a proximitized superconducting segment and an uncovered quantum-dot region, capacitively coupled to a single-mode microwave cavity. We show that true MBSs yield finite visibility only when both MBSs are simultaneously coupled to the cavity, reflecting their intrinsic nonlocality. In contrast, ABSs and QMBSs exhibit visibility extrema even when the cavity couples only locally to part of the nanowire. We further demonstrate that this distinction persists in the presence of Gaussian disorder, which may otherwise generate trivial subgap states. Motivated by recent experiments, we also analyze ``poor man's\" Majoranas in double-quantum-dot setups, where analytical results confirm the same nonlocal visibility criterion. Finally, we discuss a cavity-driven scheme for initializing the electronic system in a given parity state. Our results establish cavity-based visibility as a robust and versatile probe of MBSs, providing a clear route to distinguish them from trivial zero-energy states in hybrid superconducting platforms."

It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface.

While static electric-field gradients are known to generate charge transport governed by the quantum metric, we show that AC field gradients induce an additional geometric current that vanishes in the DC limit. This response originates from a novel band-geometric quantity, the higher-order connection (HOC) tensor, constructed from cubic products of interband Berry connections. We derive explicit expressions for the AC current and identify the symmetry conditions under which it arises. Remarkably, inhomogeneous AC fields can generate an anomalous Hall-like response even in nonmagnetic systems. Applying the theory to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, we demonstrate that the HOC-induced response produces a measurable Hall current peaking at band edges. These results establish inhomogeneous AC fields as a powerful probe of higher-order band geometric quantities beyond Berry curvature and the quantum metric."

While conventional metals exhibit longitudinal magnetoconductivity that is even in a magnetic field ($B$) for small $B$, we show that magnetic materials which intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) show an {\\it odd-parity magnetoconductivity} (OMC), with a leading linear-$B$ response. Using semiclassical transport theory, we derive explicit expressions for the longitudinal and transverse conductivities and identify their origin in Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment. Crystalline symmetry analysis shows that longitudinal OMC follows the same point-group constraints as the anomalous Hall effect, while transverse OMC obeys distinct rules, providing an independent probe of TRS breaking. In the large $B$ quantum oscillation regime, we uncover both odd- and even-$B$ contributions, demonstrating OMC beyond the semiclassical picture. Explicit calculations in valley-polarized gapped graphene show that OMC peaks near the band edges, vanish in the band gap and follow the temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter. Our results explain the odd-parity magnetoresistance recently observed in magnetized graphene and establish OMC as a robust transport signature of intrinsic TRS breaking in metals."

Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), though generally regarded as conventional superconductors, display signatures of this unusual behavior and thus provide a particularly intriguing platform to explore how exotic states arise. Here we investigate the misfit compound (SnS)$_{1.15}$(TaS$_2$), a heterostructure composed of alternating SnS and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. Using transport, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SnS layers effectively decouple the TaS$_2$ into electronically isolated 1H sheets. In this limit, the tunneling density of states reveals a clear two-gap superconducting spectrum with T$_c \\sim$ 3.1 K. A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and finite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed singlet-triplet state. These results establish misfit compounds as a powerful platform for studying unconventional superconductivity in isolated 1H layers and for realizing multiple uncoupled superconductors within a single crystal."

Its rigorous derivation typically relies on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the Landau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach via functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This derivation is rigorous and does not involve any sophisticated mathematics. Our work provides insights into the origin of the exponential form of the Landau-Zener transition probability, and shows that the Landau-Zener formula can be viewed as a consequence of integrability, though the two-level Landau-Zener Hamiltonian itself does not satisfy the integrability conditions."

      "summary": "We study the dynamics and phase structure of Abelian gauge theories in $d=1+1$ dimensions. These include $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to a scalar and a fermion, as well as the two-flavour Schwinger model with different charges. Both theories exhibit a surprisingly rich phase diagram as masses are varied, with both $c=1$ and $c=1/2$ critical lines or points. We build up to the study of 2d chiral gauge theories, which hold particular interest because they provide a mechanism for symmetric mass generation, a phenomenon in which fermions become gapped without breaking chiral symmetries."

      "summary": "The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single (non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a distinctive local geometry, a \"texture,\" which can be characterized by the inner function's Jacobian $J({\\mathbf{x}})$, as $\\mathbf{x}$ varies over the data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers of $J(\\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor statistics of $J(\\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of $J(\\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the \"flip side\" of KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs."

      "summary": "Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface. Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection, and dataset optimization."

We perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square modulus normalization function that restores them.

Traditional density-functional theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved, including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc. There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system."

Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states have been extensively investigated for such applications. Here we present a pulsed protocol for generating CV cluster states in a phononic quantum network composed of phonon waveguides, mechanical resonators, and optical cavities. A key feature of this architecture is the modular design, where pairs of mechanical modes act as building blocks with only local, tunable interactions between mechanical and cavity modes. The scheme is scalable, requiring just $4N$ driving tones for $N$ mechanical resonators. We characterize the resulting cluster states by evaluating the nullifiers of the CV modes. We also study the effects of dissipation, showing that strong squeezing with large phonon occupations can degrade the generated cluster states under finite mechanical and optical losses. As a direct application, we demonstrate that distant mechanical modes can be entangled via local measurements."

      "summary": "Heavy metal-free quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) have demonstrated remarkable brightness, saturated color, and high efficiencies across a broad spectral range. However, in contrast to organic LEDs (OLEDs), QD-LED operational lifetimes remain limited, with the underlying degradation mechanisms not fully understood. In the present study, we show that InP/ZnSe/ZnS (red-emitting) and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS (blue-emitting) cadmium-free colloidal QD-LEDs undergo nanoscale morphological changes during operation. Specifically,interparticle coarsening and layer thinning are observed in the electron transport layer (ETL) consisting of ZnMgO nanoparticles (NPs), in the QD emissive layer, and in the organic hole transport layer. This is accompanied by the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals throughout the device, with oxygen accumulating at the electrode/ETL interfance. Moreover, in situ transmission electron microscopy reveals the electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO NPs coarsening. To mitigate these degradation pathway, we show that acrylate-based resin-encapsulation treatment stabilize the ETL/QD layers by suppressing the radical formation and halting morphology changes. This approach achieves dramatic stability enhancements, exhibits an 8-fold and 5000-fold lifetime improvement on InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs, respectively. Our findings establish the causal relationships between the morphological degradation, interlayer radical dynamics, and state-of-the-art QD-LEDs instability, providing new insights into a scalable encapsulation treatment that enables efficient and long-lived Cd-free QD-LEDs."

We illustrate our approach in non-resonantly pumped polariton lattices, where the nonlinear interaction between the polaritons and the exciton reservoir due to non-resonant pumping can yield a dynamical change of the topology. Moreover, using a continuous model of the polariton system based on a driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation alongside the spectral localizer framework, we show that the local changes in the nonlinear non-Hermitian system's topology are captured by a local Chern marker. Looking forward, we anticipate such reconfigurable topological routing will enable the realization of novel classes of topological photonic devices."

In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation.

To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface.

      "summary": "Non-Markovian dynamics is central to quantum information processing, as memory effects strongly influence coherence preservation, metrology, and communication. In this work, we investigate the role of stochastic system--bath couplings in shaping non-Markovian behavior of open quantum systems, using the central spin model within a time-convolutionless master equation framework. We show that the character of the reduced dynamics depends jointly on the intrinsic memory of the environment and on the structure of the system--environment interaction. In certain regimes, the dynamics simplify to pure dephasing, while in general both amplitude damping and dephasing contribute to the evolution. By employing two complementary measures: the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) flow and the Breuer--Laine--Piilo (BLP) measure, we demonstrate that QFI flow may fail to witness memory effects in weak-coupling and near-resonant regimes, whereas the BLP measure still detects information backflow. Furthermore, external modulation of the interaction kernel produces qualitatively richer behavior, including irregular and frequency-dependent revivals of non-Markovianity. These results clarify the physical origin of memory effects, highlight the limitations of single-witness approaches, and suggest that stochasticity and modulation can be harnessed to engineer robust, noise-resilient quantum technologies."

The algorithm is for instance applicable to problems with strongly coupled, or non-Markovian, environments; problems with multiple environments out of mutual equilibrium; and problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the algorithm can reproduce the true dynamics of such problems at arbitrary accuracy and, for a broad range of problems, only adds a minor resource cost relative to Trotterized time evolution; the cost is polynomial in the inverse target accuracy. The algorithm is based on the insight that any Gaussian environment can be represented as a train of ancillary qubits that sequentially interact with the system through a time-local coupling, given by the convolution square root of the bath correlation function; this is a secondary result of our work. Our results open up new applications of quantum computers for efficient simulation of non-equilibrium and open quantum systems."

When a parameter in such a background exceeds a certain critical value, the speed of the Liouville wall exceeds the speed of light, and there is no usual S-Matrix. We examine such backgrounds in the dual $c=1$ matrix model from the point of view of fluctuations of the collective field, and determine the nature of the emergent space-time perceived by these fluctuations. We show that so long as the corresponding Liouville wall remains time-like, the emergent space time is conformal to full Minkowski space with a time-like wall. However, for the cases where the Liouville wall is superluminal, the emergent space-time has a {\\em space-like boundary} where the collective field couplings diverge. This appears as a space-like singularity in perturbative collective field theory. We comment on the necessity of incorporating finite $N$, as well as finite (double-scaled) coupling, effects to understand the behavior of the exact theory near this boundary."

      "summary": "Molecular dynamics computer simulations have been conducted on neat liquid methanol, using three different united atom (three site) interatomic potentials: TraPPE [J. Phys. Chem. B 105, 3093 (2001)], UAM-I [J. Mol. Liq. 323, 114576 (2021)] and OPLS/2016 [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 034508 (2016)]. The effects of pressure, between 1 bar and 6 kbar, have been evaluated on total scattering structure factors, partial radial distribution functions, as well as on collective characteristics such as ring size distributions and cluster size distributions. Agreement with experimental density is nearly quantitative for all the three force fields, and major trends observed for recent pressure dependent neutron diffraction data are reproduced qualitatively. The OPLS/2016 force field, in general, generates properties that are markedly different from results originating from the other potentials. Pressure effects are hardly noticeable on most partial radial distribution functions and on the distribution of the number of hydrogen bonded neighbours. On the other hand, collective structural properties, like cluster- and ring size distributions exhibit significant changes with increasing pressure: larger clusters become more numerous, whereas the number of cyclic clusters, i.e., rings, decrease. The self-diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing pressure, and the same is valid for the average lifetime of hydrogen bonds."

      "summary": "A systematic comparison was carried out to assess the influence of representative thermostat methods in constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. The thermostat schemes considered include the Nos\\'e--Hoover thermostat and its chain generalisation, the Bussi velocity rescaling method, and several implementations of the Langevin dynamics. Using a binary Lennard-Jones liquid as a model glass former, we investigated how the sampling of physical observables, such as particle velocities and potential energy, responds to changes in time step across these thermostats. While the Nos\\'e--Hoover chain and Bussi thermostats provide reliable temperature control, a pronounced time-step dependence was observed in the potential energy. Amongst the Langevin methods, the Gr{\\o}nbech-Jensen--Farago scheme provided the most consistent sampling of both temperature and potential energy. Nonetheless, Langevin dynamics typically incurs approximately twice the computational cost due to the overhead of random number generation, and exhibits a systematic decrease in diffusion coefficients with increasing friction. This study presents a broad comparison of thermostat methods using a binary Lennard-Jones glass-former model, offering practical guidance for the choice of thermostats in classical molecular dynamics simulations. These findings provide useful insights for diverse applications, including glass transition, phase separation, and nucleation."

A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated."

      "summary": "We introduce the Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CVQE), a hardware-efficient framework for accurate ground-state quantum simulation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. CVQE departs from conventional VQE by incorporating a measurement-driven feedback cycle: Slater determinants with significant sampling probability are iteratively added to the reference superposition, while a fixed entangler (e.g., single-layer UCCSD) is reused throughout. This adaptive reference growth systematically enlarges the variational space in most promising directions, avoiding manual ansatz or operator-pool design, costly searches, and preserving compile-once circuits. The strategy parallels multi-reference methods in quantum chemistry, while remaining fully automated on quantum hardware. Remarkably, CVQE exhibits a distinctive staircase-like descent pattern, where successive energy drops sharply signal efficient escape from barren plateaus. Benchmarks show that CVQE consistently maintains chemical precision across correlation regimes, outperforms fixed UCCSD by several orders of magnitude, and achieves favorable accuracy-cost trade-offs compared to the Selected Configuration Interaction. These results position CVQE as a scalable, interpretable, and resource-efficient paradigm for near-term quantum simulation."

      "summary": "We introduce a hybrid approach for computing dynamical observables in strongly correlated systems using higher-order moments. This method integrates memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems. The method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the moments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as matrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively. Crucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved through an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the spectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the method to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all cases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG) benchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational efficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These findings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for simulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum systems."

      "summary": "Two hallmarks of non-equilibrium systems, from active colloids to animal herds, are agents motility and nonreciprocal interactions. Their interplay creates feedback loops leading to complex spatiotemporal dynamics crucial to understand and control the nonlinear response of active systems. Here, we introduce a minimal model that captures these two features at the microscopic scale, while admitting an exact hydrodynamic theory valid also in the fully-nonlinear regime. Our goal is to account for the fact that animal herds and colloidal swarms are rarely in the thermodynamic limit where particle number fluctuations can be completely ignored. Using statistical mechanics techniques we exactly coarse-grain a nonreciprocal microscopic model into a fluctuating hydrodynamics and use dynamical systems insights to analyze the resulting equations. In the absence of motility, we find two transitions to oscillatory phases occurring via distinct mechanisms: a Hopf bifurcation and a Saddle-Node on Invariant Circle (SNIC) bifurcation. In the presence of motility, this rigorous approach, complemented by numerical simulations, allows us to quantitatively assess the hitherto neglected impact of inter-species nonreciprocity on a paradigmatic transition in active matter: the emergence of collective motion. When nonreciprocity is weak, we show that flocking is accelerated and bands tend to synchronize with a spatial overlap controlled by nonlinearities. When nonreciprocity is strong, flocking is superseded by a Chase & Rest dynamical phase where each species alternates between a chasing state, when they propagate, and a resting state, when they stand still. Finally, we demonstrate how fluctuations in finite systems can be harnessed to characterize microscopic non-reciprocity from macroscopic time-correlation functions, even in phases where nonreciprocal interactions do not affect the thermodynamic steady-state."

      "summary": "A microscopic theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) in a disordered 2D electron system with spin-orbit scatterings under parallel magnetic field is presented in light of the observation, at low temperatures, of large magnetoresistance (MR) above a crossover field to superconductivity in electron-doped SrTiO$_{3}$/LaAlO$_{3}$ interfaces. It is found that in the zero temperature limit the conventional (diagrammatic) microscopic theory of superconducting (SC) fluctuations yields vanishing fluctuation conductivity just above the superconducting transition. However, further analysis of the results of the microscopic theory reveals that due to the diminishing stiffness of the fluctuation modes in a broad range of momentum space, the density of the CPFs, defined consistently with the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach, diverges in the zero temperature limit at any finite magnetic field. This field-induced divergence of the CPFs density, within restricted mesoscopic regions in real space, which is relieved by quantum tunneling and pair breaking out of their mesoscopic enclaves, indicates that the grand canonical ensemble underlying the microscopic theory is unsubstantiated. A dynamical equilibrium between the condensed CPFs in real-space mesoscopic puddles and the rarefying system of unpaired electrons controls the residual normal-state conductivity at magnetic fields above the SC transition. It has been, therefore, concluded that under the diminishing fluctuation paraconductivity upon increasing magnetic field the density of the normal-state electrons is also suppressed (due to charge transfer to the localized CPFs) and so, resulting from electron localization, the overall MR is strongly enhanced."

      "summary": "The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids. Here, we derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier due to the crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in reasonable agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are compared with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. The comparison suggests that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity."

      "summary": "Motivated by recent work connecting Higgs phases to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, we investigate the interplay of gauge redundancy and global symmetry in lattice gauge theories with Higgs fields in the presence of a boundary. The core conceptual point is that a global symmetry associated to a Higgs field, which is pure-gauge in a closed system, acts physically at the boundary under boundary conditions which allow electric flux to escape the system. We demonstrate in both Abelian and non-Abelian models that this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the Higgs regime, implying the presence of gapless edge modes. Starting with the U(1) Abelian Higgs model in 4D, we demonstrate a boundary phase transition in the 3D XY universality class separating the bulk Higgs and confining regimes. Varying the boundary coupling while preserving the symmetries shifts the location of the boundary phase transition. We then consider non-Abelian gauge theories with fundamental and group-valued Higgs matter, and identify the analogous non-Abelian global symmetry acting on the boundary generated by the total color charge. For SU($N$) gauge theory with fundamental Higgs matter we argue for a boundary phase transition in the O($2N$) universality class, verified numerically for $N=2,3$. For group-valued Higgs matter, the boundary theory is a principal chiral model exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate this mechanism in theories with higher-form Higgs fields. We show how the higher-form matter symmetry acts at the boundary and can spontaneously break, exhibiting a boundary confinement-deconfinement transition. We also study the electric-magnetic dual theory, demonstrating a dual magnetic defect condensation transition at the boundary. We discuss some implications and extensions of these findings and what they may imply for the relation between Higgs and SPT phases."

      "summary": "The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of fracture in heterogeneous materials and for predicting fracture surface formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order, perturbations. However, large and localized disturbances to crack motion induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects beyond the existing linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts and of straight dynamic fronts."

However, rotating the DW's phase away from the stable phase may cause the successful capture and hence creation of a stable bound state of a magnetic Skyrmion and a DW: the DW-Skyrmion. At certain distances, the DW may also destroy the magnetic Skyrmion by inducing shrinkage of the latter. This happens as the isolated magnetic Skyrmion has negative DMI energy, whereas the DW-Skyrmion has positive DMI energy; in a finite range from the DW, the magnetic Skyrmion can be pushed to have vanishing DMI energy, for which it collapses to a point. En passant, we find the possibility of pair creation of a Skyrmion anti-DW-Skyrmion pair and a creation of more than one DW-Skyrmions by a Kibble-like mechanism."

Front propagation is governed by local energy balance between the elastic energy per unit area available to fracture, G, and the dissipation in creating new surfaces. G is known analytically as a perturbation series in the crack front fluctuation. For dissipation that monotonically increases with the crack speed, we derive an equation of motion for crack fronts that is second-order accurate. In the linear order, heterogeneity does not change the net speed of fracture. In the second order, nonlinear interactions of the front and the heterogeneous landscape populate an intermediate-scale fluctuation spectrum. We find that, when dissipation weakly grows with velocity, nonlinearities globally amplify dissipation and reduce the crack speed. Strong velocity dependence, however, mitigates toughening effects and may facilitate fracture."

      "summary": "Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) -- rare eigenstates that evade thermalization -- are typically characterized by their low entanglement entropies compared to surrounding thermal eigenstates. However, due to finite-size effects in systems accessible via exact diagonalization, this measure can be ambiguous. To address this limitation, we propose using the correlation matrix spectrum as an alternative probe to identify QMBS. In cases of exact QMBS that either have known analytic expressions or are captured by various frameworks of QMBS, we find that the dimensionality of the null space of the correlation matrix -- an integer value, and thus immune to finite-size effects -- can qualitatively identify QMBS. Beyond serving as a diagnostic tool, the correlation matrix method enables the manipulation of the QMBS subspace. For approximate QMBS, such as those in the PXP model, we observe that the correlation matrix spectrum features numerous approximate zero eigenvalues, thereby distinguishing these states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this method with several paradigmatic QMBS examples."

Here, we study how non-Abelian properties emerge in non-Hermitian systems by considering a multi-band non-Hermitian model -- the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) ladder that is formed by coupling two nonreciprocal SSH chains. Under periodic boundary conditions, we analytically obtain the exact phase diagrams of the geometry of band structure classified by its complex value and gap type, and of the non-Abelian topology based on a newly defined gauge-invariant winding number under the chiral symmetry. Under open boundary conditions, we find that the bulk-boundary correspondence survives in the thermodynamic limit but breaks down for finite sizes along with the emergence of critical non-Hermitian skin effects when the inter-leg coupling is weak, where the decaying length $\\xi$ of the bulk skin modes varies with the system size $L$, satisfying the scale-free power law $\\xi\\propto L$. Finally, we demonstrate the non-Abelian dynamics of a Bloch state subject to an external constant force in the pseudo-Hermitian symmetric regime in comparison with the non-Hermitian Wilson lines. Our work may stimulate further interests in nontrivial non-Abelian behaviors in non-Hermitian and open quantum systems."

      "summary": "We report combined scanning probe microscopy and electrical measurements to investigate local electronic transport in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that quantum transport in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied with a conducting atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. Scanning gate microscopy (SGM) reveals a clear p-type response in which local gating modulates the source-drain current, while scanning impedance microscopy (SIM) indicates corresponding shifts of the Fermi level under different gating conditions. The observed transport behavior arises from the combined effects of the AFM tip induced Fermi level shifts and defect mediated scattering. These results show that resonant scattering associated with impurities or structural defects plays a central role and highlight the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on rGO conduction. Consistent with this electrostatic control, the device also exhibits chemical gating and sensing: during exposure to electron-withdrawing molecules (acetone), the source-drain current increases reversibly and returns to baseline upon purging with air. Repeated cycles over 15 minutes show reproducible amplitudes and recovery. Using a simple transport model we estimate an increase of about 40 percent in carrier density during exposure, consistent with p-type doping by electron-accepting analytes. These findings link nanoscale electrostatic control to macroscopic sensing performance, advancing the understanding of charge transport in rGO and underscoring its promise for nanoscale electronics, flexible chemical sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "Three-body resonances are ubiquitous in few-body physics and are characterized by a finite lifetime before decaying into continuum states of their composing subsystems. In this work we present a theoretical study on the possibility to stabilize three-body resonances to so-called bound states in a continuum: resonances with vanishing width that do not decay. Within a simple two-channel approach we unveil the underlying mechanism and suggest that the lifetime can be varied by a continuous tuning of system parameters. The validity of our theory is illustrated in two rather different examples, a mass-imbalanced system in one dimension and a system of three identical bosons in three dimensions, relevant to Efimov physics. Crucially, for the latter we find that one of the tunable parameters to achieve a three-body bound state in a continuum is an external magnetic field, a common tunable variable in cold-atom experiments. Due to the fundamental nature of our theory, it is expected to hold in other few-body systems, possibly opening new avenues for basic studies of otherwise unstable systems, and elevating few-body systems to interesting candidates for quantum technology."

This is dramatically exploited in moir\\'e systems, where a lattice mismatch or twist between monolayers generates an emergent in-plane periodicity, giving rise to electronic properties absent in the constituent materials. In contrast, vertical superlattices, formed by stacking dissimilar materials in the out-of-plane direction on the nanometer scale, have received far less attention despite their potential to realize analogous emergent phenomena in three dimensions. Through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory, we investigate six-to-eight-layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures constructed from pairs of stacked few-layer materials. Counterintuitively, we find that even these single superlattice units can host fully-delocalised bands, evidencing a robust coherent interlayer coupling across lattice-mismatched interfaces over extended spatial scales. We show how uncompensated semimetallic phases and energetically-mismatched topological surface states are readily and exclusively stabilized within such asymmetrical architectures. These findings establish two-component heterostructures in the intermediate layer-regime as platforms to invoke and control unprecedented combinations and instances of the diverse quantum phases native to many-layer TMDs."

We investigate one particular example of this problem: the irreversibility of heat transfer through an interface between two materials. This special case turned out to be much simpler than that of transport phenomena in bulk materials. We start by exploring a mechanism that turns equations of reversible, unitary transmission of wave-particles through the interface into irreversible equations, describing the distribution functions at the interface. This mechanism, non-coherence, is treated in an analogy with wave optics: no real waves are absolutely monochromatic and thus have finite temporal coherence. We find an experimental setup to prove the suggested mechanism and calculate the optimal parameters to observe the phenomenon. We conduct an experiment whose results fully agree with the predictions of our theory. In the final discussion, we revisit the connection with heat transport through a material interface and show that only the suggested mechanism can explain the irreversibility of interfacial transport."

      "summary": "Motivated by the study of stacking faults in weak topological insulators and the observation of magnetic domain walls in MnBi$_{2n}$Te$_{3n+1}$, we explore the topological properties of magnetic domain walls in antiferromagnetic topological insulators. We develop two tight-binding models for two different types of antiferromagnetic topological insulators: the first type obtained by adding antiferromagnetic order to a strong topological insulator, and another built from stacked Chern insulating layers with alternating Chern numbers. Both systems are dual topological insulators, i.e. they are at the same time antiferromagnetic and crystalline topological insulators, but differ by the type of mirror symmetry protecting the crystalline phase: spinful versus spinless. We show that in the spinful case the mirror Chern number is invariant under time reversal and that it changes sign in the spinless case. This influences the properties of the two systems in the presence of a magnetic domain wall, which we model as an interface between two regions of opposite magnetization. In the first type, the bulk of the magnetic domain wall is gapped but the defect will host chiral edge states when it ends on an external ferromagnetic surface. In the second, due to the change in the sign of the mirror Chern number, the magnetic domain wall is a two-dimensional embedded semimetal with 2D gapless states protected by mirror symmetry. Our results show that magnetic domain walls can be a source of non-trivial topology, allowing to generate and manipulate gapless states within the bulk and the ferromagnetic surfaces of antiferromagnetic topological insulators."

Here, we report the discovery of short-wavelength magnons with lifetimes exceeding 18 {\\mu}s at millikelvin temperatures. The experiment was performed on an ultra-pure single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) sphere over a wide temperature range, from ambient down to 30 mK. These results directly confirm the theoretical prediction that the magnon lifetime in an ideal YIG crystal at zero temperature is infinite, paving the way for the engineering of lossless magnetic systems in which magnons will be employed as long-lived carriers of information for quantum gates and quantum storage."

This study presents a mesoscale finite element model (MFEM) that offers detailed insights into the fracture process at the aggregate--cement matrix interface, focusing on one of concrete's key properties: its mechanical response. Unlike discrete models, which often average out critical stress concentrations within the mesostructure, the MFEM approach captures detailed stress distributions, revealing localized effects crucial for understanding damage evolution. Although computationally more demanding, the MFEM leverages modern high-performance computing (HPC) to provide a detailed description of the stress field and material damage across different phases and interfaces. The proposed modeling framework integrates a collision-checked aggregate generation procedure, Voronoi-based mesostructure construction, and adaptive 3D meshing, forming a reusable methodology for stress analysis in heterogeneous composites. This approach offers transparent, physically interpretable parameterization of phase properties in contrast to black-box discrete models. Another methodological contribution is the statistical post-processing of stress data using histogram-based analysis across cross-sectional planes. This enables quantitative evaluation of stress concentration distributions, providing valuable insights into the mesoscale mechanical response and serving as a useful visualization tool for researchers working on heterogeneous material modeling. Various matrix-to-aggregate stiffness ratios are considered to evaluate the influence of material heterogeneity on the stress field."

This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics."

By adopting the statistics of rooted-directed trees as a proxy for that of undirected trees without internal loops and by an exact mapping of the model into a field theory, we compute the entropy and the mean number of branch-nodes within a mean field approximation and in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we find that the mean number of branch-nodes is independent of both the lattice details and the lattice occupation, depending only on the associated chemical potential. Monte Carlo simulations in $d=2,3,4$ provide evidence of the remarkable accuracy of the mean field theory, more accurate for higher dimensions."

Here, we report a superionic-like thermal transport alongside restricted long-range ion migration in CsCu_2I_3 with incipient ionic conduction, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, inelastic X-ray scattering, and machine-learning potential-based simulations. We reveal that the Cu ions exhibit confined migration between CuI_4 tetrahedra at high temperatures, displaying extreme anharmonicity of dominated phonons beyond conventional rattling and comparable to that in superionic conductorsl. Consequently, a glass-like \\kappa (~0.3 W m^{-1} K^{-1} at 300 K) following the relationship of \\kappa ~ T^{0.17}, was achieved along the x-direction, where Cu ion migration is three oders of magnitude lower than in superionic conductors. These results highlight the advantage of incipient ionic conductors in simultaneously maintaining both low \\kappa and high stability, elucidate the thermal transport mechanism via ion migration constraints, and pave an effective pathway toward ultralow thermal conductivity in ionic conductors."

The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications."

A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete spin freezing below $T_f \\approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T = 0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below $T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate, and a gapped excitation centered at $\\hbar\\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow component $\\tau_{\\mathrm{slow}} \\sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component $\\tau_{\\mathrm{fast}} \\sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for QSI systems.

In contrast to prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schr\\\"odinger treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions, wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify \"sweet spots\" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near $B^{-8}$.

The foundation model, trained across the periodic table up to Pu, demonstrates strong performance across key materials modelling challenges. It effectively captures long-range interactions that are challenging for traditional message-passing mechanisms and accurately reproduces polarization effects under external electric fields. We have applied the model to mechanical properties, ionic diffusivity in solid-state electrolytes, ferroelectric phase transitions, and reactive dynamics at electrode-electrolyte interfaces, highlighting the model's capacity to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

Numerical verification in fermionic and bosonic chains confirms this volume-law fragmentation phenomenon.

Traditional QST relies on projective measurements of single- and two-qubit Pauli operators, requiring the system of interest to be isolated from environmental dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring currents and associated transport quantities flowing through a quantum system in an open configuration enable the reconstruction of its quantum state. This result relies on an exact relation between transport quantities and the Krylov subspaces associated with the Lindbladian which encodes the dynamical evolution of an open quantum system. We illustrate this transport approach to QST with the explicit example of a two-qubit system embedded in a two-terminal setup. As a direct consequence of our framework, we are able to provide a transport-based entanglement measure to certify the presence of quantum correlations, expressing the concurrence in terms of current averages and correlations function only. Our findings are analytical, providing fundamental insights into quantum information processing in open quantum systems. They establish new connections between the fields of mesoscopic physics and quantum information theory."

This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics."

We propose two new types of local decoders for the quantum repetition code in one dimension. The signal-rule decoders interpret odd parities between neighboring qubits as defects, attracted to each other via the exchange of classical point-like excitations, represented by a few bits of local memory. We prove the existence of a threshold in the code-capacity model and present numerical evidence of exponential logical error suppression under a phenomenological noise model, with data and measurement errors at each error correction cycle. Compared to previously known local decoders that suffer from sub-optimal threshold and scaling, our construction significantly narrows the gap with global decoders for practical system sizes and error rates. Implementation requirements can be further reduced by eliminating the need for local classical memories, with a new rule defined on two rows of qubits. This shearing-rule works well at relevant system sizes making it an appealing short-term solution. When combined with biased-noise qubits, such as cat qubits, these decoders enable a fully local quantum memory in one dimension."

Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments."

When multiple mechanical oscillators are coupled to a single electromagnetic mode, these interactions can be extended to utilize the electromagnetic mode as a mediator for distributing noise squeezing among different mechanical oscillators. We investigate the transfer of mechanical noise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave cavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing in one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of its resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously, optomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical modes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode (target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical modes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from the squeezing in the control mode. Remarkably, the observed squeezing transfer manifests noise characteristics of both single-mode and two-mode squeezing. This unique feature suggests that the squeezing transfer holds significant potential for enhancing precision measurements."

Though approximate, the analytical formulas for the unstrained system are highly accurate unless the twist angle is less than 0.4°, far below the first magic angle. When the twist angle is around or above ≳ 1°, the formulas for the strained system are also highly accurate, even if the heterostrain is as large as 1 % .

This approach allows the authors to incorporate the coupling between dissipative currents and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking order parameters, which can stabilize very strong nonreciprocity. While the mechanism is specifically illustrated for systems with two valleys, such as multilayer graphene, it remains more generally applicable. [Phys. Rev.
