      "summary": "Nature Physics, Published online: 02 January 2026; doi:10.1038/s41567-025-03123-0 Superradiance is usually driven by light-mediated couplings, leaving the role of direct emitter interactions unclear. Now, it is shown that dipole–dipole interactions in diamond spins drive self-induced pulsed and continuous superradiant masing."

This Review presents key computational advances in materials design over the past few decades, highlighting the paradigm shift from conventional screening approaches to inverse generation driven by deep generative models. Current challenges and future perspectives of materials inverse design are also discussed."
