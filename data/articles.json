We found that there were obvious problems in previous papers. After a certain period, the overall system pressure became excessively high, causing simulation crashes and preventing analysis of subsequent results. In addition, understanding of potential function selection was incomplete. Therefore, after correcting these issues, a simulation system with relatively stable pressure was constructed. In addition to the result analysis, a potential-function selection table is provided, with some parameters taken from prior experimental calculations and others obtained via DFT calculations."

Predicting these properties accurately demands expensive calculations. We address this using a validated semi-empirical protocol (GFN2-xTB geometries, sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB excited states) on 747 molecules, combined with charge-transfer descriptors from Natural Transition Orbital analysis. The hole-electron spatial overlap She emerges as a key predictor, accounting for 21% of feature importance for the triplet state alone. Our best model (Support Vector Regression) reaches MAE = 0.024 eV and R2 = 0.96 for $\\Delta E_{ST}$. Active learning reduces the data needed to reach target accuracy by approximately 25% compared to random sampling. Three application domains are explored: NIR-emitting probes for bioimaging, photocatalytic sensitizers, and fast-response materials for photodetection."

      "summary": "We report the results and unique instrument configuration of a novel experiment in which we successfully transitioned a DPPH sample from its natural paramagnetic state and essentially a non-magnetic material to a ferromagnetic state at room temperature. This was achieved using a specifically applied helical flux magnetic field. The DPPH sample (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) remained ferromagnetic for at least one hour after the experiment, indicating that a transformation in the material was induced by the external field rather than being merely a temporary magnetic phase transition observed only during the experiment. The external magnetic field used had a helical pitch angle of approximately $54.7{\\deg}$, known mathematically as the Magic Angle, relative to the +z-axis, which is aligned with the normal S to N external field's magnetic moment vector. Based on the phenomenology of the experiment, we infer that this specific magic angle corresponding to the known quantization precession spin angle of free electrons under a homogeneous straight flux magnetic field potentially enhances the percentage of unpaired valence electrons within the DPPH material, allowing them to align in parallel with the applied external field. Typically, in paramagnetic materials, the distribution of unpaired electrons' quantum spins relative to an external field is nearly random, showing roughly a 50% chance of either parallel or antiparallel alignment. Only a slight majority preference exists in one alignment direction due to the Boltzmann thermal distribution, which contributes to the paramagnetic nature of these materials. In our measurements, we found that the induced ferromagnetism of the DPPH sample resulted in an abnormal thousand-fold decimal value increase in relative magnetic permeability at ${\\mu}{\\approx}1.4$, compared to its typical paramagnetic value of $1.0001$ for this material."

We dub the hybrid system, and equivalent intrinsically superconducting phases, a \\emph{Chern dartboard superconductor} (CDSC). We show that a CDSC can have nontrivial sBZ topology if it arises from a CDI that has an even number of mirror symmetries $n$. On the other hand, particle-hole symmetry constrains a CDSC that arises from an odd-$n$ CDI to have trivial sBZ topology. However, we can circumvent this constraint for $n=1$ by inducing an FFLO-type pairing or shifting the CDI in momentum space, converting the mirror symmetry to a momentum-space nonsymmorphic mirror symmetry. With a superconducting pairing that preserves the (nonsymmorphic) mirror symmetries, even-$n$ CDIs and the shifted $n=1$ CDI can realize the minimal spinless phase that has a trivial total Chern number and nontrivial reduced Chern numbers. With a pairing that breaks the mirror symmetries, the hybrid system can realize phases that have nontrivial total and reduced Chern numbers, expanding the classification of phases that have sub-Brillouin zone (sBZ) topology. We also predict that some types of $n=2$ CDSCs inherit the quantized crystalline response of the $n=2$ CDI, providing experimentalists with a well-defined way to probe the CDSC. Our work motivates further exploration of sBZ topology, bulk topology, and quantized response."

      "summary": "Quantum geometric electronic responses are often viewed through a non-interacting lens: independent quasiparticles accumulate Berry phases as they move through a static crystal and background potential. Here we argue that the combined action of electron-electron interactions and an out-of-equilibrium many-body state can produce striking departures from this familiar picture. We demonstrate how nonequilibrium exchange interactions produce a nonequilibrium collective quantum geometry distinct from that of its equilibrium ground state. We find this manifests as an exchange induced nonlinear Hall effect with nonlinear Hall current signals competitive with that of well-known non-interacting mechanisms. This highlights the critical role electron interactions and nonequilibrium states can play in the nonlinear response of quantum matter."

We present a comparative study of two control paradigms for the one-hole, half-filled Hubbard model: (i) systematic physics-guided design and (ii) autonomous deep reinforcement learning with geometry-aware neural architectures. While systematic analysis reveals key design principles, such as field-induced localization for trapping the mobile hole, it becomes computationally intractable for optimization. We show that an autonomous RL agent, benchmarked across five 3D lattices from tetrahedron to FCC, achieves human-competitive accuracy (R^2 > 0.97) and 95.5 percent success on held-out tasks. The agent is 3-4 orders of magnitude more sample-efficient than grid search and outperforms other black-box optimization methods. Transfer learning yields 91 percent few-shot generalization to unseen geometries. This work establishes autonomous RL as a viable and highly efficient framework for rapid optimization and non-obvious strategy discovery in complex quantum systems."

      "summary": "Pair density waves (PDW) are novel forms of superconducting states that exhibit periodically modulated pairing. A remaining challenge is to elucidate how intrinsic PDW order can emerge robustly in strongly correlated electrons. Here we propose that PDW is prone to form in strongly coupled multiband superconductors simply with interband Cooper pairing between electrons from oppositely dispersing bands. This scenario is heuristically motivated by the observation that uniform interband pairing in such systems would exhibit negative superfluid weight -- a signature of an instability towards pairing modulation, implying that PDW emerges naturally in the true ground state. Using large-scale density-matrix-renormalization-group calculations with finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate this PDW mechanism in a minimal model with strong interband attractions. Our simulations reveal power-law superconducting correlations characterized by incommensurate modulations. The exponent $K_{sc}$ of the power-law PDW correlation decreases systematically with increasing ladder width, confirming a genuine long-range PDW order in the 2D limit. Our study therefore demonstrates a promising route to robust PDW states in multiband systems."

      "summary": "Materials with broken fundamental symmetries, such as chiral crystals, provide a rich playground for exploring unconventional spin-dependent transport phenomena. The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties."

We use the 3{\\omega} technique applied to quasi-two-dimensional silicon nitride membranes having a metal line heater patterned on the surface to both deliver heat and directly measure the thermal impedance of the membrane at the heating frequency, Z(2{\\omega}). We derive an expression for the complex thermal impedance as a function of frequency, approximating the actual rectangular membranes with a one dimensional model. The derivation accounts for potential parasitic heat loss mechanisms including conduction along the heater line, and by the gas load in an imperfect vacuum. Qualitatively, the thermal impedance response resembles a low-pass filter, owing to the combination of the total thermal resistance and total specific heat. Fitting Z(2{\\omega}) to measurements across a few decades in frequency, we extract values of the thermal conductivity and specific heat of silicon nitride in agreement with literature values. We also study the dependence on the heating current, and compare to measurements of the thermal conductivity at zero frequency."

      "summary": "Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments reporting a pair-density modulation (PDM) in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, we develop a Landau theory to elucidate the physical origin of this phenomenon. We analyze the PDM in terms of the screw symmetry of the single layer, interpreting it as a hybridized state of two order parameters of opposite glide and screw parity. Discussing the absence of PDM in the bulk where both glide and screw symmetry are present, we argue that the absence of glide symmetry on the surface allows nematic order to selectively stabilize the PDM in thin flakes. Finally, we discuss the symmetry constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism, pointing out the opposite glide and screw parities of the order parameters favor a site, rather than a bond-based paring mechanism. This suggests that pairing in iron-based superconductors may be local to the iron atoms, possibly driven by Hunds coupling."

      "summary": "We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of carbon self-interstitial defects in diamond, ranging from mono- to hexa-interstitial complexes. By quantum mechanical density functional theory, empowered by interatomic potential models, we efficiently sample the complex configurational landscape and identify both known and previously unreported defect geometries. Our results reveal a pronounced energetic driving force for aggregation: the formation energy per interstitial decreases systematically from isolated split interstitials to compact multi-interstitial clusters, with the tetra-interstitial platelet emerging as a particularly stable structural motif. Additionally, charge analysis indicates that the predominantly covalent bonding in diamond becomes more polar within the defect centers. Analysis of defect energy levels shows that only the investigated mono-, di-, penta-, and hexa-interstitial complexes introduce in-gap electronic states, whereas the tri- and tetra-interstitial clusters are electronically inert. Vibrational spectroscopies further reveal that self-interstitials generate characteristic signatures. Short carbon-carbon bonds inside the defect cores give rise to high-frequency vibrational modes between 1375 and 1925 cm$^{-1}$, which are strongly IR-active but exhibit weak Raman activity. Taken together, these findings provide a coherent picture of the structural, electronic, and vibrational characteristics of carbon self-interstitials and establish a robust framework for their experimental identification."

      "summary": "This article reviews recent theoretical developments in the ab initio study of polarons in materials. The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics."

      "summary": "This paper presents physical modeling and benchmarking for two-terminal spin-orbit torque magnetic random-access memory (2T-SOT-MRAM). The results indicate that the common SOT materials that provide only in-plane torque can provide little to no improvement over spin-transfer-torque (STT) MRAM in terms of write energy. However, emerging SOT materials that provide out-of-plane torques with efficiencies as small as 0.1 can result in significant improvements in the write energy for such 2-terminal devices, especially when the magnet lateral dimensions are scaled down to 30 or 20 nm. Additionally, a novel 2T-SOT MRAM device is proposed that can increase the path electrons pass through the SOT layer; hence, increasing the generated spin current and the energy efficiency of the device. Our benchmarking results indicate that an out-of-plane SOT efficiency of 0.051 for 20nm wide devices can result in write energies approaching SRAM at the 7nm technology node."

It stems from previously neglected terms in the derivation of the stochastic projective Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE), accounting for a nonlinear evaporation of particles from the coherent into the incoherent region. We demonstrate that the mechanism, while so far assumed to be of minor importance, is comparable in strength to the widely employed number damping. We also provide a simplified (pseudo)-local and a dimensionally reduced form of this evaporative damping. The process completes the SPGPE description of ultracold Bose gases giving a full first-principles picture of their evolution at finite temperature."

However, a systematic approach to quantify such responses remains lacking. Here, we propose a protocol that maps the shear effect induced by an active agent to oscillatory shear rheometry. The central idea is to establish a correspondence between the mean shear rate generated by swimming and that produced by an oscillating plate. In this mapping, the swimming velocity and active stress are translated into an effective oscillation frequency and strain amplitude. The resulting viscoelastic response can then be evaluated by standard oscillatory rheometry. The protocol is validated using lattice Boltzmann simulations of a squirmer embedded in polymer solutions. Our framework is generic and can be naturally extended to active microrheology, providing a pathway to quantify swimmer-induced viscoelasticity."

Early NPD measurements on the monoclinic phase Cr$_3$Te$_4$ ($x=0.5$) presented evidence for competing FM and AFM phases. Here we apply neutron diffraction to a single crystal of Cr$_{3+\\delta}$Te$_4$ with $\\delta=-0.10$ and discover that it consists of two distinct monoclinic phases, one with FM order below $T_{\\rm C} \\approx 321$ K and another that develops AFM order below $T_{\\rm N} \\approx 86$ K. In contrast, we find that a crystal with $\\delta=-0.26$ exhibits only FM order. The single-crystal analysis is complemented by results obtained with NPD, XPD, and TEM measurements on the $\\delta=-0.10$ composition. From observations of spontaneous magnetostriction of opposite sign at $T_{\\rm C}$ and $T_{\\rm N}$, along with the TEM evidence for both monoclinic phases in a single thin ($\\approx$ 100 nm) grain, we conclude that the two phases must have a fine-grained ($\\lesssim$ 100 nm) intergrowth character, as might occur from high-temperature spinodal decomposition during the growth process. Calculations of the relaxed lattice structures for the FM and AFM phases with DFT provide a rationalization of the observed spontaneous magnetostrictions. Correlations between the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic moments with lattice parameter variation demonstrate that the magnetic orders are sensitive to strain, thus explaining why magnetic ordering temperatures and anisotropies can be different between bulk and thin-film samples, when the latter are subject to epitaxial strain. Our results point to the need to investigate the supposed coexistence FM and AFM phases reported elsewhere in the Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ system, such as in the Cr$_5$Te$_8$ phase ($x=0.25$)."

In WSe$_2$ two different twist angles were studied, 3.65{\\deg} and 5.0{\\deg}, and two seemingly distinct superconducting phase diagrams were reported, raising the question of whether the superconducting phases in the two devices share a similar origin. Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65{\\deg} and 5{\\deg}, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases. More broadly, the smooth phase diagram evolution, repeatability between different devices, and dynamic gate tunability within each device, establish twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a unique platform for the study of correlated phases as the ratio of interaction strength to bandwidth is varied."

We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in deuterated naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of approximately $1~\\mu\\mathrm{T}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution.

A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\\pi$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and N\\'eel ordered states in the three-color $\\pi$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger N\\'eel ordering on the $\\pi$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and N\\'eel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and N\\'eel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle."

      "summary": "As data-centric computing advances, energy-efficient interconnects are increasingly critical for AI-driven systems. Traditional metal conductors face severe limitations at nanoscale due to increased resistivity from surface scattering. In response, this study demonstrates the first wafer-scale realization of an amorphous topological semimetal, tantalum phosphide (TaP), grown directly on amorphous SiO2 substrates (without any seed layers) using low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD). The resulting TaP films exhibit unconventional resistivity scaling: decreasing resistivity with decreasing thickness, reaching 227 micro-ohm cm at ~2.3 nm film thickness. This behavior, observed without crystalline order or seed layers, indicates dominant surface conduction and establishes ALD-TaP as a promising candidate for back-end-of-line integration. The films also show excellent conformality, stoichiometry control, and thermal stability up to 600 degree C. A two-channel conduction model confirms surface-dominated transport in ultrathin regimes, further supported by enhanced conductivity in multi-stacked configurations. These findings highlight the potential of amorphous topological semimetals for future high-density, low-power electronic interconnects and expand the applicability of ALD for integrating novel quantum materials at scale."

The parameters of the electronic system in such a state are studied: electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter with the electronic temperatures up to ~25,000 K. It is also demonstrated that the two refractory alloys do not show signs of nonthermal melting up to the deposited doses of ~10 eV/atom, making them more radiation resistant than the Cantor alloy or stainless steel. These results suggest that heavy-element high-entropy alloys are more radiation resistant than those containing only lighter elements. Damage in irradiated HfNbTaTiZr starts with the selective diffusion of Ti atoms, forming a transient superionic-like state."

However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moir\\'e superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moir\\'e-engineered 2D systems."

The in-situ writing, erasing, and rewriting of ambipolar doping of nanoscale patterns was directly visualized by scanning microwave impedance microscopy.

These capabilities allow on-demand realization of high performance logic, including CMOS inverters with high voltage gains and low power consumption, as well as NAND-to-NOR transitions on the same device via direct polarity rewriting.

      "summary": "We investigate an S=3/2 quantum spin model on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice that continuously interpolates between two paradigmatic quantum disordered states with distinct entanglement structures: the Kitaev quantum spin liquid and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) valence bond solid. Combining classical, semi-classical, and exact diagonalization approaches, we map out the ground-state phase diagram and elucidate the role of quantum fluctuations across the entire parameter range. While classical and semi-classical frameworks predict noncoplanar orders competing with a collinear N\\'eel state, we find these phases to be fragile: once full quantum fluctuations are included, they melt into a quantum-entangled state characterized by suppressed spin correlations and enhanced entanglement entropy. Our findings highlight how competition between qualitatively different quantum disordered phases provides a fertile playground for unconventional phases emerging from their interplay and quantum fluctuations."

By comparing different cases, we show that SOC induces two opposing effects on anomalous quantum oscillations: it suppresses the oscillations in the clean case, while enhancing them in the disordered case. Using an effective model, we analyze in detail the origins of anomalous oscillations in both clean and disordered cases. Based on these origins, we explain why SOC suppresses or enhances the anomalous oscillations in different cases, thereby extending the understanding of the conventional theory. Moreover, in the disordered case, SOC can induce a phase shift of the anomalous oscillations. We further identify a parameter window where the anomalous oscillations are significantly enhanced in the presence of both disorder and SOC. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the role of SOC in anomalous quantum oscillations."

A broad range of utilities with decent synthetic plausibility have made this family a sweet spot to dive into, whereas the underlying analytical aspects are yet to have prominence. Recently, using the machinaries of first principles, we reported a family of six different structures C3NX with a unique dumbbell-shaped morphology, functionalizing the recently synthesized monolayer of C3N. Here we have critically explored the non-trivial topological phases of the semimetallic Dumbbell C3NX sheets and nanoribbons. Spin-orbit coupling induced gap across the Fermi level, its subsequent tuning via an external electric field, portrayal of band inversion from the Berry curvature distribution and the evaluation of topological index using the Wannier charge center (WCC) firmly establishes the traces of topological footprint. The real space decimation scheme and Green function technique evaluate the underlying spectral information with corresponding transport characteristics. Fascinating features of these quasi-1D systems are observed utilizing the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model where different twisted phases reveal distinct topological signatures even in a low atomic mass system like DB C4N."

In the presence of short-range impurities and in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the orbital relaxation emerges from the competition between momentum scattering and the effect of the crystal field. In the case of weak disorder, the orbital relaxation time is proportional to the momentum scattering time: each scattering event contributes to destroying the orbital moment. In the case of strong disorder, the effect of the crystal field is averaged out, and the orbital relaxation time is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering. We finally find that the dipolar and quadrupolar orbital moments are coupled by the crystal field, resulting in a complex dynamical behavior upon orbital injection."

In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales."

Using a momentum-space lattice model and linear-response theory, we investigate a $d$-wave altermagnet coupled to a topological insulator and highlight the crucial role of spin-flip tunneling in shaping its electronic and transport properties. Interfacial hybridization strongly modifies the band structure, leading to anisotropic Rashba-Edelstein and Hall responses. The spin-flip component of the coupling induces an inverse $d$-wave spin texture in the altermagnetic bands, signaling the onset of an altermagnetic topological phase. This coupling also renders the Rashba-Edelstein effect strongly in-plane anisotropic, enhancing the transverse response relative to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic analogues. These results establish interfacial spin-flip tunneling as a practical control knob for direction-sensitive, stray-field-free spin-charge conversion in correlated topological heterostructures."

Here, we find that circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling the development of altermagnets beyond these constraints. Based on symmetrical analysis, our revealments indicate that A-AFM bilayer building-blocks with inversion symmetry exhibit altermagnetism robust to stacking sliding and variations of illumination directions. These bilayers can be constructed from arbitrary ferromagnetic monolayers and guided by the $d$-electron counting rule. Adopting bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a template, out-of-plane illumination with CPL reveals an $f$-wave altermagnetic feature at sliding positions $\\left\\{E|\\left(0,0\\right)\\right\\}$, $\\left\\{E|\\left(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{E|\\left(\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right\\}$, while a $p$-wave feature is predicted at other sliding positions.

The thermalization appears due to a variety of interactions between countries with conservation of two integrals being total GDP and probability (norm). In such a case there is an emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans condensation at states with low GDP. This phenomenon has been studied theoretically and experimentally in multimode optical fibers and we argue that it is at the origin of emergence of poverty and oligarchic phases for GDP of countries. A similar phenomenon has been discussed recently in the framework of the Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis to explain the high inequality of wealth distribution in human society and companies at Stock Exchange markets. We show that the Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization well describes the GDP distribution during the last 50 years."

In this work, we address this apparent discrepancy through an STM study of a twisted monolayer of CrCl3 on Au(111). We observe the coexistence of several moir\\'e patterns at a fixed twist angle, whose relative intensity depends on the tunneling bias. Fourier analysis of STM data uncovers hidden higher-order moir\\'e components not visible in STM topographic images, while spectroscopy maps reveal that the spectral weight of each pattern varies with electron energy. Our results establish that STM selectively probes on the same area distinct moir\\'e modulations depending on electronic confinement, providing a unified framework that reconciles real space and reciprocal space observations of complex moir\\'e superstructures."

While this growth method ensures high productivity and low operation costs compared to other methods, its most significant disadvantage lies in the presence of carbon atoms in the precursors, which are unavoidably incorporated into the epitaxial layers and hamper the performance of most types of fabricated devices. Carbon-free precursors for the CVD process could enhance the performance of high-frequency and high-power nitride-based devices while maintaining growth capability in industrial equipment. In this work, we implement gallium- and aluminum-brominated precursors, which contain no carbon atoms, to grow GaN and AlN layers in an industrial CVD system.

Moreover, the robustness of the extended states has been checked in presence of diagonal disorder and off-diagonal anisotropy. Flux modulated single-particle mobility edge is characterized through mutlifractal analysis. Quantum interference is the essential issue, reported here, that manipulates the kinematics of the excitation and this is manifested by the workout of persistent current."

      "summary": "Research on strongly correlated electron systems faces a fundamental challenge due to the complex nature of intrinsic many-body correlations. A key strategy to address this challenge lies in advancing experimental methods that can directly probe and elucidate the underlying many-body correlations. In this perspective article, we discuss the theoretically proposed coincidence detection techniques, which are designed to directly measure two-body correlations in various particle-particle and particle-hole channels, with momentum, energy, and/or spatial resolution. We also explore the prospects of these coincidence detection techniques for future theoretical and experimental developments. The successful implementation and refinement of these coincidence detection techniques promise to deliver powerful new approaches for unraveling long-standing puzzles in strongly correlated electron systems, such as the enigmatic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity and the long-sought quantum spin liquids. Furthermore, these coincidence detection techniques will offer powerful new methods to investigate novel phenomena like itinerant magnetism and electronic nematicity in quantum materials."

Here we conduct a systematic investigation of magnetization in hole-doped quartic dispersion materials (GaS, InSe, TiO$_{2}$), focusing on the effects of structural confinement from 2D monolayers to quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons (NRs). Upon hole doping, these NRs develop itinerant magnetization across a broad range of carrier densities and display half-metallic behavior. The spin-polarization energies ($E_{sp}$) of these NRs enhance remarkably relative to their 2D counterparts, with maximum increase being in the case of TiO$_{2}$ from 31 to 103 meV/carrier. The $E_{sp}$ strongly depends on the degree of localization of the magnetic moments along the width of NRs, which is determined by edge passivation and ribbon width. Strong deformation of the topmost valence bands at higher dopings indicates deviation from the Stoner mechanism."

      "summary": "I investigate the compression-driven jamming behavior of two-dimensional porous aggregates composed of cohesive, frictionless disks. Three types of initial aggregates are prepared using different aggregation procedures, namely, reaction-limited aggregation (RLA), ballistic particle-cluster aggregation (BPCA), and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), to elucidate the influence of aggregate morphology. Using distinct-element-method simulations with a shrinking circular boundary, I numerically obtain the pressure as a function of the packing fraction $\\phi$. For the densest RLA and the intermediate BPCA aggregates, a clear jamming transition is observed at a critical packing fraction $\\phi_{\\rm J}$, below which the pressure vanishes and above which a finite pressure emerges; the transition is less distinct for the most porous DLA aggregates. The jamming threshold depends on the initial structure and, when extrapolated to infinite system size, approaches $\\phi_{\\rm J} = 0.765 \\pm 0.004$ for RLA, $0.727 \\pm 0.004$ for BPCA, and $0.602 \\pm 0.023$ for DLA, where the errors denote the standard error. Above $\\phi_{\\rm J}$, the pressure follows $P \\approx A {( \\phi - \\phi_{\\rm J} )}^{2}$, which implies that the bulk modulus $K$ of jammed aggregates is proportional to $\\phi - \\phi_{\\rm J}$. Rigid-cluster analysis of jammed aggregates shows that the average coordination number within the largest rigid cluster increases linearly with $\\phi - \\phi_{\\rm J}$. Taken together, these relations suggest that the elastic response of compressed porous aggregates is analogous to that of random spring networks."

In particular, freestanding membranes suffer from slow sacrificial layer removal and interfacial strain, while neuromorphic hardware often relies on area-intensive dual-device schemes for bipolar synaptic weights. Here, we present a universal strategy based on water-soluble Sr4Al2O7 sacrificial layers, enabling the rapid release of freestanding ferrimagnetic metal membranes, which exhibit deterministic spin-orbit torque switching characteristics with well-preserved perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and are potential for next-generation ultrafast information technology. Extending this approach, we realize single-device ferrimagnetic synapses exhibiting intrinsic bipolar resistive switching. When implemented in a ResNet-18 architecture, these devices achieve 92% accuracy on CIFAR-10 - comparable to floating-point software models - while halving device counts relative to differential-pair implementations. These results establish a scalable platform linking flexible spintronics with compact, high-performance neuromorphic systems, offering foundational advances for next-generation electronics and brain-inspired hardware."

However, thin sheets have been theoretically predicted to spontaneously transition from a flat to a crumpled state driven by thermal fluctuations, a phenomenon that has been elusive in experiments. We report the first observation of a similar crumpling transition driven instead by surface energy. Using a sensitive experimental protocol, when we gently compress a thin polymer sheet weakly adhered to a hydrogel substrate it transitions to a self-crumpling state at a well defined critical compression independent of system details. The transition is marked by the percolation of a fold network, and a power law increase in fold density. Most remarkably, the crumpled state shows a tunable order of folds establishing the phenomenon's potential as a simple and scalable technique to do origami with extremely thin sheets."

However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators."

These objects are discontinuities of the spin chain protected by the properties of the global system leading to a quantum many-body multiplet protected from the environment decoherence. Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the homogeneous broadening is governed by the intra-chain dipolar field, and we establish design principles for optimizing coherence in future materials."

Here, we determine the surface tension by analyzing the spatial distribution of forces at the molecular level in a slab-confined system of ABPs exhibiting high and low density regions separated by a one-dimensional active interface. Unlike previous approaches that evaluate active and interaction stresses independently - often producing near-zero or negative surface tension - we show that on average, interaction forces act antagonistically to active propulsion, reducing the net force experienced by particles. By evaluating the work required to bring a particle to the interface using this total-force framework, we find a positive and physically consistent surface tension. These results reframe the mechanical interpretation of local stresses and provide a generalizable method for connecting microscopic force distributions to emergent interfacial properties in nonequilibrium systems."

In this study, the work function change in the $\\alpha$-NPD/HAT-CN/Au interface was measured as a typical donor/acceptor system using a rotary Kelvin probe (RKP). Our findings demonstrate good agreement with simulations only at metal/organic interfaces which have \"active\" charge transfer. It is suggested that thermal equilibrium is not achieved simply by depositing the film under dark condition, and some treatment to supply carriers, such as exposure to UV light, is necessary for accurate evaluation. At the organic/organic interface, the the experimental results did not agree with thermal equilibrium model, highlighting the need to consider substrate-driven carrier supply and polarization effects when evaluating energy level alignment."

Complete suppression of the Pb4S3Cl2 domain growth was then achieved by additionally selecting an appropriate sulfur source (bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide, which also acted as scavenger of Cl$^-$ ions), and reaction temperature. In the heterostructures, emission from the perovskite domain was quenched, while emission from the PbS domain was observed, pointing to a type-I band alignment, as confirmed by calculations. These heterostructures in turn could be exploited to prepare second-generation heterostructures through selective ion exchange on the individual domains (halide ion exchange on CsPbCl3, cation exchange on PbS).

While mixed Cl-Br or Br-I alloy compositions can be formed with no miscibility gaps, this is precluded for mixed Cl-I compositions, due to the large difference in Cl and I ionic radii. Here, we exploit perovskite-chalcohalide CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures to study the Cl-I exchange and isolate new types of intermediate structures. The epitaxial interface between the Pb4S3Cl2 chalcohalide and the CsPbCl3 perovskite domain significantly influences the intermediate stages of halide exchange in the perovskite domain, leading to coexisting CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 domains, thereby delivering segmented CsPbI3-CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 energetically favorable heterostructures, with partial iodide alloying of the CsPbCl3 domain and at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. The I:CsPbCl3 domain between CsPbI3 and Pb4S3Cl2 enables a gradual lattice expansion across the heterostructure. This design accommodates interfacial strain, with a 5.6% mismatch at the CsPbCl3-CsPbI3 interface and a 3.4% mismatch at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. Full halide exchange leads to CsPbI3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures. Both in intermediate and fully exchanged heterostructures, the CsPbI3 domain is emissive. In the intermediate structures, the band alignment between the two perovskite domains is type-I, with carriers photogenerated in the CsPbCl3 domain quickly transferring to the CsPbI3 domain, where they can recombine radiatively."

      "summary": "Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators."

      "summary": "Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) exhibit pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as a result of their heavy metal constituents, leading to distinctive electronic properties such as Rashba type band splitting which make them promising candidates for next generation spintronic applications. Here, using circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and polarization dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we found that spin polarization is present across all phases of our two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) mixed-phase perovskites, (C6H7SNH3)2 (CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n=1-4), irrespective of the number of inorganic layers. The origin of these spin polarized bands is attributed to the Rashba effect. Interestingly, the highly disordered nature of this system facilitates remarkably efficient ultrafast funneling of photoexcited spin-polarized excitons from the pure 2D phase (n=1) to higher-n phases at room temperature. We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering. These findings not only offer valuable guidance for the design of 2D RP perovskites with pronounced Rashba effects but also unveil a compelling class of solution-processed perovskites capable of efficient spin-preserving energy transport at room temperature."

NIR emitting perovskite-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have reached an external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 20% and a device stability of over 10,000 h. Such results have sparked an interest in exploring new NIR metal halide emitters. In this review, we summarize several different types of NIR-emitting metal halides, including lead/tin bromide/iodide perovskites, lanthanide ions doped/based metal halides, double perovskites, low dimensional hybrid and Bi3+/Sb3+/Cr3+ doped metal halides, and assess their recent advancements. The characteristics and mechanisms of narrow-band or broadband NIR luminescence in all these materials are discussed in detail. We also highlight the various applications of NIR-emitting metal halides and provide an outlook for the field."

      "summary": "We report the synthesis of ethylammonium lead iodide (EAPbI3) colloidal nanocrystals as another member of the lead halide perovskites family. The insertion of an unusually large A-cation (274 pm in diameter) in the perovskite structure, hitherto considered unlikely due to the unfavorable Goldschmidt tolerance factor, results in a significantly larger lattice parameter compared to the Cs-, methylammonium- and formamidinium-based lead halide perovskite homologues. As a consequence, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are highly unstable, evolving to a non-perovskite delta-EAPbI3 polymorph within one day. Also, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are very sensitive to electron irradiation and quickly degrade to PbI2 upon exposure to the electron beam, following a mechanism similar to that of other hybrid lead iodide perovskites (although degradation can be reduced by partially replacing the EA+ ions with Cs+ ions). Interestingly, in some cases during this degradation the formation of an epitaxial interface between (EAxCs1-x)PbI3 and PbI2 is observed. The photoluminescence emission of the EAPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals, albeit being characterized by a low quantum yield (around 1%), can be tuned in the 664-690 nm range by regulating their size during the synthesis. The emission efficiency can be improved upon partial alloying at the A site with Cs+ or formamidinium cations. Furthermore, the morphology of the EAPbI3 nanocrystals can be chosen to be either nanocube or nanoplatelet, depending on the synthesis conditions."

Here, we demonstrate nW-scale thermoelectric power generation in devices from thin film assemblies of microwave-synthesized p-Sb2Te3 nanoplates and n-Ag2Te nanowires on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. While microwave cycling is crucial for Ag2Te nanocrystal shaping, Sb2Te3 formation is sensitive to precursors and surfactant concentrations. Introducing S doping in Sb2Te3 in the 1 - 1.5 atomic percent range via thioglycolic acid during synthesis yields an up to eightfold higher power-factor, due to a fivefold increase in electrical conductivity and 25% increase in Seebeck coefficient. Our microfilm devices generate up to 33.6 mV from 5 deg C to 50 deg C thermal gradients, with 120 nW maximum power output at Delta T 30 deg C, which is sixtyfold higher than Sb2Te3 paper devices. Mechanical bending can increase device resistance by up to 125% due to diminished inter-nanostructure electronic transport. These findings provide insights for integrating synthesis, morphology engineering and device design for next-generation wearable thermoelectric systems."

The symmetric sector corresponds to a reversible dynamics and yields a nonlocal Fisher information governing free-energy decay, whereas the anti-symmetric sector generates a canonical conservative flow that produces circulation but no dissipation.

      "summary": "Topological quasiparticles, such as merons and bimerons, are characterized by non-trivial textures that exhibit remarkably robust transport against deformation, offering significant potential for information processing. While these phenomena have been explored in various systems, acoustic realizations remain challenging. Here, we report that acoustic meron topological textures were successfully realized using designed Archimedeanlike square spiral metastructures via the excitation of spoof surface acoustic waves (SSAWs). By applying mirror-symmetric combinatorial operations to the unit structures, we further construct composite chiral metastructures that enable both one-dimensional and two-dimensional stable transport of acoustic bimerons. It is further revealed that bimeron transport originates from the locked opposite phase differences of SSAWs, induced by the handedness of the cavity resonant modes. The intrinsic robustness of the meron textures against structural defects is confirmed through the calculation of their topological charge. Our findings establish stable acoustic bimeron transport as a topologically resilient foundation for future acoustic information processing and storage technologies."

In particular, electron or hole doping of the sample layer is heralded by a strong frequency shift and loss of transition strength of 2s excitons in the sensor layer; these features have been attributed to the formation of a bound state of a 2s exciton and a remote electron. Through a theoretical analysis of exciton-electron scattering, we show that the experimental spectra can only be explained by electron-mediated hybridization of 2s, 2p and interlayer excitons, leading to a new type of many-body state which we term Rydberg attractive polaron. We anticipate that this new understanding will ensure a more accurate assessment of the signatures of correlated electrons in two dimensional materials."

      "summary": "Insomuch as statistical mechanics circumvents the formidable task of addressing many-body dynamics, it remains a challenge to derive macroscopic properties from a solution to Hamiltonian equations for microscopic motion of an isolated system. Launching new attacks on this long-standing problem -- part of Hilbert's sixth problem -- is urgently important, for focus of statistical phenomena is shifting from a fictitious ensemble to an individual member, i.e. a mechanically isolated system. Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume. Our findings may have applications in nonlinear optics and cold-atom dynamics."

These attributes make GeSn a promising platform for scalable sensing, imaging, and communication technologies. Yet, the influence of dimensionality on GeSn crystal growth remains poorly understood, limiting the development of integrated nanoscale infrared devices. Here, we reveal the spontaneous formation of hitherto unreported ultra-thin GeSn fins with sub-30 nm thickness during vapor-phase growth on Ge nanowire substrates. A transition from the typical conformal GeSn shell to distinct fin-like structures occurs along the nanowire growth axis and is accompanied by ordered twin defects extending longitudinally and laterally, inducing a transition from diamond to hexagonal-like crystal structure. The fins exhibit uniform Sn incorporation of approximately 16 at.% throughout their volume, indicating high compositional homogeneity. These findings uncover an anisotropic growth regime in metastable GeSn alloys, enriching the fundamental understanding of nanoscale epitaxy."

Our simulations show the formation of a wetting layer rich in the preferred $A$-type particles and bicontinuous domain morphology in the bulk. In addition, the mixture maintains connectivity between the bulk and the wetting layer through $A$-rich tubes throughout the depletion region. The wetting layer thickness coarsens as a power law, $R_1(t)\\sim t^{\\alpha}$, with two distinct growth regimes of $\\alpha=1/3$ and $\\alpha=1$ active for at least a decade. The computed crossover time for $\\alpha=1/3 \\to 1$ equaled the reported bulk crossover time, and the corresponding crossover length scale $R_c$ agrees well with the expression $\\Lambda = \\sqrt{2k/\\gamma_0}$ given by Scholten et al.~[\\emph{Macromolecules}2005, 38, 3515] for bicontinuous domains in aqueous polymer mixtures in the presence of only one dominant length scale. This agreement supports a hydrodynamic picture of diffusive growth for the interconnected wetting layer and bulk domains, where the bending contribution ($k$) of curvature-dependent $AB$ interfacial tension ($\\gamma$) governs small-scale coarsening, producing $t^{1/3}$ growth. For length scales beyond $\\Lambda$, capillary flows yield the viscous hydrodynamic regime ($\\sim t$). Our results show no orientational effects on the domain coarsening parallel and perpendicular to the wall, contrasting many continuum models, including combinations with Flory-Huggins theory."

      "summary": "Understanding how dielectric anisotropy governs excitonic behavior in two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites is critical for predicting and engineering their optoelectronic properties. In this work, we investigate Cs(n+1)PbnBr3n+1 nanoplatelets (n = 2-5) experimentally and theoretically and show that the interplay between dielectric confinement and anisotropic screening critically determines both their electronic structure and excitonic landscape. To incorporate the dielectric screening effects, the Coulomb kernel in the Fock exchange term is refined using a model dielectric function together with a model Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach. The exciton binding energies show a monotonic decrease from 0.26 eV to 0.21 eV from n = 2 to 5, with 20 meV decrease per layer up to n = 4, and thereafter less change. The relatively small change per layer is a consequence of the strong spatial localization of excitons. By analyzing directionally resolved dielectric tensors, we demonstrate that the in-plane dielectric constant predominantly dictates optical transitions and is close to converging to the bulk value already at n = 5, while the out-of-plane dielectric response reflects the confined nature of excitonic wave functions as expected. Our calculated absorption spectra capture experimental results within 0.02 eV throughout the confinement regime (n = 2-5). The effects of lattice dynamics on the dimensionally dependent dielectric response and subsequent exciton screening occurring on longer time-scales than the optical response are also analyzed, important for analysis and interpretation of exciton lifetime, diffusion, and band alignments. The results establish a clear correlation between dielectric anisotropy, electronic structure, and exciton binding energy at different timescales in layered perovskites, providing essential insight for the design of 2D optoelectronic materials and devices."

Here, we combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and heat transport in $\\rm LiYTiO_4$. We employ a neural evolution potential (NEP)-based framework that integrates the temperature-dependent effective potential method with the Wigner thermal transport (WTT) formalism, explicitly including both diagonal and off-diagonal terms of the heat-flux operator. Zero-temperature phonon calculations reveal dynamical instabilities associated with $\\rm TiO_6$ octahedral rotation, which are stabilized at finite temperatures through anharmonic renormalization.

Using dynamical mean-field theory, we describe the many-species system in terms of single-species dynamics with demographic and environmental noises. We show that the single-species model features a random mass term, or equivalently a random space-time averaged growth rate, poising some species very close to extinction. This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free. We argue that these correlations are described by exponents derived from those of directed percolation in spatial dimension $d=3$, but not in lower dimensions."

      "summary": "Remote epitaxy relaxes the constraints of conventional epitaxy, to enable low defect density, chemically abrupt heterostructures and exfoliation of single crystalline membranes. However, definitive evidence for a true remote mechanism remains elusive because most experiments can be explained by alternative mechanism that are macroscopically indistinguishable from true remote epitaxy. Using GdAuGe films grown on graphene/SiC (0001), we present two signatures that cannot be explained by the leading alternatives to the remote mechanism: (1) a few atomic layer thick disordered interlayer at the GdAuGe/graphene interface and (2) a $30\\degree$ rotated epitaxial relationship between the GdAuGe film and the SiC substrate. Density functional theory calculations indicate these signatures arise from remote epitaxial \\textit{frustration}, a competition amongst epitaxy to the remotely screened substrate, to graphene, and to the graphene-induced interfacial reconstruction. Tuning the amplitudes and periodicities of these competing potentials provides new opportunities to intentionally disrupt long-range order."

      "summary": "Nonlinear transport has emerged as a powerful approach to probe the quantum geometry of electronic wavefunctions, such as Berry curvature and quantum metric, in topological materials. While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials."

      "summary": "The structure and transport of electrolytes in nanoscale channels are known to be affected by the electronic properties of the confining walls. This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics."

      "summary": "We investigate how symmetry, exact coherent structures (ECSs), and their invariant manifolds organize spontaneous flow reversals in a 2D active nematic confined to a periodic channel. In minimal flow units commensurate with the intrinsic active vortex scale, we use equivariant bifurcation theory to trace the origin of dynamically relevant ECSs via a sequence of symmetry-constrained local and global bifurcations. At low activity level, we identify relative periodic orbits, created via a sequence of SNIPER, homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, whose invariant manifolds provide robust heteroclinic pathways between left- and right-flowing nearly uniaxial states. These result in several symmetry-dictated reversal mechanisms in the preturbulent regime, with and without vortex-lattice intermediate states. In the active turbulent regime, this ECS skeleton persists and organizes chaotic attractors exhibiting persistent two-way reversals. By classifying ECSs through their symmetry signatures, we relate a small set of ECSs embedded in turbulence back to the preturbulent branches, and show that typical turbulent trajectories repeatedly shadow these ECSs and their unstable manifolds, resulting in near-heteroclinic transitions between opposite-flow states. Our results establish that channel confined active nematic turbulence is organized by a low-dimensional, symmetry-governed network of invariant solutions and their manifolds, and identify dynamical mechanisms that could be exploited to design, promote, or suppress flow reversals in active matter microfluidic devices."

However, the underlying spin dynamics, and the mechanisms determining the spin-dependent fluorescence in these defects are still poorly understood. In this work we perform detailed photodynamical studies of the spin complexes in hBN. In particular, we show that spin transitions are located within the metastable manifold which can be explained by the rate model, populating in a cascading manner. In addition, we perform temperature dependent measurements on these defects and show that the spin-lattice relaxation and coherence times increase as the temperature reduces. Furthermore, we find that the ODMR frequencies of the S=1 transition show only a marginal frequency shift as a function of temperature, which makes them a robust sensor at cryogenic temperatures. These insights are crucial for further understanding of the spin dynamics of quantum emitters in hBN and their practical implementation in quantum sensing."

      "summary": "Whether orbital polarization propagates has become the most essential question of the blooming orbitronics that aims to generate non-local orbital torque and orbital pumping. Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation. The experimental evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization represents a groundbreaking advance towards solving the essential orbital torque debate."

      "summary": "Periodic boundary condition (PBC) is a standard approximation for calculating crystalline materials properties. However, a PBC crystal is not the same as the real macroscopic crystal, therefore, if applied indiscriminately, it can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, unlike other extensive observables such as total energy, the polarization of a macroscopic crystal cannot always be described by a PBC model, because polarization is inherently nonlocal and strongly dependent on surface terminations, irrespective of crystal size, and moreover, the symmetry of the macroscopic crystal can be altered when the PBC is applied to a macroscopic crystal. We demonstrate in this paper that the polarization of a macroscopic crystal receives contributions from both the repeating bulk units and the crystal surfaces, which must be treated on an equal footing. When the combined system of the bulk and its surfaces are taken into account, materials traditionally classified as nonpolar can, in fact, admit polar symmetry, thus explaining why experimentalists have observed polarization in some nominally ``nonpolar'' systems. Our study, thus, clarifies that polarization can only exist in polar group systems and that apparent violations of Neumann's principle reported in some recent works originate from misinterpreting bulk PBC crystal as intrinsic macroscopic crystal, ignoring the contribution from the surfaces. We demonstrate that when the full bulk-plus-surface system is considered, the crystal polarization and symmetry is fully consistent with Neumann's principle."

Here we provide the first experimental evidence that lonsdaleite does in fact host photoluminescent color centres. In meteoritic lonsdaleite grains from the ureilite NWA7983, we identify a new defect, RU1, which exhibits bright and stable emission across 550-800 nm, with optimal blue excitation (~455 nm) and a peak at ~700 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals an excited-state lifetime of 14 ns with no detectable blinking, bleaching, or charge conversion. From the excitation-emission energetics we infer an unresolved zero-phonon line near 550 nm. Correlative electron microscopy confirms the lonsdaleite host lattice, and compositional analysis suggests N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents. These results suggest lonsdaleite could become a new quantum-grade crystalline platform and indicate that hexagonal-diamond color centres may form a new and unexplored family of solid-state quantum emitters."

Here we propose that a concentration gradient, which often persists as a quasi-stable nonequilibrium state with long relaxation times in solids, can serve as a general platform for inversion symmetry breaking. We demonstrate this concept in an epitaxial thin film of the hydrogen-doped SmFeAsO (Sm1111:H) superconductor with a depthwise hydrogen-concentration gradient introduced via an optimized topotactic reaction. This film exhibits nonreciprocal charge transport, meaning that the electrical resistance depends on the direction of the applied current, which serves as a key signature of broken inversion symmetry. A pronounced nonreciprocal signal emerges in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, which we attribute to vortex-motion nonreciprocity arising from an asymmetric pinning landscape created by the hydrogen-concentration gradient. Owing to the high critical temperature of Sm1111:H, vortex-origin nonreciprocity is observed above 40 K, representing the highest temperature reported to date among single bulk materials without an artificially hetero-layered structure. Our findings establish concentration-gradient engineering as a versatile and broadly applicable route for realizing inversion-broken states in otherwise centrosymmetric hosts, opening pathways toward a broader landscape of odd-parity-driven functionalities."

A striking and unresolved puzzle from these studies is the unexpected opposite sign of the observed Chern numbers between the two systems. Recent theory has proposed a twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in both twisted MoTe2 and WSe2, offering a potential explanation for the disparate experimental observations6. However, a direct experimental verification of the twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in a specific twisted TMD homobilayer is still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration that the Chern numbers of the moire frontier bands undergo sign reversal at a critical twist angle 1.42{deg} in twisted WSe2 bilayers (tWSe2). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we direct measure layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tWSe2 and our results reveal that tWSe2 in the vicinity of the 1.42{deg} exhibits a twist-angle-dependent layer-pseudospin polarization, an effect that serves as the fundamental origin of the observed Chern number sigh reversal6-12."

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."

      "summary": "The interplay between charge-density waves (CDWs), which break translational symmetry, and spatially homogeneous superconductivity, which breaks global U(1) gauge symmetry, can give rise to an intriguing phenomenon: the pair-density wave, characterized by a spatial modulation of the superconducting order parameter. Yet how CDWs couple to unconventional superconducting states-particularly those with time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB)-remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy on heavily hole-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, which hosts an s $\\pm$ is superconducting state, we reveal a previously unobserved coupling between a surface CDW and TRSB superconductivity. Experimentally, the TRSB superconductivity imparts \"chirality\" to the CDW, which manifests as commensurate domains separated by domain walls with $\\pi$-phase slips-forming what we term a bipolar CDW. The domain walls delineate TRSB domains of opposite chirality, consistent with spontaneous breaking of U(1) $\\times$ Z2. Supported by theoretical modelling, we construct a framework in which a hidden interfacial pair-density modulation (PDM) mediates a linear coupling between the surface CDW and interband Josephson currents of TRSB superconductivity. Crucially, the theory shows that realizing this linear coupling requires a controlled global phase difference $\\delta$ $\\phi$ = $\\pi$/2 between the PDM and CDW states. Our results uncover a previously overlooked connection between charge ordering and TRSB superconductivity, opening a pathway to explore intertwined quantum orders in iron-based superconductors and other strongly correlated systems."

They are obtained numerically by analyzing with the Pauli Master Equation, the self-consistent imaginary part data of the elastic-scattering cross-section. We use a two-component irreducible representation of the order parameter with quasi-point nodes and study the quasi-classical effective probabilistic density distribution as function of disorder. We find a stable coherent quantum state of dressed fermions, and slow characteristic decay time for dilute disorder. Also, we find an incoherent quantum state with diffused dressed fermions and enriched disorder with self-consistency increasing decoherence, a fast characteristic decay time, and a diffuse unitary resonance. We conclude that the most stable dressed fermion states are those in which the field has dilute disorder, the threshold zero gap, and some dressed fermions behave like an s-wave superconductor, showing a tiny gap."

Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B alloys were fabricated; scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed a compressive strain of up to 25% near grain boundaries. Using the full-potential Korringa--Kohn--Rostoker method, we calculated the strain dependence of $K_{\\rm u}$, showing that although $K_{\\rm u}$ is 4.2 MJ/m$^3$ under strain-free conditions at 0 K, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain. Additionally, Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B exhibits a larger $K_{\\rm u}$ than Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B under undistorted conditions, whereas Pr-rich alloys exhibit a more pronounced reduction in $K_{\\rm u}$ under strain. These findings highlight the critical influence of lattice distortions on magnetic properties.

However, ensuring permutation, rotation, and periodic translation equivariance during diffusion process remains incompletely addressed. In this work, we propose EquiCSP, a novel equivariant diffusion-based generative model. We not only address the overlooked issue of lattice permutation equivariance in existing models, but also develop a unique noising algorithm that rigorously maintains periodic translation equivariance throughout both training and inference processes. Our experiments indicate that EquiCSP significantly surpasses existing models in terms of generating accurate structures and demonstrates faster convergence during the training process."

Utilizing the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, we derive a set of self-consistent equations that evaluate the excitonic and photonic order parameters in a two-band electronic model, accounting equally for both electron-hole Coulomb attraction and light-matter coupling. Analyzing the competition among these condensate order parameters reveals a complex phase structure of coherent states in the ground state. As the mass imbalance is reduced, we observe a transition from a normal disordered electron-hole-photon system to excitoniclike, polariton, and ultimately photoniclike polariton condensation states. The distinct features of these robust condensates can be identified in the momentum distribution of the electron-hole pair amplitude and the photonic density, as well as in the wave-number-resolved photoemission spectra of electrons, holes, and photons. Increasing the excitation density further expands the range of condensation states. Additionally, lowering the mass imbalance leads to the emergence of quantum coherent bound states prior to the formation of robust condensates, which are evidenced by the static and dynamical excitonic and photonic susceptibility functions."

In experiments, velocity distributions are typically obtained by particle tracking, which however becomes limited at moderate and high particle densities. As a way forward, we propose a new technique for measuring particle velocities in situ by using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, which remains applicable at significantly higher particle densities.The FBG sensor detects strain pulses induced by particle-fiber collisions, from which the velocity of the impacting particle can be derived. Applying this method to an ensemble of granular particles allows to extract its velocity distributions as we present for a granular system excited by a vibrational shaker. We validate the extracted velocity distribution against conventional particle-tracking measurements, confirming the reliability of the FBG-based technique."

We introduce the edge-aware graph attention model, a physics-informed graph neural network tailored for predicting relaxed atomic structures of high-entropy systems. the edge-aware graph attention model employs chemically and geometrically informed descriptors that capture both atomic properties and local structural environments. To effectively capture atomic interactions, our model integrates a multi-head self-attention mechanism that adaptively weighs neighbouring atoms using both node and edge features. This edge-aware attention framework learn complex chemical and structural relationships independent of global orientation or position. We trained and evaluated the edge-aware GAT model on a dataset of carbide systems, spanning binary to high-entropy carbide compositions, and demonstrated its accuracy, convergence efficiency, and transferability. The architecture is lightweight, with a very low computational footprint, making it highly suitable for large-scale materials screening. By providing invariance to rigid-body transformations and leveraging domain-informed attention mechanisms, our model delivers a fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to DFT, enabling accelerated discovery and screening of entropy-stabilised materials."

      "summary": "Transition metal doping is commonly used for altering the properties of solid-state materials to suit applications in science and technology. Partially filled $d$-shells of transition metal atoms lead to electronic states with diverse spatial and spin symmetries. Chromium(III) cations have shown great potential for designing laser materials and, more recently, for developing spin qubits in quantum applications. They also represent an intriguing class of chemical systems with strongly correlated multi-reference excited states, due to the $d^3$ electron configuration. These states are difficult to describe accurately using single-reference quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT), the most commonly used method to study the electronic structures of solid-state systems. Recently, the periodic effective Hamiltonian of crystal field (pEHCF) method has been shown to overcome some limitations arising in the calculations of excited $d$-states. In this work, we assess the suitability of DFT and pEHCF to calculate the electronic structure and $d$-$d$ excitations of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap host materials. The results will aid computational development of novel transition metal-doped materials and provide a deeper understanding of the complex nature of transition metal dopants in solids."

The source for the salt gradient can be as simple as a dissolving ionic crystal, as shown by McDermott et al. [Langmuir 28, 15491 (2012)]. Trapping is due to a competition between localisation due to diffusiophoresis in the salt gradient, and spreading out by diffusion. The size of the trap is typically 1 to 100 micrometres. We further predict that at steady state, the particle (macromolecule) number density is a power law of the salt concentration, with an exponent that is the ratio of the diffusiophoretic mobility to the diffusion coefficient of the trapped species. This ratio increases with size and typically becomes much greater than 1 for particles or macromolecules with hydrodynamic radii of hundreds of nanometres and above. Thus large particles or macromolecules are easily caught and trapped at steady state by salt gradients."

Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions."

The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity.

Ferroelectric domains can be manipulated using electric fields, thus opening a route for external control over material properties. In this paper we explore the possibility of engineering magneto-electric coupling in ferroelectric heterostructures by studying the interface of bilayer SnTe with iron phthalocyanine molecules as a model system. The molecules act as sensor spins, allowing us to sample the magneto-electric coupling with nanometer precision through scanning tunneling microscopy. Our measurements uncover a structural, and therefore material-independent and intrinsic, mechanism to couple electric and magnetic degrees of freedom at the nanoscale."

This bond order induces a Kekul\\'{e} lattice distortion via electron-phonon coupling.

The dipolar atomic species have permanent magnetic dipolar moments. We employ Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory to investigate the distinct collective spectra at zero and finite temperatures corresponding to phase separation phenomena stemming from the dipole-dipole interaction of dipolar atomic species. When the dipolar interaction is tuned to be repulsive, the number of zero-energy modes decreases, reflecting the system's tendency towards mixing. For a large number of atoms, we show that the attractive (repulsive) dipolar interaction strengths lead to ground states with non-dipolar (dipolar) atomic species at the periphery, and this leads to a discontinuity in quasiparticle mode evolution. We finally reveal that miscibility driven by thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures exhibits dipole mode hardening, confirmed by the loss of long-range phase coherence through the correlation function. The mode mixing in the dispersion relations ascertains a dipolar strength-dependent miscibility transition and the low-lying quasiparticle mode evolution."

In $1T$-TaS$_2$, this competition is tied to a sequence of CDW phases and a hysteretic metal-insulator transition, but details of the transition, especially the role of interlayer coupling, remain unresolved. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges. These results identify the transition in $1T$-TaS$_2$ as a three-dimensional, interlayer-driven percolation process and establish this material as a natural, tunable hyperbolic medium."

These phonons have finite magnetic moment and can couple to internal magnetic order. The rich magnetic structures enable phonon angular momentum (PAM) to acquire momentum-space textures analogous to electronic spin structures. However, a systematic framework for classifying these textures, especially their potential higher-order multipolar patterns, has remained elusive. Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of long-wavelength phonons in collinear magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types, including three families of magneto-axial phonons differentiated by symmetry and the parity (odd or even) of the PAM wave pattern. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from p- to j-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term magneto-alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such magneto-alteraxial phonons. We have also performed ab initio calculations on representative materials to validate the proposed magneto-alteraxial phonon spectra and PAM patterns. Our work establishes a symmetry-guided design principle for axial phonons and related phenomena in magnetic materials."

The present work demonstrates the manifestation of ion migration in two ways via Hoke and Schottky effects. Both effects are induced by external exposure but have its peculiar way of solar cell performance degradation. We demonstrate the effects of ion migration on the device performance by measuring time dependent short-circuit current and different impedance characteristics that allow to see how charge-carrier separation property degrades. The Schottky effect leads to the rapid decrease of charge-carrier separation characteristic of solar cell while Hoke effect leads to the slow defect accumulation in the perovskite layer leading to the enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Separation of these two effects can be realized by simple increase of transport layer thickness. A thick transport layer blocks losses of charge-carrier selectivity in a solar cell and leads to an enormous increase of T80 time, from 15 seconds up to 60 minutes."

We identify common misconceptions in the literature and outline how microscopic dielectric behavior can be coarse-grained to connect with experimental observables. Simulations show that water retains a bulk-like dielectric response down to $\\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ confinement. The reduced \\emph{effective} dielectric response that governs capacitance arises from the placement of the dielectric interface. Using effective-medium theory, we demonstrate that long-range reductions reported in experiments and theory are consistent with bulk-like behavior beyond about $1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ from the surface. The effective response naturally maps onto an interfacial capacitance, and the dielectric properties of simulated water are robust across simulation setups and water models, reflecting universal polarization correlations."

Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations."

Reliable modeling of this process is essential, yet conventional treatments neglect dynamic dielectric effects, limiting the predictive reliability at operating conditions. We develop a general framework that incorporates the frequency-dependent screened Coulomb interaction $W_{00}(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$, computed from low-scaling \\textit{GW}, into both direct and phonon-assisted Auger amplitudes. Demonstrated on orthorhombic $\\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ (band gap $E_g\\approx1.73$ eV) and $\\gamma$-CsSnI$_3$ ($E_g\\approx1.30$ eV), the approach shows that dynamic screening enhances the dielectric response, lowering the room-temperature Auger coefficient by $\\sim$50-60 %. This renormalization shifts the crossover between radiative and nonradiative recombination by nearly a factor of two in carrier density. Dynamic dielectric screening thus emerges as a quantitative determinant of Auger recombination, offering a transferable framework for predictive modeling across polar semiconductors where frequency-independent screening models are inadequate."

      "summary": "The pair-density-wave (PDW) is an exotic pairing state hosting a spatially modulated pairing order parameter, which has attracted great interest. Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D. Our work appeals for experimental verifications."

Using electrochemistry, the quantum dot films show state-resolved mobility, state-resolved electron filling, and intraband absorption in the 3-8 micron range. The InAs/ZnSe films need a more reducing potential than InAs, but the InAs/InP films need a lower reduction potential. As a result, we found that dry films of InAs/InP dots show stable n-doping of the 1Se state, with a steady-state intraband absorption in the 3-5 micron range, and intraband luminescence at 5 micron. low-toxicity, high thermal stability, and stable n-doping, InAs quantum dots become an interesting material for mid-infrared applications."

Our self-consistent mean-field analysis reveals that interlayer pairing results in partially gapless Fermi surfaces, with unpaired quasiparticles concentrated in the outer layers and a pronounced low-energy LDOS. We demonstrate that impurity effects vary significantly depending on both the pairing symmetry and impurity location: interlayer-dominant pairing produces sharp resonance states when impurities are in the inner layer, whereas impurities in the outer layer lead to in-gap enhancements without sharp resonances; in contrast, intralayer-dominant pairing generally yields increased in-gap LDOS without sharp impurity resonances, regardless of impurity position.

However, there are still significant challenges to overcome in these materials for practical applications mainly related to capacity degradation and voltage fading. A key influence factor for these challenges are phase transitions that occur by gliding of layers during operation of these materials.

In this work, we trained a classical pairwise Coulomb-Buckingham potential versus extensive \\textit{ab initio} data using a genetic algorithm to study O2-P2 phase transitions in Na\\textsubscript{\\textit{x}}CoO\\textsubscript{2}. Our density functional theory~(DFT) and classical potential calculations show that phase transition barriers decrease upon desodiation and are further lowered if dynamic conditions are considered through molecular dynamics simulations. Our developed classical potential is able to capture phase transitions and its related increase in the Na-ion diffusivity under standard lab conditions at the $\\upmu$s timescale of molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, it is found that the phase transition occurs gradually \\textit{via} various OP\\textit{n} phases."

This study reveals that unlike conventional intra-band SC for which disorder has a dramatic impact, that associated with FBs is surprisingly robust to disorder-induced fluctuations and quasi-particle localization. In particular, for weak off-diagonal disorder, the critical temperature decreases linearly with disorder amplitude for conventional SC, whereas it is only quadratic in the case of SC in FBs. Our findings could have a major impact on the research and development of new compounds whose high purity will no longer be a critical barrier to their synthesis."

We introduce a geometric map based on the local informational line element, calibrated by the Euclidean benchmark scale $C_{\\mathrm{vac}}$: $ds^{2} = C_{\\mathrm{vac}}/I(x,x+\\epsilon)$. We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$). A key insight is that anisotropy is necessary to activate tensor geometry; isotropic MI forces conformal flatness $g_{ij} \\propto \\delta_{ij}$, suppressing shear degrees of freedom. We employ a parameterization-invariant unimodular split $g_{ij} = V^{2/D}\\gamma_{ij}$, which rigorously separates local density fluctuations (volume $V$) from directional anisotropy (shape/shear $\\gamma_{ij}$). We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $\\gamma_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy. We work strictly in the local, fixed-coarse-graining $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$ branch; the line element is used solely to extract the local kinematic structure (the local metric tensor), deferring global distance claims."

      "summary": "A computational framework is presented for the sampling of the energy surface of magnetic systems via the systematic identification of first-order saddle points that determine connectivity of metastable states and define the mechanisms of transitions between them. The framework combines four stages: first, the symmetry of a given minimum-energy configuration is identified and used to define subsystems whose eigenmodes provide relevant deformation directions; the subsystem eigenmodes are then used to guide the system toward the vicinity of different saddle points surrounding the energy minimum; next, the geodesic minimum mode following method is employed to efficiently converge onto the saddle points; and finally, the identified saddle points are embedded into the state network. Applied to metastable textures in two-dimensional chiral magnets described by a lattice Hamiltonian, the method reveals a hierarchy of transition mechanisms governing the nucleation, annihilation, and rearrangement of the fundamental components of localized magnetic textures. The identified saddle points enable the construction of the network of metastable states, where saddle points define the connectivity between them, providing a comprehensive map of accessible transitions and their associated energy barriers. Transitions corresponding to both homotopies that preserve the topological charge and transformations that change it are identified. By scaling the interaction parameters, the distinct behavior of these two classes is obtained as the continuum limit is approached. Finally, it is shown that textures with the same topological charge are not always connected by a homotopy corresponding to a minimum-energy path: in specific parameter regimes, the total topological charge necessarily increases and then decreases (or vice versa) during the transition, returning to its initial value at the final state."

      "summary": "Correlated flat bands and altermagnetism are two important directions in quantum materials, centred respectively on interaction-dominated phases and symmetry-enforced spin-textured states, yet both derive from lattice symmetry and orbital hybridization. This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts."

We provide an exact solution for these states starting from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations describing quasiparticles in such junctions. We demonstrate that the dispersion of these subgap states depends only on the asymptotic properties of the pair-potential and not on its local spatial variation. Our study reveals the crucial distinction between junctions of non-chiral $p$-wave superconductors and those of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors by analyzing the wavefunction of their subgap bound states. We find a stable topological response leading to the well-known $4\\pi$ periodic Josephson effect protected against weak disorder potential for the non-chiral $p$-wave junctions; no such protection is found for junctions of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors. We supplement our analytic results with numerical computation of the Josephson currents in such junctions using exact numerical Green functions and starting from a lattice model of an itinerant altermagnet which is expected to host triplet $p$-wave superconductivity with equal-spin-pairing. We also discuss the implications of our results for Josephson junctions away from the transparent limit."

Here we demonstrate 175-fold spin-wave amplitude amplification in ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at temporal interfaces associated with a field-driven transition between a uniform in-plane state and a stripe-domain state, exceeding existing parametric and spin-torque schemes (10-50-fold) without a continuous power supply. When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms. Our analytical framework provides explicit design rules, while micromagnetic simulations capture the full nonlinear dynamics, including stripe-domain formation. This work establishes temporal magnonics as a new paradigm for reconfigurable, lithography-free spin-wave control."

      "summary": "Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) are widely used in applications that demand mechanical resilience, thermal stability, and compact form factors. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$. We demonstrate a 775 kHz flexural mode device with a quality factor (Q) of 200 and an extracted $k^2$ of 6.4%, yielding a high transmit efficiency of 65 nm/V with a mechanically robust active layer. We leverage the high performance to demonstrate extreme-temperature resilience, showcasing stable device operation up to 600 degrees C and survival up to 900 degrees C, highlighting LN's potential as a resilient PMUT platform."

We make contact with more traditional approaches by showing how the ESZM for S=1/2 acts on energy eigenstates given by solutions of the Bethe equations."

At half-filling, the zero-temperature ground state is a commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) with alternating occupied and empty sites. This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems."

      "summary": "Entropy production is arguably the most universally applicable measure of non-equilibrium behavior, particularly for systems coupled to a heat bath. This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories."

The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities."

While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes. Our results show that GPUs and TPUs achieve comparable performance in realistic scenarios, despite the relative immaturity of the TPU ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of both architectures to accelerate quantum-inspired techniques for industrial-scale simulations, particularly for homogenization problems."

The exact nature of the interactions and the origin of antiferromagnetism are still under debate.

The temperature-dependent anomalous Hall effect data reveal two sharp step-like switchings at low temperature ($T\\lesssim150\\,$K). Our detailed analyses suggest the step-like sharp switchings in anomalous Hall resistance are due to the magnetization reversal behavior of different Fe-ions in individual layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The experimental results can be explained by considering an intra-layer antiferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+3}$ ions, whereas intra-layer ferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ in the system. Our experimental results and the analyses are supported by the first-principles calculations for energetics and intralayer as well as interlayer exchange coupling constants."

      "summary": "In this work, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. This reformulation and reinterpretation goes beyond recent developments that treat Renormalization Group flow equations as conservation laws in field space and also allows to systematically understand and handle the nonconservative contributions in flow equations numerically. We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more realistic systems: One is the bosonic $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number."

      "summary": "Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have precipitated profound advances in microwave detection, manifesting themselves both in spatial resolution and sensitivity. However, typical methods based on Rabi oscillations are subject to detunings due to thermal and magnetic fluctuations and/or gradients, which introduce systematic errors and render the measurements susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach for determining both the magnitude and direction of microwaves, by exploiting the spectral line broadening effect in the optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. This method eliminates the requirement of aligning the MW frequency to the spin transitions and is therefore immune to variations and inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and temperature, providing an optimal tool for fast imaging applications. With this method, we achieved wide-field imaging of near field microwaves generated with a microscale $\\rm{\\Omega}$-pattern antenna with a resolution of 800\\,nm. Combining with the vector detection using multi-axis NVs, a full reconstruction of the vector microwave fields is obtained. Besides, our scheme also exhibits excellent linearity over a broad range of MW amplitudes, and the scale is theoretically calculated to be more than four orders. Our results augment the applicability of diamond-based microwave devices in applications under complex scenarios, especially where large dynamic range, fast test speed, and high spatial resolution are demanded."

Their performance varies with material choice and processing conditions. Electrochromic thin film electrodes require a smooth, defect-free coating for optimal contrast between bleached and colored states. The complexity of optimizing the spin-coated electrochromic thin layer poses challenges for rapid development. This study demonstrates the use of self-driving laboratories to accelerate the development of electrochromic coatings by coupling automation with machine learning. Our system combines automated data acquisition, image processing, spectral analysis, and Bayesian optimization to explore processing parameters efficiently. This approach not only increases throughput but also enables a pointed search for optimal processing parameters. The approach can be applied to various solution-processed materials, highlighting the potential of self-driving labs in enhancing materials discovery and process optimization."

      "summary": "The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations."

Achieving these capabilities in practical systems increasingly demands chip-scale integration of THz photonic components that are typically bulky. In this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a unique platform for integrated nonlinear photonics in the visible and near-infrared regimes, and extending this framework into the THz domain would constitute a significant advance. Here, we report tunable, intense, and narrowband THz radiation from ferroelectric niobium oxyhalides. Through halogen substitution and alloying, we achieve continuous and precise control over the emission frequency from 3.1 to 5.8 THz. We show that the narrowband THz radiation is driven by phonons associated with the ferroelectric polarization. We further demonstrate dynamic and nonvolatile control of the polarity of the coherent THz wave with external electric field. This work demonstrates efficient narrowband THz emission from vdW ferroeletrics and provides microscopic insight into its origin, paving the way for on-chip THz technology for a broad range of applications."

      "summary": "Nuclear fusion requires overcoming or traversing a repulsive Coulomb barrier of hundreds of kiloelectronvolts, rendering the probability of fusion at sub-keV energies vanishingly small. Yet in condensed matter, the electronic and structural environment of reacting nuclei can profoundly alter fusion rates. Here we demonstrate that deuterium-deuterium fusion within metallic foils exhibits a pronounced enhancement and reaction yield plateau below energies of 2.5 keV- contrary to the expected exponential suppression with decreasing energy. Using a dual-chamber platform that combines electrochemical deuterium loading with ion-beam bombardment, we show that fusion yields in palladium and titanium hydrides are enhanced by over 10^18 compared to theoretical bare-nucleus fusion rates. These results demonstrate that access to low-energy fusion processes can be governed by materials degrees of freedom. This materials-driven fusion regime establishes a reproducible, tunable framework for studying and ultimately engineering nuclear reactions in solids. While the reaction rates reported here are low, these insights into materials-modulated fusion processes offer a potential foundation for understanding how condensed-matter environments could influence future fusion-energy concepts."

Using a symmetry-driven cotangent-bundle approach, we show that the isometry group of each slicing acts on phase space in such a way that only its Casimir invariants and the time-like coordinate unconstrained, so the distribution function depends solely on these quantities. This yields a unified boost-invariant exact solution of the Boltzmann equation valid for each constant-curvature foliation of \\ds. Specializing this general solution to the flat and spherical foliations reproduces the Bjorken and Gubser flows, respectively, while its restriction to the hyperbolic foliation produces a genuinely new analytic solution (`Grozdanov flow'). Hydrodynamics and free streaming emerge naturally as limiting regimes of this novel exact solution. We further comment on several relevant aspects of the new boost-invariant solution on the hyperbolic slicing and on their interpretation once mapped back to Minkowski space."

      "summary": "Modern neural networks exhibit a striking property: basins of attraction in the loss landscape are often connected by low-loss paths, yet optimization dynamics generally remain confined to a single convex basin and rarely explore intermediate points. We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics. Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space. Our results highlight the role of curvature-induced entropic forces in governing both connectivity and confinement in deep learning landscapes."

      "summary": "Negatively charged silicon vacancy centers in diamond (SiV$^-$) are promising for quantum photonic technologies. However, when subject to resonant optical excitation, they can inadvertently transfer into a zero-spin optically dark state. We show that this unwanted change of charge state can be quickly reversed by the resonant laser itself in combination with static electric fields. By defining interdigitated metallic contacts on the diamond surface, we increase the steady-state SiV$^-$ photoluminescence under resonant excitation by a factor $\\ge3$ for most emitters, making it practically constant for certain individual emitters. We electrically activate single \\sivs near the positively biased electrode, which are entirely dark without applying local electric fields. Using time-resolved 3-color experiments, we show that the resonant laser not only excites the SiV$^-$, but also creates free holes that convert SiV$^{2-}$ to SiV$^-$ on a timescale of milliseconds. Through analysis of several individual emitters, our results show that the degree of electrical charge state controllability differs between individual emitters, indicating that their local environment plays a key role. Our proposed electric-field-based stabilization scheme enhances deterministic charge state control in group-IV color centers and improves its understanding, offering a scalable path toward quantum applications such as entanglement generation and quantum key distribution."

Graph neural networks (GNNs) in which messages are passed between nodes that represent atoms that are spatial neighbors promise to obviate manual feature engineering, but the use of GNNs with biomolecular systems of more than a few hundred residues has been limited in the context of analyzing dynamics by both difficulties in capturing the details of long-range interactions with message passing and the memory and runtime requirements associated with large graphs. Here, we show how local information can be aggregated to reduce memory and runtime requirements without sacrificing atomic detail. We demonstrate that this approach opens the door to analyzing simulations of protein-nucleic acid complexes with thousands of residues on single GPUs within minutes. For systems with hundreds of residues, for which there are sufficient data to make quantitative comparisons, we show that the approach improves performance and interpretability."

In this work, we investigate how the tilt angle influences sedimentation in narrow channels across different particle volume fractions.

Furthermore, at large tilt angles, the flow profiles across the channel deviate from the classical parabolic shape. We show that these non-parabolic profiles can be accurately captured by a one-dimensional Brinkman model, providing a predictive framework for understanding and tuning sedimentation in tilted geometries. Our findings demonstrate the potential to control and optimize particle settling by adjusting the channel tilt according to particle concentration, opening new possibilities for design in industrial and laboratory processes."

Recent developments in spectrum-based entanglement witnesses have enabled new strategies for quantifying many-body entanglement in macroscopic materials. Here, we develop a protocol for detecting spin--orbital entanglement using experiment-accessible resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Central to our approach is the construction of a Hermitian generator from experimentally measurable spectra, which allows us to compute the quantum Fisher information (QFI) available in spin--orbital systems. The resulting QFI provides upper bounds for $k$-producible states and thus serves as a robust witness of spin--orbital entanglement. To account for realistic experimental limitations, we further extend our framework to include relaxed QFI bounds applicable to measurements lacking full polarization resolution."

Remarkably, despite the fact that the MLP is trained without any input from these considered models, it correctly identifies the critical temperatures of the studied physical systems. Particularly, the MLP outcomes suggest convincingly that the $q=3$ model is critical only at zero temperature and $q=4,5,6$ models remain disordered at all temperatures. Previously, this MLP has been successfully applied to uncover the nature of the phase transitions of 2D antiferromagnetic Ising model with multi-interactions. Therefore, it will be interesting to examine whether the already trained MLP can detect other models with untypical critical phenomena."

By systematically varying the disorder configuration -- including the values and probabilities of the multivariate distribution -- we demonstrate that both the number and width of TAI phases can be precisely engineered. Analytical determination of topological phase boundaries via the inverse localization length shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our results reveal a rich landscape of disorder-induced topological phase transitions, including multiple reentrant TAI phases that arise as the disorder amplitude increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean chiral displacement serves as a sensitive probe for detecting these topological transitions, providing a practical route for experimental realization in photonic waveguide lattices. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing quantum and photonic materials with customizable topological properties driven by tailored disorder."

      "summary": "As quantum computing processors increase in size, there is growing interest in developing cryogenic electronics to overcome significant challenges to system scaling. Single flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits offer a promising alternative to remote, bulky, and power-hungry room temperature electronics. To meet the need for digital qubit control, readout, and co-processing, SFQ circuits must be adapted to operate at millikelvin temperatures near quantum processors. SEEQC's SFQuClass digital quantum management approach proximally places energy-efficient SFQ (ERSFQ) circuits and qubits in a multi-chip module. This enables extremely low power dissipation, compatible with a typical dilution cryostat's limited cooling power, while maintaining high processing speed and low error rates. We report on systematic testing from 4 K to 10 mK of a comprehensive set of ERSFQ cells, as well as more complex circuits such as programmable counters and demultiplexers used in digital qubit control. We compare the operating margins and error rates of these circuits and find that, at millikelvin, bias margins decrease and the center of the margins (i.e., the optimal bias current value) increases by ~15%, compared to 4.2 K. The margins can be restored by thermal annealing by reducing Josephson junction (JJ) critical current Ic. To provide guidance for how circuit parameters vary from 4.2 K to millikelvin, relevant analog process control monitors (PCMs) were tested in the temperature range of interest. The measured JJ critical current (of the PCM JJ arrays) increases by ~15% when decreasing temperature from 4.2 K to millikelvin, in good agreement with both theory and the empirically measured change in the center of bias margins for the tested digital circuits."

      "summary": "Accurately predicting experimentally-realizable 3D molecular crystal structures from their 2D chemical graphs is a long-standing open challenge in computational chemistry called crystal structure prediction (CSP). Efficiently solving this problem has implications ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors, as crystal packing directly governs the physical and chemical properties of organic solids. In this paper, we introduce OXtal, a large-scale 100M parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale OXtal, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization -- thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. By leveraging a large dataset of 600K experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), OXtal achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior ab initio machine learning CSP methods, while remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches. Specifically, OXtal recovers experimental structures with conformer $\\text{RMSD}_1<0.5$ {\\AA} and attains over 80\\% packing similarity rate, demonstrating its ability to model both thermodynamic and kinetic regularities of molecular crystallization."

      "summary": "We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware."

However, as the AdS black brane approaches its final global equilibrium, this linear quasinormal mode description becomes inadequate, and nonlinear dynamics play a significant role in the late-stage evolution. We show that the interplay between nonlinear evolution and horizon dissipation in general relativity drives dynamical AdS black branes towards the final state along a unique path, independent of their initial perturbations. Through numerical simulations, we identify this late-time attractor and uncover the associated universal nonlinear behavior, characterized by a simple dimensionless relative amplitude in the dual hydrodynamic variables."

Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and may often be trajectory dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension surface defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using radial basis functions. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We validate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements."

While so-called non-Markovian dynamics is common in larger systems with interacting components, observations in fundamental physical systems have been confined to specifically engineered cases. Here, we report the experimental observation of non-Markovian dynamics in an elemental material, crystalline cobalt. By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems."

We further construct a single convolutional classifier of phase states of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square, triangular, honeycomb, and kagome lattices, trained on configurations generated by the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. Computed temperature profiles of the averaged posterior probability of the high-temperature phase form clear S-shaped curves that intersect in the vicinity of the theoretical critical temperatures and allow one to determine the critical temperature for the kagome lattice without additional retraining.

The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--H\\\"{a}nchen shifts at the edge."

This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC. This optimization is crucial for advancing large-scale, high-performance h-BN based DUV photodetector fabrication."

At first, the dynamical evolution of a signal transmitted from an auxiliary cavity is employed to pinpoint a macroscopic switching event in a bistable main cavity subject to direct photodetection. Once the decision is made on the occurrence of a downward switch, the main cavity mode is let to freely decay to the vacuum, monitored to the production of an integrated charge. In the long-time limit, the charge distribution over an identical collection of pure states generated during the jumps converges to the Q function (heterodyne detection) or marginals of the Wigner function (homodyne detection) dictated by the phase of the local oscillator. When fluctuations over the ensemble step in, we connect the statistical properties of several switching events and the ensuing production of current records, to the cavity field correlations associated with the breakdown of photon blockade."

      "summary": "We study two entanglement measures in a large family of isotropic many-body states including incompressible quantum Hall liquids and quantum critical systems: the logarithmic negativity (LN), and mutual information (MI). For pure states, obtained for example from a bipartition at zero temperature, these provide distinct characterizations of the entanglement present between two spatial subregions, while for mixed states (such as at finite temperature) only the LN remains a good entanglement measure. Our focus is on regions that have corners, either adjacent or tip-touching. We first obtain general non-perturbative properties regarding the geometrical dependence of the LN and MI. A close similarity is observed with mutual charge fluctuations, where super-universal angle dependence holds allowing for explicit checks. For the MI, we make stronger statements due to strong subadditivity. We also give ramifications of our general analysis to conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions. We then explicitly verify these properties with integer quantum Hall states. To do so we develop two independent approaches to obtain the fermionic LN, which takes into account Fermi statistics: an overlap-matrix method, and a real-space lattice discretization. At finite temperature, we find a rapid decrease of the LN well inside the cyclotron gap at integer fillings. We further show that the LN decays faster compared to the MI at high temperatures."

In this article, we present a \\textit{post-experiment} coincidence counting method and propose two \\textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques, \\textit{post-experiment} coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and \\textit{post-experiment} coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS). By coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes, the \\textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. The \\textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can be implemented upon the \\textit{pulse}-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatus with \\textit{pulse} photon or neutron source. When implemented experimentally, they will be powerful techniques to study the highly esoteric high-temperature superconductivity and the highly coveted quantum spin liquids."

      "summary": "The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Green's functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\\Delta \\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\\Delta \\omega = 2\\pi/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this limitation can be overcome by augmenting the time series with complex-time Krylov states. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method."

      "summary": "Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays a crucial role in stabilizing the exotic topologically stable skyrmion spin textures in the noncentrosymmetric crystals. The recent discovery of biskyrmions and skyrmions in the globally centrosymmetric crystals has raised debate about the role of the DMI in causing the spin textures, since DMI vanishes in such crystal structures. Theoretical studies, on the other hand, suggest non-vanishing DMI even if there is local inversion symmetry breaking in an otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystal structure. Motivated by such theoretical predictions, we present here the results of a systematic crystal structure study of two skyrmion-hosting Ni2In-type centrosymmetric hexagonal compounds, MnNiGa and MnPtGa, using the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) technique. Our result provides information about structural correlations in the short-range (SR), medium-range (MR) and long-range (LR) regimes simultaneously. The analysis of the experimental PDFs, obtained from high flux, high energy, and high Q synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction patterns, reveals that the local SR structure of both MnNiGa and MnPtGa compounds corresponds to the noncentrosymmetric trigonal space group P3m1, while the structure in the MR+LR regimes remains hexagonal in the centrosymmetric P63/mmc space group. These findings are also supported by theoretical DFT calculations. Our results, in conjunction with the previous theoretical predictions, provide a rationale for the genesis of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials in terms of non-vanishing DMI due to local inversion symmetry breaking. We believe that our findings would encourage a systematic search of skyrmionic textures and other topological phenomena in a vast family of centrosymmetric materials."

      "summary": "Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a versatile tool for enhancing light-matter interactions by strongly confining light fields. Chiral BICs are photonic resonances with a high degree of circular polarisation, which hold great promise for spin-selective applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of a chiral BIC for inducing strong coupling between the circularly polarised photons and spin-polarised (valley) excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs). By placing monolayer WS$_2$ onto the BIC-hosting metasurface, we observe the formation of intrinsically chiral, valley-selective exciton polaritons, evidenced by circularly polarised photoluminescence (PL) at two distinct energy levels. The PL intensity and degree of circular polarisation of polaritons exceed those of uncoupled excitons in our structure by an order of magnitude. Our microscopic model shows that this enhancement is due to folding of the Brillouin zone creating a direct emission path for high-momenta polaritonic states far outside the light cone, thereby providing a shortcut to thermalisation (energy relaxation) and suppressing depolarisation. Moreover, while the polarisation of the upper polariton is determined by the valley excitons, the lower polariton behaves like an intrinsic chiral emitter with its polarisation fixed by the BIC. Therefore, the spin alignment of the upper and lower polaritons ($\\uparrow\\downarrow$ and $\\uparrow \\uparrow$) can be controlled by $\\sigma^+$ and $\\sigma^-$ polarised optical excitation, respectively. Our work introduces a new type of chiral light-matter quasi-particles in atomically-thin semiconductors and provides an insight into their energy relaxation dynamics."

We demonstrate that this bond-modulated ladder naturally hosts two propagation channels, whose symmetric and antisymmetric combinations experience opposite effective onsite potentials, unlike the one-dimensional quasiperiodic models with onsite modulations. Using the adiabatic (slowly varying) limit of the modulation, we derive an exact analytical condition for the single-particle mobility edge, $E_c=\\pm|2t-\\lambda|,$ where $t$ is the hopping amplitude along both the legs and $\\lambda$ is the bond modulation strength. This result directly generalizes the classic ME condition for slowly varying onsite potentials to a multi-leg (two-leg in our case) geometry. Extensive numerical calculations, including inverse participation ratios, Lyapunov exponents, density of states, and participation-ratio scaling, demonstrate excellent agreement with the analytical prediction across a wide range of parameters. We further identify a regime for small modulation exponents $0 < \\nu <1$, where localized and weakly delocalized states coexist even beyond the transition point ($\\lambda_c=2t$). Our results establish that a deterministic bond modulation can serve as a sufficient ingredient to produce an exact ME in ladder systems, offering experimentally accessible routes toward tuning nonergodic extended phases."

At low temperatures, the system develops two exciton condensates. The condensates are related to each other by TR symmetry and weakly coupled by a Josephson tunneling term. The latter leads to the formation of the Leggett mode [Number-phase fluctuations in two-band superconductors, Prog. Theor. Phys. 36, 901 (1966).] with a small gap. Our main finding is that the Leggett mode couples to the EM fields as a massive dynamical axion. This is a consequence of the chiral anomaly and the chiral magnetic effect in the parent WSM. Because of the small axion mass, its coupling to EM fields results in a giant anisotropic polarizability and birefringence in the presence of a static magnetic field. The photon-axion hybridization produces a polariton resonance near the axion gap."

      "summary": "Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (sDCs). In this study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of non-zero sDCs. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, particles will eventually reach the boundary with probability one, and that diffusion with a sDC exhibits higher transport efficiency in an early arrival of particles at the boundary than would be expected under diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average (EA) of the sDC. When particles begin to reach an absorbing boundary before the change in a sDC occurs, diffusion with a sDC with a larger supremum exhibits a more efficient transport in an early arrival of particles at the boundary even if the EAs of sDCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, the mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach an absorbing boundary, higher transport efficiency in an early arrival at the boundary almost disappears and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the EA and the convergence speed is determined by the time scale of fluctuations in the DC. We finally discuss the similarities and differences of FPT properties between three-dimensional diffusion outside a spherical absorbing boundary and the one-dimensional diffusion. Our results indicate that fluctuations in DCs may need to be non-Markov and/or non-ergodic to allow efficient transport of particles to distant targets. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role, for example, in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology."

Whereas the spatial structure of these helical edge states has been largely studied, their dynamic properties are much less understood. We design a microwave experiment mimicking QSHE and explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of unidirectional transport of optical angular momentum (or pseudospin) by edge states. Pseudospin-polarized signal propagation is shown to be immune to scattering by defects introduced along the edge. Its velocity is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude slower than the speed of light in the free space, which may have important consequences for practical applications of topological edge states in modern optical and quantum-information technologies."

      "summary": "This paper explores the effect of strong-to-weak fragmentation transition, namely freezing transition, and its rich characteristics in a family of one-dimensional spinless fermionic models involving short-to-long-range facilitated hoppings with an East constraint. Focusing on this family of models with range-$q$ terms, our investigation furnishes an exhaustive understanding of the fractured Hilbert space utilizing the enumerative combinatorics and transfer matrix methods. This further allows us to get insight into the freezing transition in this family of models with the help of the generalization of Catalan numbers introduced by Frey and Sellers for $q>1$, further revealing that increasing the range of constraints drives the transition to transpire at lower filling fractions as $n_c = 1/(q+1)$. This distinct fragmentation structure also yields the emergence of ground states at multiple fillings; further, the ground state exhibits signatures of criticality with logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. Thereafter, our investigation exemplifies that the above transition has a profound impact on the thermalization of bulk and boundary autocorrelators at long times, which includes an intricate filling-dependent inhomogeneous long-time autocorrelation profiles across the chain in OBCs. Finally, we probe the effect of the same on the transport at intermediate times in PBCs, restricting ourselves to models up to range-3 constraints. This investigation discloses a vast range of anomalous transport possibilities, ranging from size-stretched exponential relaxation through superdiffusive to subdiffusive behaviors akin to the fragmentation structure supported by the filling fraction and range of constraints. In brevity, our paper reveals intriguing possibilities conspired by an intriguing interplay between constraints with varying ranges, fragmentation structure, and freezing transition."

      "summary": "A systematic structural study of the Fe2Mo3O8 system as a function of pressure, temperature, and magnetic field reveals that the P63mc space group of this material remains stable for a broad range of these parameters. No changes are seen in the long-range structure for pressures between 0 and 10 GPa, temperatures between 11 K and 300 K, and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The magnetostructural response (delta c/c) for a magnetic field transverse to the c-axis displacement is determined. The system is found to exhibit strong magnetostructural coupling. The well-known magnetic-field-induced first-order transition is found to be isostructural, between two distinct altermagnet states, and is accessible by fields in the a-b plane. In terms of the c/a ratio, the structures between ambient pressure and 10 GPa are found to map onto the full Zn doping range ((Fe1-yZny)2Mo3O8,0<1) in this system. The results show that the critical sensitive structural parameter for tuning the magnetic properties with pressure, temperature, and pressure is the c-axis length. The results indicate that the magnetic order in this complex metal oxide system (A2Mo3O8, A=Co, Mn, and Ni) can be cleanly tuned by pressure, making this class of materials an excellent platform for magnetic order switching in films grown on piezoelectric substrates."

      "summary": "The rapid growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) has brought increasing attention to their energy use during training and inference. Here, we establish the thermodynamic bounds on energy consumption in quasi-static analog DNNs by mapping modern feedforward architectures onto a physical free-energy functional. This framework provides a direct statistical-mechanical interpretation of quasi-static DNNs. As a result, inference can proceed in a thermodynamically reversible manner, with vanishing minimal energy cost, in contrast to the Landauer limit that constrains digital hardware. Importantly, inference corresponds to relaxation to a unique free-energy minimum with F_{\\min}=0, allowing all constraints to be satisfied without residual stress. By comparison, training overconstrains the system: simultaneous clamping of inputs and outputs generates stresses that propagate backward through the architecture, reproducing the rules of backpropagation. Parameter annealing then relaxes these stresses, providing a purely physical route to learning without an explicit loss function. We further derive a universal lower bound on training energy, E< 2NDkT, which scales with both the number of trainable parameters and the dataset size."

We further extend our analysis to bands perturbed away from the ideal limit and give examples where a less ideal band geometry results in a more stable FCI phase. To explain our findings, we apply the single mode approximation to the ground state wave functions of the ideal band, from which we obtain analytic expressions for the magnetoroton minimum.

Coherence time, a key figure of merit for any quantum system, is fundamentally limited by the lifetime of quasiparticles that store quantum information. For magnons - bosonic excitations of collective magnetization dynamics - it has long been reported that their lifetime does not exceed a few hundred nanoseconds, placing a stringent constraint on their use in quantum architectures. Here, we demonstrate magnon lifetimes exceeding 18 {\\mu}s. Experiments performed on single-crystal yttrium iron garnet spheres cooled to 30 mK reveal relaxation times of short-wavelength magnons nearly two orders of magnitude longer than previously observed. These findings overturn the established view of magnon dissipation limits, positioning magnons as viable, long-lived information carriers for solid-state quantum computing."

An analysis of intrinsic defects based on density functional theory (DFT) identifies chromium interstitials ($Cr_i$) stabilized between CrSBr layers as the most favorable shallow donors. Bromine-on-sulfur antisites ($Br_S$) and bromine vacancies ($V_{Br}$) are also found to act as potential donors, albeit with deeper ionization energies.

For example, simply illuminating 2D materials in the integer quantum Hall regime with polarized light is predicted to drive quantum phase transitions. Such phenomena are largely beyond the current frontier of solid state experiments due to technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report results of such an experiment. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in anomalous polarization-dependent subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities."

      "summary": "A two dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with topological defects like domain walls (DW) / vortices or quasi-periodic disorders is a perfect blend for investigating topology and localization of quantum states. In a 2D SSH model, zero energy states (ZES) lie within the dispersion continuum for both periodic and open boundaries. We consider two different distribution of DWs of which the first one shows the bound states in continuum (BIC) to populate at the corners (producing higher order topological modes) or the DW center while the second one, with a vortex like radially symmetric distribution of hopping modulations, shows localizations along the DWs and the edges. The topological yet gapped in-gap states, with nonzero Zak phases, show an opposite trend with localizations at the edges and along the DWs in the first case as opposed to localizations at the DW center in the second case. Investigation on the effect of on-site quasiperiodic disorders manifests the usual tendency of the states to localize. However, reentrant localization behavior is also captured for judicious choice of the disordered term, making this the first reported example of its kind in a 2D system. Furthermore, while varying the hopping periodicity, we discover that anisotropic hopping modulations along x and y directions within the lattice produces significant changes in topological features where bulk ZES get exhausted leaving only topological boundary modes at zero energies. We also discuss the fate of these states in presence of the DWs. All these analysis depicting topological/localization features of varied kinds can become very useful in the field of quantum computation and information processing."

Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems."

Here, we study the effect of charge regulation (CR) on the interaction between two nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) in an electrolyte solution. To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo / molecular dynamics simulation framework to systematically explore the effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface charge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct molecular simulations under constant charge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto NP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a wide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR leads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC model yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore, we find that the CR effects are more pronounced at low salt concentration, whereas at high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR and CC cases, diminishing the CR effect. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing nanoparticle interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in low salt concentrations."

Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA.

Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single band gap. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from the well-known first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Particularly, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and discover a three-dimensional unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both helical and corner topological states and exhibits an unprecedented bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization.

This novel approach is then compared to the well-established iterative method to solve Sudoku already used in binary Hopfield networks (HNN). Solving optimization problems typically requires a large amount of energy to solve on conventional hardware. Therefore, we are motivated to explore the mapping of Sudoku from a theoretical point of view to establish the validity of this approach. The simulation results show that the novel ONN mapping outperforms the established HNN methodology."

These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remains challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin-liquid and spin-glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among p spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size N dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of p. We show that the phase diagrams for different p can be unified through a scaling with N/p2, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin-liquid phase and extends the spin-glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin-liquid phase transitions into the spin-glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them."

      "summary": "Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture."

      "summary": "Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key elements in practical spintronics, enabling not only conventional tasks such as data storage, transmission, and processing but also the implementation of compute-in-memory processing elements, facilitating the development of efficient hardware for neuromorphic computing. The functionality of an MTJ is determined by the properties of its free layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) with fixed magnetization, separated by an MgO tunnel barrier. This paper presents a mechanism for reconfiguring the RL, which is the upper layer of a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, enabling a reversible transition from a single-domain state to a vortex magnetic state with different core positions. When the RL is in the vortex state, it generates a spin current with a vortex-like polarization distribution, enabling stable vortex oscillations in the FL even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect has been confirmed in MTJs with diameters ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. It is demonstrated, using experimental data with comparative micromagnetic simulation, that the pinning antiferromagnet retains a long term memory of previous reannealing states resulting in a deformation of the vortex polarised spin current, which in turn introduces a strong dynamical vortex core polarity symmetry breaking. The analogue reprogrammable nature of both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ demonstrate different possible routes for the introduction of non-volatility into radiofrequency spintronic neuromorphic paradigms."

Traditional approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enables high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges."

      "summary": "Collisions of atoms and molecules with metal surfaces create electronic excitations in the metal, leading to nonadiabatic energy dissipation, inelastic scattering, and sticking. Mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics with electronic friction, are able to capture nonadiabatic energy loss during dynamics at metal surfaces. Hydrogen atom scattering from semiconductors, on the other hand, exhibits strong adsorbate-surface energy transfer only when the projectile kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the substrate. Electronic friction fails to describe this effect. Here, we report a first-principles parameterization of a simple Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian model of hydrogen atom gas-surface scattering on Ge(111)$c(2\\times8)$, for which hyperthermal scattering experiments have been reported. We subsequently perform independent-electron surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations on this model, and validate these results through numerically exact quantum-dynamical simulations using the hierarchical equation of motion approach. While mean-field dynamics yield weak nonadiabatic energy loss that is independent of the initial kinetic energy, independent electron surface hopping simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental observation that nonadiabatic energy dissipation only occurs if the initial kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the surface."

It can be estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step, resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag time. The key idea is that, when trajectories enter the stable states, the times that they enter (stopping times) must be used for estimating the committor and transition rate instead of the lag time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of lag time. We show how further accuracy for the transition rate can be achieved by combining results from two lag times. We also relate the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics based on the mean-squared residual and discuss further numerical considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes."

The microstructure is characterized by two-point statistics (covariance and spectral density) that govern finite-size fluctuations. Capillarity is modeled as a screened, modified-Helmholtz problem with phase-dependent transport under periodic boundary conditions; periodic homogenization yields an apparent conductivity, an apparent screening parameter, and a macroscopic capillary decay length. Because screening imparts a spatial low-pass response, we introduce a distribution-aware treatment of polydispersity consisting of a capillarity-weighted volume fraction and a screened analogue of the integral range that preserves variance units and recovers classical descriptors in the appropriate limits. These descriptors lead to two sizing rules: (i) a length criterion on the shortest cell edge controlled by a microstructural correlation length, the macroscopic decay length, and a high quantile of grain size; and (ii) a volume criterion that links the target coefficient of variation to the screened integral range and the phase contrast. The framework couples statistical microstructure information to capillary response and yields reproducible, distribution-aware supercell selection for image-based finite-element or fast-Fourier-transform solvers."

We introduce a hypergraph-based formalism, Blocks & Bonds (B&amp;B), that generalizes classical chemical graph theory by incorporating directed and multicolored interactions, internal symmetries, and hierarchical organization. Within this framework, we develop the Structure Code (SC), a compact and versatile language for describing self-assembled architectures. We define a Kolmogorov-style Structural Complexity as the total information content of SC, obtained through its tokenization and Shannon information assignment. Complementing this encoding-based measure, we introduce a much simpler quantity, the Compositional Complexity, which depends only on the number and cumulative usage of block and bond types in the construction set. A central result of this work is a strong empirical correlation between the token-based Structural Complexity and the Compositional Complexity across all examined systems. Owing to this agreement, the Compositional Complexity emerges as the most practical and broadly applicable measure: it is easy to compute, requires no explicit encoding, and yet closely tracks the actual information content of structurally diverse architectures. Applications to molecular systems (ethylene glycol, glucose), DNA-origami lattices, and crystalline assemblies show that B\\&amp;B hypergraphs provide a unified, scalable, and information-efficient representation of structural organization, naturally capturing symmetry, modularity, and stereochemistry. This framework establishes a quantitative foundation for complexity-aware classification and inverse design of programmable matter."

      "summary": "This work investigates the magneto-transport properties of exfoliated NiTe2 nano-flakes with varying thicknesses and disorder levels, unveiling two distinct physical mechanisms governing the observed anisotropic linear magnetoresistance (MR). For the perpendicular magnetic field configuration, the well-defined linear MR in high fields is unambiguously attributed to a classical origin. This conclusion is supported by the proportionality between the MR slope and the carrier mobility, and between the crossover field and the inverse of mobility. In stark contrast, the linear MR under parallel magnetic fields exhibits a non-classical character. It shows a pronounced enhancement with decreasing flake thickness, which correlates with an increasing hole-to-electron concentration ratio. This distinctive thickness dependence suggests an origin in the nonlinear band effects near the Dirac point, likely driven by the shift of the Fermi level. Furthermore, the strengthening of MR anisotropic with enhanced inter-layer transport contradicts the prediction of the guiding-center diffusion model for three-dimensional systems. Our findings highlight the critical roles of band topology and structural dimensional in the anomalous magneto-transport of Dirac semi-metals."

Despite its importance for the fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a qubit and a thermal bath. The system is formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically coupled to a $\\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of coherence in quantum thermodynamics. Our work opens the possibility to demonstrate a true quantum thermal machine where heat is measured directly."

The irradiation of intense circularly polarized femtosecond pules to magnetic materials can alter the magnetic orders and elementary excitations, particularly in the visible to infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, the recent development of x-ray free-electron laser enables the element-specific trace of the ultrafast dynamics with high time and spatial resolution. However, the light helicity of x-ray photons has not yet been used to control order parameters in condensed matter materials, not limited to such magnetic phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic magnetization reversal of a ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt multilayer solely by irradiating femtosecond pulses of circularly polarized hard x-rays. The observed all-optical magnetization switching depends on the helicity of incident x-ray pulses and is strongly resonant with the photon energy at the Pt $L_3$ edge. These results originate in the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism of Pt, involving helicity-dependent excitation from the 2$p_{3/2}$ core level to the exchange-split 5$d$ valence states owing to the magnetic proximity effect with Co. These findings mark a new frontier for examining interactions between light and matter in the x-ray region."

      "summary": "The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the accumulation of a macroscopic number of bulk states at system boundaries, is a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics. However, effective control of skin-mode localization in higher-dimensional systems remains a significant challenging. Here, we propose a versatile approach to manipulate the localization of skin modes in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices by combining disorder with a static electric field. While the electric field alone suppresses the NHSE in a clean system, the introduction of disorder induces transverse wave-packet transport perpendicular to the field. In nonreciprocal lattices, when the nonreciprocal hopping is misaligned with the electric field, the hopping component perpendicular to the field guides wave-packet propagation and produces boundary localization. By tuning the relative orientation between the electric field and the nonreciprocal hopping direction, the boundary localization position can be continuously and arbitrarily controlled. We further demonstrate distinct geometry-dependent manipulation of skin modes in reciprocal lattices, where controllable boundary localization emerges solely from the lattice geometry. These results establish a robust and tunable mechanism for engineering boundary accumulation and directed transport in non-Hermitian systems, offering new opportunities for applications in classical platforms and quantum materials."

      "summary": "Tailoring at will polar textures in ferroelectrics is critical for the development of nanoscale electronics and functional oxide technologies. Freestanding ferroelectric membranes have enabled studies of strain-induced polarization responses, but the control over membrane shape and local polarization typically remains limited to spontaneous buckling or uniaxial mechanical deformations. In this work, we employ a versatile photosensitive-polymer patterning approach to impose programmable bending strain profiles in ferroelectric membranes. Using BaTiO3 as a model system, we demonstrate deterministic 90{\\deg} polarization rotation driven by engineered in-plane strain, and 180{\\deg} polarization reversal arising from flexoelectric coupling through a controlled strain gradient. These results establish this programmable bending as a powerful approach to investigate strain-dependent domain structures, leverage flexoelectric effects, and engineer custom ferroelectric landscapes across a wide range of oxide membranes."

Recently, their capabilities have expanded with the development of light-emitting memristors, which operate through various emission mechanisms. One notable process involves the electroluminescence of defects generated within the switching matrix during device activation. In this study, we explore the early-stage formation and evolution of the species responsible for light emission in Ag-based in-plane memristors. Our approach combines electrical stimulation with correlated optical electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements. The findings provide valuable insights into controlling emission processes in memristors, paving the way for their integration as essential components in neuromorphic circuits."

      "summary": "Field theories predict that phase transitions sequentially breaking continuous and discrete symmetries can generate hybrid topological structures in which defects of different dimensionalities merge. We report experimental and numerical studies of hybrid defects in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, which undergo a cascaded transition from isotropic liquid to a high-symmetry apolar, and then to a low-symmetry polar nematic phase. By imposing surface anchoring to preset disclination configurations, we directly track the transformation of topological defects across the transition. We show that simple disclinations reproducibly evolve into complex hybrid states, including domain walls terminated by surface disclinations, domain walls decorated with monopoles, and merons-mediated boojums and monopoles. These results provide definitive experimental validation of hybrid defects in a soft matter system and establish ferroelectric nematics as a model platform for exploring and engineering polar defect structures."

Among various approaches, the Size Strain Plot (SSP) method is widely employed for its conceptual simplicity and ease of use.

This pervasive error raises concerns about the validity of a significant body of published microstructural data. By tracing the historical origin of the misformulated equation, we demonstrate how a seemingly minor oversight evolved into a widely accepted standard practice within the field. We then present a dimensionally consistent formulation that restores physical meaning and analytical reliability to the SSP method. The corrected framework re-establishes the SSP approach as a robust and physically valid tool for XRD-based microstructural characterization. \\en"

Here, cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) is introduced as a new analytical approach for LC materials, using 4'-Pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) and 4'-Octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) as representative model compounds. This was enabled by a tailored cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) protocol optimized for small organic molecules. The method enables controlled field evaporation of both intact molecules and diagnostic fragments, achieving over 90% molecular retention while preserving four characteristic dissociation patterns. By spatially correlating these fragmentation profiles with the local electric field derived from the tip geometry, we reveal field-directed dissociation pathways of CB molecules. In parallel, the distribution of intact molecular ions enables nanoscale visualization of material structure: we resolve homogeneous mixing of 5CB and 8CB in the nematic phase and directly observe the sub-nanometer crystalline layering in a supercooled 8CB sample, with contrast to the surrounding amorphous matrix suggesting the presence of a solid-liquid interface. This work establishes cryo-APT as a new powerful analytical platform for LC research and reveals its broad potential for application in soft matter systems."

Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials."

We show that these strategies can be successfully implemented to adapt the readout production even with finite-time measurements and limited dynamic resolution, and remain effective in the presence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a plausible mechanism to actively balance information and dissipation, paving the way for an implementable design principle underpinning biological and biochemical adaptation."

We report on the discovery of a reconfigurable magnetic multilayer domain structure in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr, exhibiting a unique combination of magnetic and optical properties. Applying an external magnetic field along the easy axis drives the hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition that is not universally binary, but instead develops through a cascade of intermediate magnetic configurations whose multiplicity and stability scale systematically with thickness. This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure. The directly linked optical properties of CrSBr, modulated by the magnetic structure, provide a readout mechanism for the stored information compatible with modern information distribution using light. With its adaptive properties, CrSBr is an attractive candidate for neuromorphic circuitries, enabling the design of brain-inspired computing architectures that can learn and evolve in response to changing environments."

Here we demonstrate that three universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) - MACE-MATPES-PBE-0, Orb-v3, and SevenNet-0 can efficiently map the energetics of C, N, O, and H interstitials in a Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy while being several orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory (DFT). All uMLIPs predict broad energy distributions (1-3 eV) for all four interstitial elements, reflecting their strong sensitivity to local lattice chemistry. Despite alloy disorder, MACE-MATPES-PBE-0 and Orb-v3 reproduce the expected site preferences of the bcc structure: C, N, and O relax into octahedral sites, whereas H stabilizes in tetrahedral positions. In contrast, SevenNet-0 predicts H to be most stable in octahedral coordination, indicating a limitation of this model. Correlation analysis reveals two dominant chemical trends: Ti-rich environments strongly stabilize interstitials, whereas close proximity to Nb is destabilizing; Zr and Ta show no statistically significant influence, likely due to their low concentrations. Benchmarking representative O interstitial configurations against DFT confirms that the uMLIPs reasonably reproduce the energetic ordering of chemically distinct environments. Overall, these results demonstrate that uMLIPs enable computationally efficient, statistically converged characterization of defect energetics in gum metal base alloy and provide insight into how local chemical environments govern interstitial stability."

      "summary": "We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries, including anomalous and non-invertible symmetries, and also serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. We also discuss constraints on SIMPS fusion and propose a general framework for fusion that encompasses the MPS and SIMPS protocols. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting insights from data, but their training is hindered by the slow mixing of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) processes, especially with highly structured datasets. In this study, we build on recent theoretical advances in RBM training and focus on the stepwise encoding of data patterns into singular vectors of the coupling matrix, significantly reducing the cost of generating new samples and evaluating the quality of the model, as well as the training cost in highly clustered datasets. The learning process is analogous to the thermodynamic continuous phase transitions observed in ferromagnetic models, where new modes in the probability measure emerge in a continuous manner. We leverage the continuous transitions in the training process to define a smooth annealing trajectory that enables reliable and computationally efficient log-likelihood estimates. This approach enables online assessment during training and introduces a novel sampling strategy called Parallel Trajectory Tempering (PTT) that outperforms previously optimized MCMC methods. To mitigate the critical slowdown effect in the early stages of training, we propose a pre-training phase. In this phase, the principal components are encoded into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization process, facilitating efficient static Monte Carlo sampling and accurate computation of the partition function. Our results demonstrate that this pre-training strategy allows RBMs to efficiently handle highly structured datasets where conventional methods fail. Additionally, our log-likelihood estimation outperforms computationally intensive approaches in controlled scenarios, while the PTT algorithm significantly accelerates MCMC processes compared to conventional methods."

Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence, and has been confirmed to great accuracy for large bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase, equal to the quantum phase of a free-falling object. To measure this phase, we realize a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave-packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. The observed relative-phase of the wave-packets confirms the predicted phase of a free-falling object, and shows that in our low energy regime, the equivalence principle may be applied to the quantum domain. Our observation constitutes a fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics."

Conventional semiclassical treatments typically attribute these effects to nonlinear interactions associated with the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons. Here, we present a phenomenological microscopic model that not only recovers these anomalous-velocity contributions, but also incorporates interband effects that become significant at higher frequencies. Our model captures a wide range of nonlinear interactions while remaining consistent with passivity and microscopic reversibility. Using this broader framework, we study the nonlinear interactions between free and bound electrons as an alternative mechanism for optical gain. We show that, under non-equilibrium conditions in low-symmetry conductors, the linearized electromagnetic response can exhibit both nonreciprocity and gain, even without anomalous velocity contributions. Finally, we analyze the stability of electrically biased systems and highlight potential applications such as optical isolators and traveling-wave amplifiers."

Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors."

We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond timescales.Our extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations.

As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\\\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval."

The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level properties. We first introduce HELM (\"Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure Learning for Molecules\"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set (def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for representing chemical space."

Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\\mathrm{A}^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 2012, 535, 17-20], we conducted a targeted spectroscopic search and report the first observation of the lowest vibrational level of the $\\mathrm{b}^{3}\\Pi_{0}$ state in $^{6}\\mathrm{Li}^{40}\\mathrm{K}$. The transition frequency from $|\\mathrm{X}^{1}\\Sigma^{+},\\,v=0,\\,J=0>$ to $|\\mathrm{b}^{3}\\Pi_{0},\\,v'=0,\\,J'=1>$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\\mathrm{b}^{3}\\Pi_{0},\\,v'=0>$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\\mathrm{b}^{3}\\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\\mathrm{b}^{3}\\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0>$ and $|\\mathrm{X}^{1}\\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0>$ of $hc\\times$10,481.03(2) $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\\mathrm{b}^{3}\\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times."

The problem is obtained as an expansion over the dry modes of the elastic plate, which are computed using a Rayleigh--Ritz method. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry."

We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a novel class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional columnar dimerized Heisenberg model. Notably, the observed transitions do not fall into any previously established universality classes. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional systems. In addition, the representation provides a natural interpretation of the phase transitions in terms of cluster formation within the simulations. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems."

The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to variable qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing."

This review focuses on self-interacting dark matter scenarios, their implications on the dynamics and distribution of dark matter halos in the Universe, and the related astrophysical tests and observations, from galaxies to large-scale structures. It is embedded in the framework of the Novel Probes Project, a forum connecting observers and theorists involved in the study of astrophysical tests of dark-sector interactions. [Rev. Mod.
