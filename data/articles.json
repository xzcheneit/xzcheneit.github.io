Likewise, quantum resources have the potential to enhance cryptography in ways that go beyond the well-known example of quantum key distribution. This review offers a classification of the main crypto primitives that are available quantum mechanically. It explains the security that they offer, including the sometimes significant limitations on their theoretical capabilities. Implementations using current photonic techniques are discussed. [Rev.

These phenomena result from a fixed-point annihilation within the critical manifold and can be gradually tuned into each other. In contrast to higher-dimensional systems, the spin-boson model allows for numerical simulations with unprecedented precision and detailed comparisons with analytical predictions. [Phys. Rev.
