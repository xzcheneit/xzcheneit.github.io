The mechanism proposed in this study uses a ground-based modulated rf signal to resonantly excite plasma oscillations in the ionosphere’s F layer, creating low-frequency signals that propagate back to the earth’s surface. The authors find that a 94-GHz signal, modulated at 9 MHz and operated at 1 MW, can generate a 9-MHz signal on the ground, 500 km from the interaction regime in the ionosphere, at intensities sufficient for detection. This points to practical mobile radar units and atmospheric monitoring. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 054040] Published Thu Nov 13, 2025"
