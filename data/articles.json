      "summary": "Valley topology has emerged as a key concept for realizing new classes of quantum states. Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe2 and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe2, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices."

      "summary": "The coupled entropy is proven to uniquely satisfy the requirement that a generalized entropy be equivalent to the density at the scale for scale-shape distributions. Further, its maximizing distributions, the coupled stretched exponential distributions, are proven to quantify the linear uncertainty with the scale and the nonlinear uncertainty with the shape for a broad class of complex systems. Distributions of the coupled exponentials include the Pareto Types I-IV and Gosset's Student-t. For the Pareto Type II distribution, the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy has a linear dependence on the shape, which dominates over the logarithmic dependence on the scale, motivating the need for a generalization. The R\\'enyi and Tsallis entropies are shown to be of historic importance but ultimately unsatisfactory generalizations. The coupled entropy of the coupled stretched exponential distribution isolates the nonlinear-shape dependence to a generalized logarithm of the partition function. The R\\'enyi and Tsallis entropies retain a strong dependence on the nonlinear-shape such that they are not equivalent to the uncertainty at the scale. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven in support of an axiomatic definition. The scope of the coupled entropy includes systems in which the growth of states is power-law, stretched exponential, or a combination."

      "summary": "The functional renormalization group (fRG) is acknowledged as a powerful tool in quantum many-body physics and beyond. On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon."

      "summary": "Impacted with sufficiently large stress, a dense, initially liquid-like suspension can be forced into a solid-like state through the process of shear jamming. While the onset of shear jamming has been investigated extensively, less is known about the resulting solid-like state in the high stress limit and its failure. We experimentally produce such high-stress failure by impacting dense suspensions at a controlled speed. Using cornstarch suspensions we vary impact speed over several orders of magnitude and change fluid viscosity and surface tension in order to identify the conditions for failure. The results are compared with dense suspensions of potato starch or silica particles. In the case of fracture, we observe two types of cracks: a primary circular crack around the impactor followed by secondary radial cracks. Mapping out the onset of radial fracturing for different volume fractions and impact speeds, we identify the requirements for failure via crack formation to occur with at least 50% likelihood. We find that this likelihood is not sensitive to changes in particle diameter, but increases when the solvent's viscosity or surface tension are reduced. In the state diagram for dense suspensions we delineate the upper limit of shear-jammed rigidity and the crossover into a fracture regime at large volume fraction and normal stress, several orders of magnitude above the onset stress for shear-jamming. We find that the onset of fracturing in many cases is correlated with internal ductile deformation of the shear-jammed material underneath the impactor, observable in normal stress as a function of axial strain. For small suspension volumes and large impact speeds, we find strain-hardening up until fracturing. This more brittle behavior results in a modulus that, just before crack formation, is an order of magnitude larger than in shear-jammed suspensions undergoing ductile deformation."

      "summary": "Efficiently and meaningfully estimating prediction uncertainty is important for exploration in active learning campaigns in materials discovery, where samples with high uncertainty are interpreted as containing information missing from the model. In this work, the effect of different uncertainty estimation and calibration methods are evaluated for active learning when using ensembles of ALIGNN, eXtreme Gradient Boost, Random Forest, and Neural Network model architectures. We compare uncertainty estimates from ALIGNN deep ensembles to loss landscape uncertainty estimates obtained for solubility, bandgap, and formation energy prediction tasks. We then evaluate how the quality of the uncertainty estimate impacts an active learning campaign that seeks model generalization to out-of-distribution data. Uncertainty calibration methods were found to variably generalize from in-domain data to out-of-domain data. Furthermore, calibrated uncertainties were generally unsuccessful in reducing the amount of data required by a model to improve during an active learning campaign on out-of-distribution data when compared to random sampling and uncalibrated uncertainties. The impact of poor-quality uncertainty persists for random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models trained on the same data for the same tasks, indicating that this is at least partially intrinsic to the data and not due to model capacity alone. Analysis of the target, in-distribution uncertainty, out-of-distribution uncertainty, and training residual distributions suggest that future work focus on understanding empirical uncertainties in the feature input space for cases where ensemble prediction variances do not accurately capture the missing information required for the model to generalize."

      "summary": "The study of synthetic active matter systems holds the promise for designing smart materials and devices with emergent characteristics akin to those of living organisms, eventually opening the doors to the realization of artificial life. Such an investigation, however, is challenged by the difficulty inherent in identifying the relationship between the features of the elementary constituents and the emergent properties of the whole; to this end, a key step consists in the accurate quantification of the system's observed behavior. Here, we report the study of 50 self-propelled oil droplets floating on the surface of an aqueous solution. 25 droplets are stained with a red dye, and the other 25 are stained blue: the colorants affect the droplets' interfacial tension properties differently, consequently influencing their collective dynamics. Droplet trajectories extending for up to 5 hours are extracted from video recordings with a tracking pipeline developed ad hoc. The structural and dynamical analysis of the system reveals a ``life-to-death'' cycle unfolding in qualitatively distinct stages, showcasing a complex interplay between individual droplet mobility and collective organization. The tools developed and the results obtained in our work pave the way to the in silico modelling as well as the experimental design of synthetic active matter systems displaying life-like and programmable behavior."

Here we demonstrate double descent in a decentralized analog network of self-adjusting resistive elements. This system trains itself and performs tasks without a digital processor, offering potential gains in energy efficiency and speed -- but must endure component non-idealities. We find that standard training fails to yield double descent, but a modified protocol that accommodates this inherent imperfection succeeds. Our findings show that analog physical systems, if appropriately trained, can exhibit behaviors underlying the success of digital AI. Further, they suggest that biological systems might similarly benefit from over-parameterization."

      "summary": "Dissipation anomaly-the persistence of finite energy dissipation in the inviscid limit-is a hallmark of turbulence, sometimes regarded as the \"zeroth law\" of turbulent flows. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not exclusive to turbulence. Using fluctuating hydrodynamics, we show that a simple gradient-driven nonequilibrium steady state, in which a fluid is subjected to a constant scalar gradient but remains macroscopically quiescent, also exhibits dissipation anomaly. Direct numerical simulations and self-consistent mode-coupling theory reveal that the anomaly originates from giant, long-range nonequilibrium fluctuations amplified by the imposed gradient. While linear theory predicts a divergent dissipation in the inviscid limit, nonlinear mode coupling regularizes the divergence, yielding a finite anomalous dissipation. Our findings identify a new, non-turbulent arena for dissipation anomaly and establish the interplay between thermal noise and nonequilibrium driving as a fundamental route to singular behavior in hydrodynamics."

      "summary": "Block copolymer (BCP) melts play a critical role in the design of thermoplastics, owing in large part to the creation of alternating nano-scale domains of soft and stiff components. Much of thermoplastic design has been focused on the short-time response associated with the dynamical rigidity of rubbery or glassy chains. However, less attention has been paid to the long-time relaxation and rigidity of microphase separated BCP melts or the role that domain morphology plays in modulating near-equilibrium response. We take advantage of the ability of self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to calculate equilibrium properties of BCP melts to explore the anisotropic elastic response of ordered ABA and AB copolymer melts as quasistatic deformation processes. This allows us to determine the anisotropic stiffness of the liquid crystal-like lamellar and columnar phases due to modulations in domain spacing, as well as the full stiffness tensor of the cubic BCC sphere and double gyroid phases. We explore elastic modulus landscapes for both single grain materials and random polycrystals over architectural parameters and segregation strengths, using AB diblock and ABA triblock melts as key examples. Finally, we re-examine basic assumptions of BCP melts as simple composites, dependence of melt stiffness on domain spacing, and the role of bridging chain conformations in altering melt relaxation, providing evidence for an interplay between mass transport and domain topology that remains to be understood."

      "summary": "Matter under high pressure often exhibits attractive properties, which, unfortunately, are typically irretrievable when released to ambient conditions. Intuitively, nanostructure engineering might provide a promising route to contain high-pressure phase of materials because of the exceptional mechanical strength at nanoscale. However, there is no available theoretical model that can analyze this possibility, not to mention to quantitatively evaluate the pressure-bearing capability of nano-cavities. Here, a physical model is proposed to appraise the absolute theoretical limit of various nanotubes/nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials to ambient conditions. By incorporating with first-principles calculations, we screen and select four types of representative nanomaterials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), biphenylene, and {\\gamma}-graphyne, and perform systematic investigations. The results indicate that nanotube/nanosphere of graphene exhibits the best pressure-bearing capability, followed by h-BN, biphenylene and {\\gamma}-graphyne. Our model reveals that the structure with the largest average binding energy per bond and the highest density of bonds will have the highest absolute limit to contain pressure materials, while electron/hole doping and interlayer interactions have minor effects. Our finding suggests that one can utilize nanotube/nanosphere with multiple layers to retrieve compressed material with higher pressures. For example, a single layer graphene sphere can retrieve compressed LaH10 with a volume size of 26 nm3 that corresponding to a pressure of 170 GPa and with a near room temperature superconductor transition of Tc=250 K. Similarly, in order to retrieve the metastable atomic hydrogen or molecular metallic hydrogen at about 250 GPa, it requires only three layers of a nanosphere to contain a volume size of 173 nm^3."

      "summary": "The dynamic slowdown in glass-forming liquids remains a central topic in condensed matter science. Here, we report a theoretical investigation of the microscopic origin of the slowdown in amorphous silica, a prototypical strong glass former with a tetrahedral network structure. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze atomic jump dynamics, the elementary structural change processes underlying relaxation. We find that the jump statistics deviate from Poisson behavior with decreasing temperature, reflecting the emergence of dynamic disorder in which slowly evolving variables modulate the jump motion. The slowdown is species-dependent: for silicon, the primary constraint arises from the fourth-nearest oxygen neighbor, while at lower temperatures, the fourth-nearest silicon also becomes relevant; for oxygen, the dominant influence comes from the second-nearest silicon neighbors. As the system is cooled, the jump dynamics become increasingly slow and intermittent, proceeding in a higher-dimensional space of multiple slow variables that reflect cooperative rearrangements of the network. Species-resolved point-to-set correlations further reveal that the spatial extent of cooperative relaxation grows differently for silicon and oxygen, directly linking their relaxation asymmetry to the extent of collective motion. Together, these results provide a microscopic framework linking dynamic disorder, species-dependent constraints, and cooperative correlations, offering deeper insight into the slowdown of strong glass-forming networks."

      "summary": "This work involves the local structural investigation of the samples using Extended X-ray Absorption Spectra (EXAFS) analysis to investigate structural changes due to the Ca and Mn-modified BaTiO3. TEM investigation of the crystal structure reveals the coexistence of the tetragonal and hexagonal phases of BaTiO3. Band gap modification and Urbach tail variation in UV-DRS measurements reveal a reduction of band gap from UV to Visible range (3.2 eV to 2 eV). This band gap change is correlated with the valence band modification observed in PES measurements due to localised defects in the material, and supported by theoretical Density of States calculations. The electron localisation function calculation is used to analyse the changes in the localised electron density near the dopant atoms. It reveals the local expansion and contraction of the lattice surrounding the dopant atom. All these structural modifications lead to variations in the dielectric properties and diffusive nature of the phase transition. The defect-induced structural modifications, multiple phase coexistence, band gap variations and dielectric properties are explored and correlated."

The instrument combines a Wolter type-I mirror for spatial imaging with a varied-line-spacing grating spectrometer, simultaneously achieving micrometer-scale spatial resolution and ultrahigh energy resolution in the soft x-ray regime. Test chart measurements confirm a vertical spatial resolution of 1.0 um near the field-of-view center, and the horizontal resolution determined by the incident beam footprint is 0.8 um. RIXS imaging capabilities have been demonstrated by the measurements of a patterned NanoTerasu logo and exfoliated NiPS${}_3$ nanoflakes, highlighting its efficiency in locating specific microscale regions within inhomogeneous samples.

Within this framework, the explicit-core Delta SCF scheme enables shift-free absolute edge alignment and a consistent treatment of L/M edges with spin-orbit-resolved projectors. In addition, by exploiting dipole selection rules, we recast the evaluation of the dipole matrix elements, which otherwise requires many independent Slater determinant calculations, into a compact single determinant form. This reduces the computational scaling from $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of electrons, without introducing additional approximations. Across representative C, B, O, and Li K-edge benchmarks in molecules and solids, the method reproduces line shapes, polarization anisotropies, and absolute onsets without empirical shifts, providing a robust and scalable route to quantitatively reliable XAS simulations within DFT."

However, even when both the crystal structure and chemical composition are fixed, material properties can still vary depending on the atomic arrangements (configurations) at crystallographic sites. To support detailed material design, we present PyAPX, a Python toolkit that performs Bayesian searches of stable atomic configurations. A distinctive feature of this initial release is the introduction of encoding methods suitable for configuration search, and we evaluate their performance using the h-BCN system. As a result, they were confirmed to yield superior convergence compared to commonly used one-hot encoding. PyAPX is broadly applicable to crystalline materials and is expected to further advance materials discovery."

In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum."

In the single-particle framework, we introduce the one-particle irreducible 1PI effective action formalism taking explicitly into account the choice of the initial quantum state, its saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuation approximation, and its finite temperature extension via Matsubara summation. This yields a clear physical interpretation in terms of zero-point and thermal contributions to the Helmholtz free energy. The formalism is then applied to the GP action producing the 1PI effective potential at zero and finite temperature including beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang and thermal corrections. We discuss the gapless and gapped Bogoliubov spectra, their relevance to equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, and the role of regularization. Applications include the inclusion of an external potential within the local density approximation, the derivation of finite-temperature Josephson equations, and the extension to D dimensional systems. This unified approach provides a transparent connection between microscopic quantum fluctuations and effective macroscopic equations of motion for Bose-Einstein condensates."

Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly in regard to the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. Without loss of generality, the proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor model, known for its predictive capability and adaptability to fit a large number of resistance switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences, that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor state. The theoretical approach is also extended to cover situations, where a fast programming scheme should be adopted to serve time-critical electronics applications."

In this work, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the pyrochlore superconductor CsBi2 and spin liquid Pr2Ir2O7 at 0.3 K. For the first time, we obtained atomically resolved images of their (111) surfaces, revealing a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy in CsBi2 reveals a nearly fully opened superconductivity gap. The ratio of 2{\\Delta}/kBTC = 4.7 suggests relatively strong coupling superconductivity, as compared with that in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs). In contrast to the previous study categorizing CsBi2 as a type-I superconductor, the applied magnetic field induces a hexagonal vortex lattice in which each vortex core exhibits an intriguing three-fold symmetry state. In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence. We discuss the relations of these many-body electronic phenomena with the pyrochlore lattice geometry and its charge or spin frustration. Our systematic observations offer atomic-scale insights into the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductors and spin liquids."

Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values. One-order of magnitude overestimation of diffusion coefficients compared with some experiments suggests a substantial impact of hydrogen trapping by defects such as Cr vacancies and Ti anti-sites in non-stoichiometric TiCr$_2$ in experiments."

While well understood for passive systems, how this process is regulated by active agents such as motile bacteria remains largely unexplored. By combining experiments on Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a prototypical dextran-polyethylene glycol ATPS with hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the interplay between bacterial activity and interfacial wetting gives rise to a robust sequence of nonequilibrium morphologies, including self-spinning droplets, elongated droplet chains, branched capillary-like clusters, and highly deformed droplets. We find that activity plays a dual role in coarsening kinetics: it suppresses coarsening through hydrodynamically driven, activity-induced droplet rotation, yet accelerates it when dextran is the minority phase, where wetting-mediated attraction governs bacterial aggregation. These findings reveal a generic physical mechanism through which motility and wetting cooperatively control phase-separation dynamics, offering new physical insight into activity-regulated LLPS and suggesting strategies for engineering ATPS morphology using active agents."

In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate the realization of the Josephson diode effect in an atomtronic circuit consisting of a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate and with optical barriers serving as Josephson junctions. Our implementation of this macroscopic non-reciprocal quantum phenomenon is based on realizing the required inversion symmetry breaking through asymmetric barrier placement and an asymmetric alternating current (AC) drive, enabling position- and drive-tunable diode effects with efficiencies up to 15% and 91%, respectively. While standard time-of-flight absorption imaging can readily observe these effects, we employ cavity optomechanics for in situ, real-time, and non-destructive measurements of the relevant condensate dynamics. Our results establish a highly tunable platform for nonreciprocal Josephson transport, opening avenues for diode-based neutral-atom technologies in future quantum circuits."

      "summary": "Materials, at their essence, are networks defined by homogeneity: uniform bonds, fixed thicknesses, and discrete length scales. Mechanical metamaterials, while representing structurally more diverse microstructures, remain defined by the homogeneity of their unit cells, pore sizes, or repeating features. In contrast, as network science has revealed, real-world and biological systems -- from the Internet to the brain -- derive their function from broad, multiscale variability in connectivity and link length. Here, we introduce Scale-Rich (SR) metamaterials, a design framework that embeds network heterogeneity into mechanical metamaterials, achieving order-of-magnitude heterogeneity in ligament lengths, thicknesses, and connectivity. Governed by only two parameters, SR networks span orders of magnitude in structural features, overcoming prior constraints in metamaterial design. Translating these network models into physically realizable materials, we use simulations and experiments to show that SR metamaterials exhibit properties inaccessible to traditional single-scale systems, including highly tunable elastic anisotropy, delocalized nonlinear deformation with high energy absorption, and programmable acoustic wave control. This network-science-based paradigm establishes a minimal yet universal framework for engineering multifunctional materials whose mechanical and acoustic behavior emerge directly from scale diversity itself."

      "summary": "While true phase transitions are forbidden in one-dimensional systems with short-range interactions, several models have recently been shown to exhibit sharp yet analytic thermodynamic anomalies that mimic thermal phase transitions. We show that this behavior arises from transfer matrices that are mathematically irreducible but possess a nearly block-diagonal structure due to the weak contribution of off-diagonal Boltzmann weights in the low-temperature regime. This results in weakly coupled competing sectors whose eigenvalue competition produces abrupt crossovers without nonanalyticity, a mechanism we term nearly block-diagonal irreducible. A key thermodynamic signature of such pseudotransitions is that the residual entropy at the interface remains bounded between the residual entropies of the competing sectors. We develop a general spectral framework to describe this behavior and apply it to two representative models: the Ising chain with internal degeneracy (Doniach model) and a hexagonal nanowire chain with mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 components. In the first case, we derive exact expressions for the pseudo-critical temperature and residual entropy. In the second, we reduce the full $1458\\times1458$ transfer matrix via symmetry decomposition and construct a low-rank effective matrix that accurately captures the crossover between quasi-ferromagnetic and quasi-core-ferromagnetic regimes. Our results demonstrate that pseudotransitions can be understood as spectral phenomena emerging from irreducible but functionally decoupled structures within the transfer matrix."

Here, we experimentally demonstrate highly energy-efficient, voltage-driven magnetization switching in MTJs exhibiting large tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR), enabled by a remote doping technique that precisely controls the iridium (Ir) concentration near the MgO-CoFeB interface in the free layer. Our devices achieve a switching energy of only 3.5 fJ per bit for nanoscale MTJs operating in the sub-nanosecond regime, while maintaining a TMR ratio up to 160 percent after 400 C post-annealing. These findings establish a viable pathway toward scalable, ultra-low-power nonvolatile memory, positioning voltage-driven MTJs as strong contenders for next-generation magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) and other emerging spintronic applications."

      "summary": "Al1-xScxN has attracted significant interest due to its large remnant polarization and low processing temperature when compared to other ferroelectric material systems. However, device dielectric failure before ferroelectric switching remains a critical limitation for AlScN-based memory devices. With the continuing trend toward device miniaturization, expanding the operating window is essential for next-generation memory development. In this work, we optimized the breakdown field (EBD) and coercive field (EC) in ultra-thin Al1-xScxN films by controlling defect density via adjustment of nitrogen gas flow during sputter deposition. The characteristic breakdown field, EBD, was evaluated using Weibull statistics, yielding optimal characteristic breakdown fields of 12.47 MV/cm (EBD+) and -12.63 MV/cm (EBD-) for samples deposited under 27.5 sccm N2 flow. The minimum EC was achieved at a nitrogen flow of 25 sccm and increased for higher gas flows, a trend that is opposite to previous reports in much thicker films. The highest EBD over EC ratio of 2.25 occurred at 27.5 sccm, effectively expanding the operational window. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy to study changes in crystal orientation and defects, device performance can be tuned by controlling the point defect concentration in the ultra-thin film via adjusting the sputtering N2 process gas flow rate."

      "summary": "Transition-metal halides V$X_3$ ($X$ = Br and I) have emerged as promising candidates for two dimensional spintronic and quantum applications due to their layer-dependent magnetism and tunable electronic states. However, experimental insights into their ground state electronic structures remain limited. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of V$X_3$ using high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) combined with ligand field multiplet calculations. The RIXS spectra reveal distinct $dd$ and charge-transfer excitations, allowing precise determination of electronic structure parameters, including the crystal field splitting, trigonal distortion, and Racah parameters. The determined parameters showed clear variation, indicating an increase in covalency from Br to I. The trigonal distortion parameters $\\Delta_{D_{3d}}$ were determined to be -0.096 eV in VBr$_3$ and 0.07 eV in VI$_3$, indicating a sign opposition between the two compounds, reflecting good agreement with experimental RIXS data. Cluster model calculations yield a high-spin V$^{3+}$ $(S = 1)$ configuration, with an $e'^2_g$ ground state in VBr$_3$ and an $e'^1_ga^1_{1g}$ ground state in VI$_3$, consistent with trigonal elongation and compression, respectively. Our findings provide the most complete experimental determination of the low energy electronic structure in V$X_3$, offering valuable insights for designing 2D magnetic and spintronic materials based on vanadium halides."

Thus, they are good candidates for investigating the MCE. We characterize the MCE using standard metrics and construct ternary phase diagrams as functions of Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations. Using these phase diagrams, we engineer the composition NdFe$_{1.15}$Co$_{0.46}$Ni$_{2.39}$B to maximize the MCE. Interestingly, the Nd$T_4$B system shows a notable entropy change over a wide temperature range ($\\sim$10 to 650 K), and particular compositions have notable MCEs spanning hundreds of Kelvin, making this a suitable system to study for technologies used in a wide range of temperatures. In a few cases, we observe a two-peak MCE. These two transitions, releasing comparable entropy, provide an interesting platform to study for applications in multi-stage cooling."

For the one-sided absorbing boundary on the semi-infinite line, we find that the FPT density scales as $t^{-1/(2\\alpha)-1}$, in agreement with the method of images but in violation of the Sparre-Andersen scaling. In this case, there exists an optimal space-fractional exponent $\\alpha$ to minimize the mean FPT."

      "summary": "A fundamentally intriguing yet not well understood topic in the field of ferroelectrics is the collective excitation of domain walls (DWs), with potential applications to DW-based nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices. Here we use dynamical phase-field simulations to identify the collective modes of an Ising-type $180^{\\circ}$ DW in a uniaxially strained BaTiO3 membrane. The membrane concurrently functions as a cavity for polarization and acoustic waves and permits cavity-enhanced resonant excitation of polarization waves. The simulation reveals an unconventional DW sliding mode that exhibits a depolarization-field-driven nonzero resonant frequency and a dynamically changing internal structure during sliding. These features differ from the previously reported DW sliding modes that have a zero resonant frequency or a rigid internal structure. An analytical model is developed to quantitatively understand the origin of this new DW mode and predict the effect of strain on the mode frequency. The analytically predicted strain dependence of the frequencies of the unconventional DW sliding mode and the DW breathing mode, both in the terahertz regime, is further validated by dynamical phase-field simulations. These results provide new insights into the high-frequency dynamics of ferroelectric DWs and suggest opportunities for realizing on-demand control of phonon-DW resonance by strain, and more broadly, discovering and controlling unconventional DW modes in conventional domain patterns, with applications to reconfigurable THz and optical devices."

      "summary": "In this paper, we formulate the real-space Chern number in a supercell framework. In this framework, the overlap matrix between two corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is derived from diagonalizing the real-space Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. The pass-ordered product of overlap matrices around the BZ boundary forms a Wilson loop, and defines the Chern number in real space. It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization. By contrast, the phase diagram is almost unaffected by polarized disorder, indicating that nontrivial topology persists against disorder. These observations are supported by the linear conductance and the density of bulk states."

This two-parameter family interpolates continuously between short-range Anderson-like disorder, correlated disorder with conventional hopping, and long-range hopping models with nontrivial delocalization tendencies. Using large-scale exact diagonalization, we construct a comprehensive phase map in the $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ plane by combining spectral statistics, density-of-states analysis, and energy-resolved localization indicators such as the participation ratio, single-particle entanglement entropy, level-spacing ratio $r$, and the ratio of the geometric to arithmetic density of states. From these observables we define phase-indicator functions that compactly quantify localization behaviour across the spectrum. Our analysis reveals robust mobility edges and multiple regimes of spectral coexistence between localized, extended, resonant, and critical states. Finite-size scaling, implemented via an explicit smoothness-based cost function, enables extraction of critical exponents and delineation of transition lines across the $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ parameter space. To validate and complement these physics-based diagnostics, we employ a supervised autoencoder that learns high-level representations of eigenstate structure directly from raw features and reliably reproduces the phase classification defined by the indicator functions. Together, these approaches provide a coherent and internally consistent picture of the spectral transitions driven by correlated disorder and long-range hopping, establishing a unified framework for characterizing mobility edges in long-range one-dimensional systems."

Recent theoretical studies, however, have demonstrated the existence of topological phases in quasicrystals that are absent in crystals. Despite numerous experimental observations of topological phases in various crystalline systems, observing these phases without crystalline counterparts remains challenging due to very complex models. Here, we design a practically realizable tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. This model respects eight-fold rotational and chiral symmetries, resulting in a higher-order topological phase with eight zero-energy corner modes that have no crystalline counterparts. We experimentally explore the topological phase in an acoustic quasicrystal. Surprisingly, we also discover symmetry-protected zero-energy modes near the center of the quasicrystal in a topologically trivial phase, a phenomenon not seen in crystals. We further experimentally observe these modes in a topologically trivial acoustic quasicrystal. Our work represents the first experimental observation of topological phases in quasicrystals without crystalline counterparts, paving the way for the study of exotic topological physics in quasicrystals."

Using a Laplace-transform moment hierarchy, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean velocity, velocity-orientation projections, velocity autocorrelation, mean-squared velocity, mean-squared displacement, and the fourth moment of velocity. These results agree quantitatively with simulations over all masses, activities, and chiralities. We show that the velocity autocorrelation factorizes into an inertial envelope and a chiral envelope. Despite rich transients in the velocity sector, the long-time positional diffusion equals the overdamped cABP value, independent of mass. From the steady mean-squared velocity, we define a kinetic temperature and a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation whose violation vanishes in two limits: large mass or large chirality, identifying chirality as an additional route to equilibrium-like behavior. The steady-state velocity excess kurtosis gives a phase map that exhibits a (Gaussian-like)-active(bimodal)-(Gaussian-like) re-entrance with mass; chirality confines activity and shrinks the active sector. A narrow positive-kurtosis window emerges at large mass and intermediate chirality, with analytic boundaries consistent with the heavy-mass asymptote."

Existing {\\it ab initio} methods either capture bias-dependent transport but neglect dynamical correlations or include correlations but are restricted to equilibrium or linear-response regimes. To overcome these limitations, we present a framework for steady-state quantum transport, combining density functional theory (DFT), the non-equilibrium Greens' function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The framework is then applied to Cu/Co/vacuum/Cu and an Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction. In Co, correlations drive a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior under finite bias, due to scattering of electrons with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments."

Although current-induced magnetic moment accumulation is crucial both for fundamental understanding and practical applications, direct quantifications are scarce. Optical polarization measurements, namely magneto-optical Kerr rotation (MOKE) ($\\theta_K$), have been used to get direct evidence of magnetic accumulation perpendicular to a current flow density ($J$) in late transition metals (Pt) as well as in light transition elements (Ti, Cr), and used to conclude evidence of spin or orbital momentum accumulation. However, discrepancies of the reported $\\theta_K/J$ values, exceeding one order of magnitude, together with early claims that conventional MOKE experiments were not a suitable tool, is prompting revisions of methods and results. Here, we report on a new methodology for MOKE measurements that solves known bottlenecks. We obtain a sensitivity of $(354 \\pm 27)$ nV/nrad and use the designed protocol to measure $|\\theta_K^S/J| = (7.92 \\pm 1.94)$ nrad/$(10^7$ A/cm$^2)$ and $|\\theta_K^P/J| = (6.89 \\pm 1.74)$ nrad/$(10^7$ A/cm$^2)$ in a 50 nm thick Pt bar for S and P polarized incident light, respectively.The extracted value of $|\\theta_K^S/J|$ is significantly smaller, about a 7-fold reduction, than previous results on a nominally identical device. Given that differences in the microstructure of Pt films cannot account for such large discrepancy, this implies that experimental procedures and models should be revised accordingly."

We introduce an iterative bicolored percolation process in two dimensions and show that it can both preserve and transform criticality. Starting from critical configurations, such as the O$(n)$ loop and fuzzy Potts models, successive coarse-graining generates a hierarchy of distinct yet critical generations. Using the conformal loop ensemble, we derive exact, generation-dependent fractal dimensions, which are quantitatively confirmed by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The evolutionary trajectory depends not only on the universality class of the initial state but also on whether it possesses a two-state critical structure, leading to different critical exponents starting from site and bond percolation. These results establish a general geometric mechanism for evolving criticality, in which scale invariance persists across generations."

Our method advances the fabrication of nanofluidic and 2D heterostructure devices, facilitating applications in quantum transport, photonics, energy harvesting, and sensing technologies requiring high-throughput, contamination-free heterostructure architectures."

      "summary": "L\\'evy noise influences diverse non-equilibrium systems across scales, including quantum devices, active biological matter, and financial markets. While such noise is pervasive, its overall impact on activated transitions between metastable states remains unclear, despite prior studies of specific noise forms and scaling limits. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for L\\'evy noise defined by its finite intensity and independent stationary increments. By identifying the most probable transition paths as minimizers of a stochastic action functional, we derive analytical scaling laws for escape rates under weak noise, thereby extending the classical Arrhenius law. Our results demonstrate that L\\'evy noise universally enhances escape efficiency by reducing the effective potential barrier compared to Gaussian noise with equivalent intensity. Strikingly, even vanishingly weak L\\'evy noise can exponentially increase escape rates across a broad range of amplitude distributions. This phenomenon arises from discontinuous most probable transition paths, where escape occurs via finite jumps. We validate these paths through the cumulant-generating function, a path integral representation, the mean first passage time and numerical simulations. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions in escape dynamics under thermal and athermal fluctuations, suggesting new strategies to optimize switching processes in metastable systems through engineering noise properties."

      "summary": "We develop a unified framework for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables that establishes master identities for exponential quadratic fermionic forms and linear fermionic forms coupled to both bosonic and fermionic sources. The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \\textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10). Overall, this work offers a flexible toolkit for the theoretical analysis and computational implementation of graph-based models and lattice field theories using Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables ."

Combining scaling arguments with analytic derivations and numerical analysis, we adapt the renormalization-group equations originally developed for the Efimov effect in a two-dimensional conformally invariant potential to the case of diffusion in $\\mathbb{H}^2$, thereby deriving the BKT-type divergence of the correlation length. We further demonstrate how the KPZ-type scaling governs the large-deviation behavior and survival probability near the boundary in the hyperbolic domain, and how Lifshitz tails arise naturally in a deterministic large-deviation landscape on the hyperbolic plane via instanton approach, reproducing the rare-event statistics of one-dimensional diffusion in the array of traps with the Poisson distribution. We conjecture that the dominant contribution to the ensemble of paths responsible for BKT-like physics comes from random paths pushed to large-deviation stretched regime."

Under the irradiation of righthanded circularly polarized light, we predict a three-stage topological phase transition in plumbene, whether it is in a free-standing form or grown on h-BN. Initially, a metallic state evolves into a K(K')-valley-based QAH state with a Chern number of -8, which then decreases to -6 after the valley gap closes. Finally, a band inversion occurs at the $\\Gamma$ point, resulting in a multichannel QAH state with C = -3. The trigonal warping model accounts for both K(K')-valley-based and $\\Gamma$-pointbased QAH states. Additionally, growing plumbene on a non-van-der-Waals substrate eliminates the K(K')-valley-based topology, leaving only the $\\Gamma$-point-based QAH state with C = +3. Our findings propose the tunability of various high Chern numbers derived from high-order topological insulators, aiming to advance the next-generation dissipationless electronic devices."

This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ through the modeling of relevant spectra obtained from synchrotron-based techniques widely used to probe electronic properties, with a primary focus on resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ru $L_3$ and O $K$ edges. The calculated spectra were thoroughly analyzed with available experimental data reported in the literature. The good agreement between our results and experimental observations for Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ enables a conclusive interpretation of key features in the spectra obtained from the aforementioned techniques. Consequently, this enables us to describe its electronic properties and to establish a solid theoretical approach suitable for routine modeling of spectra, particularly from RIXS, aimed at characterizing the electronic structure and properties of similar or more complex strongly correlated, technologically relevant materials."

      "summary": "Electric polarization in the absence of an externally applied electric field is a key property of polar materials, but the standard interpolation-based ab initio approach to compute polarization differences within the modern theory of polarization presents challenges for automated high-throughput calculations. Berry flux diagonalization [J. Bonini et. al, Phys. Rev. B 102, 045141 (2020)] has been proposed as an efficient and reliable alternative, though it has yet to be widely deployed. Here, we assess Berry flux diagonalization using ab initio calculations of a large set of materials, introducing and validating heuristics that ensure branch alignment with a minimal number of intermediate interpolated structures. Our automated implementation of Berry flux diagonalization succeeds in cases where prior interpolation-based workflows fail due to band-gap closures or branch ambiguities. Benchmarking with ab initio calculations of 176 candidate ferroelectrics, we demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on a broad range of insulating materials and obtain accurate effective polarization values with fewer interpolated structures than prior automated interpolation-based workflows. Our real-space heuristics that can predict gauge stability a priori from ionic displacements enable a general automated framework for reliable polarization calculations and efficient high-throughput screening of chemically and structurally diverse polar insulators. These results establish Berry flux diagonalization as a robust and efficient method to compute the effective polarization of solids and to accelerate the data-driven discovery of functional polar materials."

By applying an exact mapping to an effective Ising chain, we obtain the full thermodynamic description of the system through a compact transfer-matrix formulation. The ground-state analysis reveals five distinct phases, including two frustrated sectors with extensive degeneracy. These frustrated regions give rise to characteristic entropy plateaus and separate the ordered phases in the zero-temperature diagram. At low temperatures the model exhibits peculiar sharp yet continuous variations of entropy, magnetization, and response functions, reflecting clear signatures of pseudo-transition behavior. The coupled twin-diamond chain thus provides an exactly solvable setting in which competing local configurations and internal frustration lead to pronounced dual pseudo-critical features in one dimension."

For $t'\\leq 0$, the ground-state appears to be a charge-density wave (CDW) of one sort or another with SC correlations that are extremely short-ranged. In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'>0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit. These results were obtained employing matrix-product states with bond dimensions large enough that energy differences as small as $10^{-3}t$ per site can be resolved."

Among them, the Lopez-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet (LMC) statistical complexity has been widely cited due to its simplicity and analytic tractability. Here, we examine the performance and limitations of the LMC measure in a controlled physical setting: a two-dimensional XY model studied through Monte Carlo simulations. By computing LMC complexity at each step of the system's relaxation dynamics, and directly comparing these values with the evolving dipole configurations, we show that LMC complexity systematically fails to identify states of high structural complexity. In particular, the measure often assigns maximal complexity to nearly equilibrated configurations while underestimating vortex-rich intermediate states. We further show that the time derivative of LMC complexity contains more meaningful dynamical information. We propose that future measures incorporate directionality and dynamical sensitivity to better reflect the emergence and decay of organization in nonequilibrium systems."

However, in high-symmetry structures, polarization is constrained by symmetry operations and becomes quantized into discrete values. We demonstrate that this quantized polarization (QP) is not a mathematical artifact but a \\emph{symmetry-protected invariant} that encodes intrinsic information about a material's symmetry and electronic structure. Because of its discrete and non-continuous nature, when two materials with different QPs form an interface, their bulk polarization states cannot be connected adiabatically, compelling the system to develop pronounced interfacial responses: such as metallic states, bound charges, or strong lattice distortions. This theoretical framework provides a unified reinterpretation of classical systems such as the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, revealing it as a prototypical case of QP mismatch. By establishing QP as a fundamental bulk invariant, our work uncovers a universal mechanism governing interfacial electronic phenomena and opens new pathways for the design of functional quantum materials through engineered polarization mismatch."

However, since origami consists of flat facets, it is inherently limited in forming smooth curved surfaces upon deployment. This limitation restricts its applicability in systems where smooth curved geometries are essential for performance, such as aerospace systems and electromagnetic communication devices. Herein, we propose an inverse design methodology for thick origami that is capable of flat-folding while forming a smooth curved outer surface upon deployment. By establishing flat-foldable constraints that specify the positions of the creases, our method constructs thick origami capable of flat-folding even with panels that include a curved facet. Furthermore, by representing the origami layout as a graph, we enumerate all possible origami configurations and enable flexible design of the internal structure. Analytical results show that the optimized packaging ratio increases as the number of cells in a layout increases, indicating that the proposed design methodology provides controllability over the packaging ratio through the number of cells. Using our proposed design methodology, we fabricated a deployable origami wing and demonstrated its functionality through successful flight testing, in which the wing was subjected to aerodynamic loads. Our work proposes a new strategy for packaging smooth curved surfaces, addressing the packaging challenges encountered in aerospace and electromagnetic communications and thereby providing greater design freedom."

      "summary": "High overtone bulk acoustic resonators are essential components in microwave signal processing and emerging quantum technologies; however, conventional designs suffer from limited impedance matching, spurious mode interference, and restricted scalability. Here we introduce a laterally excited high overtone thickness shear bulk acoustic resonator, abbreviated as X HTBAR, that overcomes these limitations through a fully planar excitation scheme. The X HTBAR employs a 3 micron thick 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric film on a 500 micron high resistivity silicon substrate, enabling efficient excitation of thickness shear modes through lateral electrodes without the need for bottom electrodes and confining the acoustic field between the top electrodes. This configuration removes parasitic loss channels, increases energy transfer efficiency to greater than ninety nine percent, and provides a stable free spectral range of about 5.75 MHz with very small fluctuations. Experimental measurements show comb like phonon spectra spanning 0.1 to 1.8 GHz, high quality factors in the range of ten to the power of three to ten to the power of five, frequency quality products larger than ten to the power of thirteen at room temperature, and a low temperature coefficient of frequency. In addition, a gridded electrode design together with the intrinsic properties of 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3, including insensitivity to electrode spacing and a large electromechanical coupling coefficient, suppresses spurious modes and allows tunable mode volumes from 0.008 to 0.064 cubic millimeters. These combined features give X HTBAR devices excellent integration compatibility and strong immunity to electrode related perturbations, making them promising multimode phonon sources for large scale quantum interconnects and microwave photonic integrated circuits."

      "summary": "X-ray linear dichroism has been pivotal for probing electronic anisotropies, but its inherent limited spatial resolution precludes atomic-scale investigations of orbital polarization. Here we introduce a versatile electron linear dichroism methodology in scanning transmission electron microscopy that overcomes these constraints. By exploiting momentum-transfer-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy with an atomic-sized probe, we directly visualize orbital occupation at individual atomic columns in real space. Using strained La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films as a model system, we resolve the Mn-3d eg orbital polarization with sub-angstrom precision. We show that compressive strain stabilizes 3z2-r2 occupation while tensile strain favors x2-y2. These results validate our approach against established X-ray measurements while achieving the ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity. We further demonstrate two optimized signal extraction protocols that adapt to experimental constraints without compromising sensitivity. This generalizable platform opens unprecedented opportunities to study symmetry-breaking phenomena at individual defects, interfaces, and in quantum materials where atomic-scale electronic anisotropy governs emergent functionality."

      "summary": "We investigate experimentally the single-particle motion in water of silica colloidal beads half-coated with carbon under the action of a converging laser beam. The beads are self-propelled in this medium by means of self-thermophoresis resulting from local heating as a result of light absorption by their carbon cap. Within a certain laser power range, we find that these particles exhibit a quasi-two-dimensional active motion near a solid surface with stochastic rotational reversals when propelling themselves away from the region of maximum intensity, which leads to a stable trapping with oscillatory-like behavior inside the illuminated region. The orientation autocorrelation function of this type of confined active motion displays damped oscillations whose characteristic frequency increases with increasing propulsion speed, thus resulting in four regimes of translational motion depending on the observation time scale: thermal diffusion, ballistic motion, oscillatory behavior, and confinement. Our experimental findings are well described by a minimal phenomenological model that includes the nonlinear effect of a torque that reorients the particle toward the center of the optical confinement, which in combination with rotational diffusion gives rise to the observed orientational changes that allow their oscillatory trapping inside the light field. We also show that a similar active trapping mechanism emerges in the case of Janus colloidal rods, even though the periodicity is hindered by their three-dimensional rotation in the laser beam."

Despite its importance, the scaling behavior of such cooperativity remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the direct observation of Dicke-type cooperativity arising from the coupled phonons and non-degenerate crystal-field transitions (CFE), namely a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect1, in the rare-earth orthoferrite, ErFeO3. Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we uncover strongly coupled spin, lattice, and orbital excitations. By varying the temperature, we identify the phonon-CFE coupling strength scales as sqrt(N), where N represents the effective ground-state population, which is a hallmark of Dicke cooperativity. Our findings verified the cooperative nature of the interaction between local Jahn-Teller ions and long-range phonons, offering a pathway for tailoring electronic and vibrational properties of materials through population control."

      "summary": "When cooling liquids quickly enough, they bypass crystallization and instead enter a supercooled state and then a glass state. Previous studies have shown that the static structure factors of high-temperature liquids, supercooled liquids, and glasses exhibit only subtle differences, leading to the conclusion that the glass transition cannot be predicted solely from structure factor changes. Our research challenges this view. Specifically, we studied the difficulty of generating configurations corresponding to target structure factors using stochastic gradient descent optimizations. While such optimizations easily converge when targeting the structure factors of higher-temperature liquids, the difficulty significantly increases for lower temperature liquids and glasses. By quantifying this difficulty through the mean squared error achieved, we found a non-differentiable point at the onset temperature of glass dynamics. Our results suggest that the onset of glass dynamics can be explained by a fundamental change in the structure factor's realizability, even though the structure factor itself only changes slightly. Our results are currently based on computer simulations using original and modified Dzugutov interactions, and future work will determine whether our theory is applicable to other glass-forming systems."

Coupled with the {FETMOD} structure generator module, {NEP-FET} can simulate realistic field-effect transistor geometries at sub-micrometer scales containing millions of atoms, and delivers atomistic predictions of temperature fields, per-atom heat flux, and thermal stress in device structures with high fidelity. This framework enables rapid estimation of device-level metrics, including heat-flux density and effective thermal conductivity. Our results reveal pronounced differences in temperature distribution between fin-type and gate-all-around transistor architectures.

However, there is growing awareness that both the structure and electronic ordering that underpin them are not fully homogeneous. Here, we employ scanning three-dimensional X-ray diffraction to spatially resolve structural distortions in La$_{1.675}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_{4}$, a prototypical system that exhibits a strong competition between superconductivity and charge density wave order, across its low-temperature orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition. We uncover two forms of intrinsic microstructural heterogeneity: at 300 K, we reveal remarkably wide tetragonal-like domain wall regions within the nominally orthorhombic crystal structure, and, upon cooling to 100 K, a fine microstructure of orthorhombic-like stripes embedded within the tetragonal matrix emerges. This spatially resolved view directly defines the microstructural architecture of phase coexistence in this system, demonstrating how structural distortions generate intrinsic heterogeneity that shapes the balance between superconductivity and charge density wave order as constrained by the restrictive orthorhombic and tetragonal structures, offering a pathway to control correlated phenomena."

      "summary": "Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities."

      "summary": "We extend non-invertible duality concepts from one-dimensional systems to two spatial dimensions by constructing a web of non-invertible dualities for lattice models with subsystem symmetries. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."

The increased electromechanical coupling in these compounds boosts the performance of high-frequency acoustic devices. So far, progress has largely focused on Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N, which is costly and poorly compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Here, we investigate aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) as a scalable and potentially CMOS-compatible alternative to Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N. Using reactive co-sputtering on both Si and sapphire substrates, we demonstrate wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N thin films ($x \\leq 0.17$) with strong $c$-axis texture and nearly isotropic lattice expansion upon Hf incorporation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates cross-gap hybridization between N 2$p$ and Hf 5$d$ states, which can enhance the Born effective charge and, thereby, the piezoelectric response. Correspondingly, we observe a nearly two-fold enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient, $d_{33}$, relative to AlN, despite increasing structural disorder in Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N. Building on this finding, we demonstrate Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N GHz surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators that exhibit enhanced performance, as well as efficient excitation of bulk acoustic waves with low propagation losses. These results establish Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N as a promising platform for next-generation high-frequency electromechanical devices, with prospects for further piezoelectric enhancements through improved epitaxy."

Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour."

Our findings demonstrate that, although the body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure is thermodynamically stable at equilibrium for small particle sizes, the deposition process induces a crystal-to-crystal phase transition into the more stable wurtzite (WRZ) phase. This transformation is facilitated by a specific redistribution of the nanoparticle ions, which effectively compensates the emerging polar facets at the moment of transition. These insights offer a deeper understanding of oxide nanoparticle formation, which should ultimately help the design of materials with targeted structural features."

While ferroelectric epitaxial thin films have been studied as transferred membranes on flexible substrates, the degree of control over membrane curvature and local polarization remains limited, being tied to spontaneous fold patterns or uniaxial mechanical deformations. To address this challenge, we introduce a versatile, high-precision optical method for engineering the bending and associated polarization landscapes in ferroelectric membranes. Our approach, based on a photosensitive polymer-assisted patterning technique, enables the creation of on-demand bending strain patterns at the micrometer scale. We demonstrate deterministic 90{\\deg} and 180{\\deg} polarization rotations in a ferroelectric BaTiO3 membrane, driven by in-plane strain and flexoelectric effects associated with strain gradients respectively. Such a patterning method is compatible with any oxide membrane, providing a versatile platform for studying strain dependent domain architectures, designing custom ferroelectric landscapes, and investigating flexoelectric behavior with unprecedented control capabilities."

      "summary": "Through a comprehensive free energy analysis, we demonstrate that finite temperature can simultaneously weaken superconductivity and mitigate spin polarization induced depairing, leading to potential non-monotonic temperature-dependent behaviors in superconductors subjected to large exchange fields. Remarkably, superconductivity can be counterintuitively enhanced by temperature when the Zeeman energy exceeds the superconducting order parameter, owing to the competition between thermal and magnetic effects. We propose that multiband effect offers one possible microscopic route for this temperature-induced enhancement and demonstrate it explicitly within a two-band superconducting model. A detailed parameter analysis identifies the conditions under which this phenomenon emerges, suggesting that temperature-enhanced superconductivity may be observable in materials such as MgB2 and FeSe through transport and tunneling measurements."

      "summary": "Recent studies have identified two superconducting domes in FeSe-based superconductors. It was discovered that each dome is accompanied by a distinct nematic quantum critical point (QCP): one associated with a pure nematic QCP, and the other with a nematic QCP entangled with antiferromagnetism (AFM). In this study, we delve into the evolution of the critical current density ($J_{\\rm{c}}$) with doping in FeSe${_{1-x}}$(Te/S)${_{x}}$ single crystals, focusing on the behavior within the two superconducting domes. Surprisingly, three maxima of $J_{\\rm{c}}$ were found in the two superconducting domes, with two sharp peaks in $J_{\\rm{c}}$ observed precisely at the endpoints of the nematic phases, at $x$(Te) $\\sim$ 0.5 for Te-doped and $x$(S) $\\sim$ 0.17 for S-doped FeSe. The mechanisms of vortex pinning and the influence of quantum critical fluctuations have been extensively explored, emphasizing the contribution of quantum critical fluctuations in modulating $J_{\\rm{c}}$. Additionally, an increase in $J_{\\rm{c}}$ was also noted near FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$, where its origin has been explored and discussed. This finding provides crucial clues about the existence of an ordered phase endpoint beneath the superconducting dome, offering an initial basis for further investigation into the potential presence of a QCP beneath it."

      "summary": "Refrigeration based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) can contribute to energysaving, environmentally friendly cooling in private households, or industrial application. The cooling is based on the reversible heat release or uptake during a phase-transformation of the materials that can be controlled by a magnetic field. This process could replace conventional compression-based refrigeration, which often relies on environmentally harmful refrigerants. Here we show, how to digitalize the process chain for the synthesis, theoretical and experimental characterization, and prototypical application of magnetocaloric alloy. Different Heusler alloys are examined experimentally as model systems for potential application in magnetic cooling. OTTR templates are used for the acquisition and semantic representation of knowledge in the development of an ontology. The ontology, when combined with unstructured data, can be exploited to train a model that can then be used to predict missing facts, which can help to gain new insights and to generate new hypotheses. Furthermore, tools are developed that automate data acquisition into ontological structures and workflows are implemented that provide an easy-to-use theoretical and experimental evaluation of the MCE from first principles and raw data."

A series of narrow bridges with varying widths at the same location of a single crystal were prepared by the \\textquotedblleft pickup\\textquotedblright method using successive focused ion beam millings. By simply reducing the width of bridge, the magnitude of critical current density ($J_{\\rm{c}}$) is enhanced more than one order, evidence the achievement of depairing limit. Moreover, in the bridge with a width smaller than the penetration depth ($\\lambda$), $J_{\\rm{c}}$ is found to be robust against magnetic field up to 1 kOe. The field-robust $J_{\\rm{c}}$ is a strong piece of evidence for vortex-free state, which is created by the enhancement of lower critical fields due to geometric constraint."

Analysis based on the Dew-Hughes model of the $f_{\\text{p}}$(h) relationship shows that strain strengthens vortex pinning, and shifts the pinning mechanism from point-like pinning to combined point and surface pinnings. This work offers an effective method to enhance FeSe's current-carrying limitation, deepens understanding of iron-based superconductors' pinning mechanisms, and highlights strain engineering's potential for optimizing superconducting performance."

Density functional theory calculations for bulk Co$_3$O$_4$ show that introducing an oxygen vacancy reduces two adjacent Co$^{3+}$ ions to Co$^{2+}$ and narrows the band gap. The newly formed Co$^{2+}$ ions adopt high-spin configurations in distorted octahedral sites and remain stable in this state in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at $300$ K. Computed O and Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for ideal and vacancy-containing Co$_3$O$_4$ show excellent agreement with the experimental data and serve as references to analyze the liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation. The comparison with experimental O K-edge spectra of fresh and post-reaction catalysts shows that fresh samples resemble the vacancy-containing reference, whereas post-reaction spectra shift toward the ideal reference. These results suggest that under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation conditions, Co$_3$O$_4$ becomes more oxidized rather than reduced, by refilling preexisting oxygen vacancies. This is further supported by the observation that higher O$_2$ pressures increase the conversion and that the catalyst remains stable and active over several cycles."

This limitation is acute in laser-based ARPES, where the low photon energy restricts momentum space despite ultrahigh resolution. Here we present systematic studies of bias ARPES, where applying a sample bias expands the accessible momentum range and enables full 2$\\pi$ solid angle collection in two dimension using our 6.994 eV laser source. An analytical conversion relation is established and validated to accurately map the detector angle to the emission angle and the electron momentum in two dimensions. A precise approach is developed to determine the sample work function which is critical in the angle-momentum conversion of the bias ARPES experiments. Energy and angular resolutions are preserved under biases up to 100 V, and minimizing beam size is shown to be crucial. The technique is effective both near normal and off-normal geometries, allowing flexible Brillouin zone access with lower biases. Bias ARPES thus elevates laser ARPES to a new level, extending momentum coverage while retaining high resolution, and is applicable across a broad photon-energy range."

However, ultrafast exciton decay and quenched photoluminescence (PL) limit their potential. Combining femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with first-principles calculations on MoS2 and WS2 nanoplatelets, we reveal that the observed sub-picosecond exciton decay originates from edge-located optically bright hole traps. These intrinsic trap states stem from the metal d-orbitals and persist even when the sulfur-terminated edges are hydrogen-passivated. Notably, WS2 nanostructures show more localized and optically active edge states than their MoS2 counterparts, and zigzag edges exhibit a higher trap density than armchair edges. The nanoplatelet size dictates the competition between ultrafast edge-trapping and slower core-exciton recombina- tion, and the states responsible for exciton quenching enhance catalytic activity. Our work represents an important step forward in understanding exciton quenching in TMD nanoplatelets and stimulates additional research to refine physicochemical protocols for enhanced PL."

To reach our goal, we carried out steady-state Monte Carlo (MC) simulations over $4\\times 10^5$ points, for both lattices, in order to obtain a framework of the steady reactive state of the model for different values of the nitric oxide dissociation rate, $r_{NO}$. The results show the emergence of steady reactive state for certain values of $r_{NO}$ and of exchange diffusion rate $x$ when the simulations take place on square lattices. Our findings on the hexagonal lattice also show that the diffusion of these species favors the appearance of the active phase for values of $r_{NO}$ lower than that found for the standard model. In addition, we observed that the system possesses a continuous phase transition and a discontinuous one separating the active phase from absorbing states for both lattices, except for $r_{NO}=1$ in which the continuous phase transition is destroyed and a steady reactive state emerges from the beginning since very small values of $x$."

Optical characterization, including steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, reveals a systematic blueshift in emission energy with increasing FABr content, attributed to the passivation of bromine vacancies and to the reduction of defect-assisted recombination. Power-dependent PL confirms this interpretation: the stoichiometric film exhibits a PL band due to donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as identified by the typical excitation-dependent blueshift, whereas FABr-enriched samples show no evidence of DAP emission, indicating effective defect passivation. Additionally, morphological characterization shows a reduction in grain size with increasing FABr excess, indicating a trade-off between improved electronic quality and enhanced structural disorder. The film synthesized with a 5% excess of FABr provides the optimal balance, yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (6.26%), average visible transmittance (61.6%), and light utilization efficiency (3.85%). These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the precursor stoichiometry through controlled FABr addition represents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the optoelectronic quality and performance of semitransparent perovskite solar cells."

Here, we investigate a new approach that uses Rydberg impurities as a spectroscopic sensor of the surrounding strongly correlated state of ultracold paired fermions. The extended wavefunction of the Rydberg electron induces a finite-range potential that can bind atoms from the BCS medium, forming molecular states. As a consequence, the optical absorption spectrum of the impurity encodes key many-body properties. Using the functional determinant approach, we provide a direct measure of the superfluid gap through frequency shifts of dimer and trimer peaks. The spectra also reveal whether the Cooper pairs are broken or trapped intact. For static Rydberg atoms, we relate this signature of pairing to the suppression of the orthogonality catastrophe due to the superconducting gap resulting in the formation of well-defined polaron quasiparticles. Our work establishes Rydberg atom spectroscopy as a powerful local probe of strongly correlated matter."

A properly chosen dose suppresses superconductivity down to $4\\,\\mathrm{K}$, while crystallinity is still preserved. With this approach we create areas of normal-conducting YBCO that can be used to define resistively shunted constriction-type Josephson junctions (cJJs) on the nanometer scale. We also demonstrate that the fabricated cJJs can be incorporated in direct current superconducting quantum interference devices and can be used as detector junctions in THz antennas."

      "summary": "Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians."

Recently, we introduced a hybrid method, QM-GF, that enables an accurate description of both interfacial chemistry and phononic dissipation in semi-infinite bulks. In this work, we apply this simulation scheme to study the dependence of kinetic friction on sliding velocity. Using a prototypical diamond interface with varying hydrogen coverages, we find that the friction force decreases with increasing sliding velocity, revealing two distinct sliding regimes at low and high speeds. We provide a physical interpretation of this velocity dependence based on the modulation of the frictional force by the sliding motion over the periodic potential energy surface of the interface. High velocities lead to force cancellation, while low velocities result in a net frictional force characterized by a distinctive sawtooth profile."

Such materials are typically modeled using computationally expensive ab initio methods, but these approaches are greatly limited to small sample sizes. Here, we develop a highly efficient hard-particle packing algorithm to model large samples of these layered complex alloys that enables an accurate determination of the geometrical and topological properties of the B-site arrangements within the plane of the inorganic layers across length scales. Our results are in good agreement with various experiments, and therefore our algorithm bypasses the need for full-blown ab initio calculations. The accurate predictive power of our algorithm demonstrates how our minimalist hard-particle model effectively captures complex interactions and dynamics like incoherent thermal motion, out of plane octahedral tilting, and bond compression/stretching. We specifically show that the composition-dependent miscibility predicted by our algorithm for certain silver-iron and copper-indium layered alloys are consistent with previous experimental observations. We further quantify the degree of mixing in the simulated structures across length scales using our recently developed sensitive \"mixing\" metric. The large structural snapshots provided by our algorithm also shed light on previous experimentally measured magnetic properties of a copper-indium system. The generalization of our algorithm to model 3D perovskite alloys is also discussed. In summary, our packing model and mixing metric enable one to accurately explore the enormous space of hypothetical layered mosaic alloy compositions and identify materials with potentially desirable optoelectronic and magnetic properties."

This distinction originates from the path traced by its rotation matrices within the doubly connected SO(3) group manifold, leading to a nontrivial spinor phase of $e^{i\\pi}$ upon encircling the texture. Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions. While conventional skyrmions exhibit a dominant $\\sigma_z$ component with weak dipolar $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y$ contributions, spin-flux skyrmions possess an additional monopolar $\\sigma_x$ component that yields a finite average emergent field for a finite density of skyrmions. This nontrivial component introduces a nontrivial term in the Hall conductivity, enabling a direct explanation of experimental Hall resistivity anomalies that cannot be accounted for by conventional skyrmions alone. Moreover, we show that this additional term couples to the in-plane spin polarization of conduction electrons, providing a further tunable handle to control the transverse Hall response."

While neutral two-particle excitations (excitons) have been observed in tr-ARPES, signatures of trions -- three-quasiparticle bound states -- have only been probed via optical spectroscopy. Here, we develop a generic theory for the ARPES signature of trions in the model system of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). We simulate the ARPES signals of both positively and negatively charged trions and show that the interaction of the residual holes, or electron and hole, lead to large energy shifts, on the order of the exciton binding energy, compared to the exciton signal. For positive trions, the additional momentum degree of freedom of the residual particles removes any strict lower bound on the photoemission energy, leading to distinctive asymmetric spectral features. For negative trions, the photoemission process causes the tr-ARPES spectrum to reproduce inverted images of the exciton band structure for multiple exciton states, encompassing both spin-allowed and spin-forbidden states, providing a direct momentum-resolved probe of both trion and exciton physics."

In essence, this constraint requires each of the $K$-mers in use to be as lengthy as possible, given its surroundings in the resulting tiling. Maximality aims to limit the variety of possible tilings while allowing for interesting behavior in terms of the statistical physical observables of interest. In fact, by introducing an energy function based on cell contacts and parameterizing it appropriately, we have been able to observe relatively unexpected behavior, including the suggestion of phase transitions as the system's temperature evolves."

      "summary": "Coherent crystalline interfaces form when a pair of joined crystals share lattice sites. Such interfaces are ubiquitous in materials, minerals, and compounds, with examples including grain boundaries in polycrystals and phase boundaries in multi-phase systems. Existing methodologies such as the topological model provide a framework for understanding the nature of coherency between two crystals and the line defect content within an interface. However, these methods only consider states of coherency achieved via affine transformations. Here we show that in some interfaces, local relaxations in the form of non-affine transformations lead to the introduction of additional coincidence sites within the interface; we term this class of interfaces as e-coherent. These non-affine relaxations are topologically equivalent to inserting disconnection (or disclination) dipoles or loops into the interface. Unlike traditional interfacial line defects, the defects associated with e-coherency cannot have long-range stress fields and their motion alters the state of coherency between the crystals. Given these unique properties, we differentiate them from other defects by referring to them as discohesions. Through atomistic simulations and transmission electron microscopy, we show that the energetics and kinetics of e-coherent interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content in the interface, leading to fundamentally different behaviors compared to non-e-coherent interfaces. We demonstrate e-coherency in grain, twin, and phase boundaries, and that a given interface can have multiple possible e-coherent states. These results suggest that e-coherency is likely to be pervasive in crystalline solids."

      "summary": "Characterizing topological phases for strongly interacting fermions in the mixed-state regime remains a major challenge. Here we introduce a general and numerically efficient framework to diagnose mixed-state topological phases in strongly interacting systems via the disorder parameter (DP) of the U(1) charge operator. Specifically, from the finite-size scaling of the second derivative of the DP generating function, we introduce the topological scaling indicator, which exhibits a characteristic linear scaling with the system's linear dimension for topological phases, a signature that vanishes upon transition into a topologically trivial phase. Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures. This work provides a powerful and accessible tool for the numerical exploration of topological phenomena in interacting mixed states, opening a pathway to study systems previously inaccessible due to computational obstacles."

However, the integration of computational predictions with experimental validation remains challenging in high-throughput studies. In this work, we introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental evidence. The experimental dataset was generated via high-throughput in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction on compositionally varied FeNiMnCr alloy libraries, heated from room temperature to ~1000 {\\deg}C. Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-dependent probability of phase formation.

In experiments of contact between polymethylmethacrylate blocks under decreasing normal loads, Dillavou and Rubinstein have shown that the true contact area exhibits, after unloading, a decreasing phase and long-term memory of the contact state prior to unloading. It is however unclear what modeling ingredients are necessary to reproduce these two features. Here, we investigate these effects using fractional viscoelastic rough contact models. By adapting existing contact theories and numerical simulation methods to fractional viscoelasticity, which induces a wide relaxation spectrum, we reproduce logarithmic aging under constant load, but show that memory of the contact state is erased upon unloading. Indeed, the contact area behaves as if it had always experienced the reduced load, even on short time-scales, contrasting with the response of a standard linear solid. Moreover, none of our results show a decreasing regime of the contact area after unload: we ultimately prove that this is the case for all linear viscoelastic models -- despite capturing logarithmic aging -- leading to the conclusion that additional local internal variables are required to explain both long-term contact memory and contact area reduction after unloading."

The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors.

      "summary": "Digital computers are power-hungry and largely intolerant of damaged components, making them potentially difficult tools for energy-limited autonomous agents in uncertain environments. Recently developed Contrastive Local Learning Networks (CLLNs) - analog networks of self-adjusting nonlinear resistors - are inherently low-power and robust to physical damage, but were constructed to perform supervised learning. In this work we demonstrate success on two simple RL problems using Q-learning adapted for simulated CLLNs. Doing so makes explicit the components (beyond the network being trained) required to enact various tools in the RL toolbox, some of which (policy function and value function) are more natural in this system than others (replay buffer). We discuss assumptions such as the physical safety that digital hardware requires, CLLNs can forgo, and biological systems cannot rely on, and highlight secondary goals that are important in biology and trainable in CLLNs, but make little sense in digital computers."

Typical approaches to deriving optimal, error-minimizing, non-equilibrium driving protocols for estimating these landscapes require a priori knowledge of the landscape. Here, we present an alternative: an iterative algorithm for optimizing full free energy landscape reconstructions which can be used alongside experiments on unknown landscapes. Our approach (i) takes experimental or simulated trajectory data; (ii) reconstructs an `approximate' energy landscape; (iii) derives optimal control protocols from low-dimensional differentiable Brownian dynamics simulations on the candidate landscape using automatic differentiation; (iv) re-runs the experiment or simulation using the updated protocol; and (v) iterates until convergence. Using this approach, we recover known benchmarks from the literature and probe far-from-equilibrium regimes for symmetric, asymmetric, and triple-well energy landscapes under both 1- and 2-dimensional control. Our control protocols -- derived with no a priori knowledge of the energy landscape -- yield substantially reduced variance and bias in free energy landscape reconstructions compared to naive linear protocols."

Spin chains, in particular, exhibit unique {charging} properties across diverse settings. Here, we introduce the kicked-Ising model as a QB and analytically characterize its charging dynamics within the self-dual operator regime, valid for arbitrary system sizes and Floquet cycles. Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms."

      "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a promising machine learning method for microstructure simulations such as grain growth. However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method. Our findings provide a highly scalable approach for simulating grain growth."

Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials."

Optical velocimetry and multi-channel pyrometry were used to obtain Hugoniot data, isentropic release paths, and interface temperature histories. The results validate a modified two-phase equation of state (EOS) for copper based on the framework of Greeff et al. The measured Hugoniot shows good agreement with the present model but exhibits significant softening above ~156 GPa relative to the original Greeff EOS, indicating that reduction in lattice specific heat becomes essential when shock temperatures exceed three times the melting point (T > 3Tm). Unloading behavior matches hydrodynamic simulations incorporating the recalibrated EOS, confirming its accuracy for off-Hugoniot states. Theoretical analysis of temperature release profiles suggests that the thermal conductivity of shocked copper powders may be considerably higher than first-principles predictions. Crucially, despite heterogeneity in shock heating, the macroscopic dynamic response of copper powders with a porosity of ~1.7 is well captured by an average-density EOS model, supporting the use of porous material experiments for EOS validation under extreme conditions."

A central challenge in this field is identifying an optimal platform to enable compact, efficient, and scalable reconfigurability. Optical phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a compelling solution by enabling non-volatile, reversible tuning of optical properties, compatible with a wide range of device platforms and current CMOS technologies. In particular, antimony tri-selenide ($\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$) stands out for its ultra low-loss characteristics at telecommunication wavelengths and its reversible switching. In this work, we present an experimental platform capable of encoding multi-port operations onto the transmission matrix of a compact multimode interferometer architecture on standard 220~nm silicon photonics using \\textit{in-silico} designed digital patterns. The multi-port devices are clad with a thin film of $\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$, which can be optically addressed using direct laser writing to provide local perturbations to the refractive index. A range of multi-port geometries from 2$\\times$2 up to 5$\\times$5 couplers are demonstrated, achieving simultaneous control of up to 25 matrix elements with programming accuracy of 90% relative to simulated patterns. Patterned devices remain stable with consistent optical performance across the C-band wavelengths. Our work establishes a pathway towards the development of large scale PCM-based reconfigurable multi-port devices which will allow implementing matrix operations on three orders of magnitude smaller areas than interferometer meshes."

We first analyze a driven two-photon emission process and show how doublon BICs arise and mediate decoherence-free interaction between distant atoms. We then demonstrate that these many-body BICs also emerge under natural, undriven dynamics via a virtual two-photon emission process in three-level giant atoms. Our results reveal an interference-based mechanism for stabilizing many-body localization in open quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum simulation, non-ergodic dynamics, and protected quantum information processing."

From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation."

It has been suggested in the nanocomposite literature that nanotube curvature, in conjunction with surface functionalization such as polydopamine (PDA) coating, could serve as an additional control knob for tuning interfacial bonding and energy dissipation in polymer-CNT systems. While experimental and simulation studies have demonstrated the benefits of PDA functionalization, the fundamental mechanism by which nanotube curvature modulates interfacial energy flow and mechanical polarity remains unresolved. This gap is sharpened by a persistent paradox: identical PDA functionalization strengthens some CNT-polymer systems while weakening others, a curvature-dependent inconsistency that has remained unexplained. Here, we employ reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF) simulations to resolve how curvature and PDA functionalization jointly govern interfacial energy evolution in CNT-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites. Our investigation reveals that curvature and PDA functionalization jointly produce opposite regimes of interfacial energy flow: high-curvature CNTs generate dissipative, frictional interphases, whereas low-curvature CNTs confine energy in rigid, cohesive shells. This polarity inversion originates from a curvature-induced transition in PDA adsorption geometry that transforms the interphase from an energy-releasing to an energy-storing configuration. These results establish curvature as a fundamental design parameter for engineering polymer-nanotube interfaces, offering a predictive route to tune interfacial energy flow, mechanical resilience, and transport properties beyond the limits of conventional chemical functionalization."

We propose a novel framework to model equity and mortgage dynamics in presence of mortgage interest rates, borrowing costs on equity-backed credit lines, and tax shields arising from interest deductibility. The model is calibrated on three jurisdictions -- Australia, Germany, and Switzerland -- representing diverse interest rate environments and fiscal regimes. Results demonstrate that introducing positive interest rates without tax shields contracts success regions and lengthens repayment times, while tax shields partially reverse these effects by reducing effective borrowing costs and adding equity boosts from mortgage interest deductibility.

      "summary": "Radiation of a charged particle crossing an alternating stack of slabs in the optical region is considered. Both disordered and periodic stacks are investigated. It is shown that for special type of alternating disordered and periodic stacks the radiation problem can be solved exactly for backward and forward Brewster observation angles. Strong $N^2$ dependence of radiation intensity on slab number is re-established in special case of the disordered stack. This leads to strong directivity either on forward or on backward Brewster angles depending on the type of stack randomness. In certain type of periodic photonic crystal, a strong energy dependence $E^4$ for relativistic particles of the radiation intensity, observed at Brewster's angle is found. Further increment of particle energy leads to saturation. The band structure of the corresponding photonic crystal (PhC) has a behavior, analogous to the Dirac cones in graphene. We suggest this special type $1D$ photonic crystal for application as a detector of relativistic particles."

At the gap, the instrumental resolution skews the signal, producing a high-energy tail that complicates fitting. Our function assumes an instrumental $Q$-resolution with two equal wide and one narrow direction (typical of focused TAS instruments), and a parabolic dispersion at the gap, which is exact for quadratic and accurate for linear dispersions if the resolution is moderate. We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements. The function is simple to implement, converges reliably, and we recommend its use for future gap fitting on TAS data."

We show that combining this flux-induced localization with engineered dissipation leads to robust spin synchronization in rotationally symmetric spin geometries, referred to as Aharonov-Bohm motifs, with cyclic symmetries of any order. The synchronized dynamics is independent of initial conditions and features entanglement among spins within each motif. We further demonstrate that multiple motifs can fully synchronize when coupled, which is achieved by applying additional collective dissipation acting on all intra-motif spins. These results reveal a direct connection between flux-induced localization, dissipative engineering, and collective quantum synchronization."

Although significant in nearly all such experiments, material dispersion is commonly neglected in theoretical studies. Yet, as we show here, understanding the precise microscopic model for the material dispersion is crucial for predicting experimental outcomes. Here we study the temporal scattering coefficients of four different time-varying Drude-Lorentz models, exploring how an incident continuous wave splits into forward and backward waves due to an abrupt change in plasma frequency. The differences in the predicted scattering are unique to time-varying media, and arise from the exact way in which the time variation appears in the various model parameters. We verify our results using a custom finite difference time domain algorithm, concluding with a discussion of the limitations that arise from using these models with an abrupt change in plasma frequency."

By leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose and domain-specific models, TRECI enables stable and accurate simulations across a wide potential range using a reduced number of reference configurations. This efficiency allows the use of high-level meta-GGA functionals and rigorous surface-electrification schemes. Applied to Cu(111)/water, models trained on just one thousand configurations yield accurate molecular dynamics simulations, capturing bias-dependent solvent restructuring effects not previously reported. TRECI offers a general strategy for characterising diverse materials and interfacial chemistries, significantly lowering the cost of realistic constant-potential simulations and expanding access to quantitative electrochemical modelling."

In this work, we employ a comprehensive toolbox of state-of-the-art numerical approaches to classically simulate the dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our methods include three different tensor network techniques -- matrix product states, tree-tensor networks, and two-dimensional tensor-networks under the belief propagation approximation -- as well as time-dependent variational Monte Carlo with Neural Quantum States. We focus on two paradigmatic dynamical protocols: (i) quantum annealing through a critical point and (ii) post-quench dynamics. Our extensive results show the quantitative predictions of various state-of-the-art numerical methods providing a benchmark for future numerical investigations and experimental studies with the aim to push the limitations on classical and QPUs. In particular, our work connects classical simulability to different regimes associated with quantum dynamics in Rydberg arrays - namely, quasi-adiabatic dynamics, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and quantum quenches."

Specifically, we show that the response to perturbations coupled to the particle number within a finite region exhibits the same size scaling as the entanglement entropy of that region. We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume. Our work thus establishes a direct link between linear-response properties and many-body entanglement."

As a proof of concept, we deploy this system for the resist development of Josephson junction devices. A statistical comparison of the process repeatability shows the robotic process achieves a resistance spread across chips close to 2%, a significant improvement over the ~7% spread observed from human operators, validating robotics as a solution to eliminate operator-dependent variability and a path towards industrial-level consistency in a research setting."

The SR phenomenon involves the detection of weak signals by adding an optimal amount noise to a non-linear system. This is linked with Kramers' escape problem, which deals with the escape of a particle undergoing Brownian motion over an energy barrier. The position of the particle is analogous to the polarisation dynamics of a ferroelectric. Within this framework, we numerically investigate SR in single domain ferroelectrics using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory. In addition, we use a model for multidomain ferroelectrics to demonstrate feasibility in real world applications. Our results show that SR in ferroelectrics is promising for the purpose of weak signal detection, given that these materials are widely used for various applications in the semiconductor industry."

We then apply VCA to compute the stability of different surfaces using an extended version of the surface formation energy Omega. Our calculations show, on one hand, a working VCA implementation with its flaws (overestimation of Etot) and strengths (well modelling of DOS). On other hand, a further result is that bulk of the slab of a mixed-crystal has a minor influence on the configuration of the surface."

For highly flexible polymers, a relatively large number of monomers ($N_c\\sim500$) undergo correlated motion at the glass transition temperature $T_g$, independent of molecular weight ($M$). In contrast, less flexible polymers show a complex $N_c(M)$ behaviour divided into three regimes, consistent with observation in both $T_g(M)$ and chain conformational structure. For short oligomers ($\\lesssim$ 2 Kuhn steps), a transition from mainly $\\it{inter}$molecular correlations and $N_c\\sim 200$, to strongly $\\it{intra}$molecular correlations and $N_c< 50$ (roughly the molecular size) is observed; for longer chains, $N_c$ increases weakly, before saturating. For poly(methyl methacrylate), a remarkable similarity is found between $N_c(M)$ and the $M$-dependent ratio of the activation barriers of the structural ($\\alpha$) and secondary ($\\beta$) relaxations.

Despite extensive studies, direct evidence of FBs tuned to the chemical potential and their role in emergent orders in bulk materials remains lacking. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and density functional theory, we show that the low-energy structure of the Cr-based kagome metal superconductor {\\Cr} is dominated by FBs at the Fermi level. We also observe low-energy magnetic excitations evolving across the low-temperature transition, largely consistent with the FB shift. Our results suggest that the low-temperature order contains a magnetic origin and that the kagome FBs may play a role in the emergence of this order."

      "summary": "Crystal structures can be simplified as a periodic point set that repeats across three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, crystal representation methods characterize the structure using descriptors such as lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups. However, in reality, atoms in materials always vibrate above absolute zero, causing their positions to fluctuate continuously. This dynamic behavior disrupts the fundamental periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under slight perturbations. Chemists proposed the pairwise distance distribution (PDD) method to address this problem. However, the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, PDD does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to apply it directly to crystal material property prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) and apply them to the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. We demonstrate the continuity and general completeness of crystal graphs under slight atomic position perturbations. Moreover, by modeling PDD as global information and integrating it into matrix-based message passing, we significantly reduce computational costs. Comprehensive evaluation results show that WPDDFormer achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across tasks on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT."

We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines."

For non-interacting cases, symmetry-eigenvalue analysis of Bloch states at high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone simplifies the calculation of topological quantities. However, when open boundaries are present, and only the point group part of the symmetry group remains, it is unclear how to utilize crystalline symmetries to diagnose band topology. In this work, we introduce topological crystalline markers to characterize bulk topology in $C_n$-symmetric ($n=2,3,4,6$) crystalline insulators and superconductors with and without translation symmetry. These markers are expressed using a crystalline symmetry operator and the ground state projector, and are defined locally in position space. First, we provide a general method to calculate topological markers in periodic systems with an arbitrary number of unit cells. This includes cases where momentum quantization does not span all necessary high-symmetry points for computing the topological quantities, which we address using twisted boundary conditions. Second, we map these markers to the Chern number, bulk polarization, and sector charge for two-dimensional $C_n$-symmetric insulators in symmetry classes A, AI, AII, and superconductors in class D. Finally, we show how to numerically calculate the markers in finite-size systems with translation-symmetry (and even rotation-symmetry) breaking defects, and how to diagnose the bulk topology from the marker. Our results demonstrate how to compute bulk topological crystalline invariants locally in position space, thereby providing broader scope to diagnosing bulk crystalline topology that works even in inhomogeneous systems where there is no global rotation symmetry."

Here, we demonstrate a technique for measuring the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator.

      "summary": "A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete 4x4 block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Fully correlated static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. A special focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem while keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex, as well as the components of the dynamical kernel, acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes."

Third component plays the role of a surfactant, which can wet the interface formed by components 1 and 2. The case of symmetry of components 1 and 2, the equation for nucleation line and wetting phase diagram are studied. By linearizing the set of three-coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, the wave functions of the components are found.

      "summary": "Superconductivity in flatband systems has attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter physics. Alternating twisted multilayer graphene presents a compelling multiband system, with a coexistence of Dirac bands and flat bands, for exploring superconductivity. However, the roles of flat bands and dispersive bands played in determining the superconductivity remain elusive. Here, we focus on the alternating twisted quadralayer graphene to reveal unconventional superconducting behaviors by systematically quantifying individual contributions for both the dispersive bands and the flat bands. The superconductivity is robust, with a strong electrical field tunability, a maximum BKT transition temperature of 1.6 K, and high critical magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. By analyzing the Landau fan diagram at zero electric displacement fields, we disentangle Dirac bands and flat bands, revealing a Coulomb interaction-induced band broadening effect. We further quantify the electric-field-dependent evolution of the critical temperature and coherence length, and estimate the flat-band Fermi velocity and superfluid stiffness via critical current measurements. Our results demonstrate an electric field tunable coupling strength within the superconducting phase, revealing unconventional properties with vanishing Fermi velocity and large superfluid stiffness. These phenomena, attributed to substantial quantum metric contributions mediated by Dirac band hybridization, offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying unconventional flatband superconductivity in moir\\'e systems."

Typical examples include contraction waves in acto-myosin cortex at cellular scale and peristaltic waves at tissue level. In such systems, chemical activity is transformed into mechanical deformation by distributed motor-type mechanisms represented by continuum degrees of freedom. To elucidate the underlying principles of chemo-mechanical coupling, we here present the simplest example, involving directional motion of a localized solitary wave in a distributed mechanical system, guided by a purely chemical cue. Our main result is that mechanical signals can be driven by chemical activity in a highly efficient manner."

We propose a novel method for estimating the mean entropy production rate $\\sigma$ that relies solely on position traces, bypassing the need for flux or microscopic force measurements. Starting from a recently introduced variance sum rule, we express $\\sigma$ in terms of measurable steady-state correlation functions which we link to previously studied kinetic quantities, known as traffic and inflow rate. Under realistic constraints of limited access to dynamical degrees of freedom, we derive efficient bounds on $\\sigma$ by leveraging the information contained in the system's traffic, enabling partial but meaningful estimates of $\\sigma$. We benchmark our results across several orders of magnitude in $\\sigma$ using two models: a linear stochastic system and a nonlinear model for spontaneous hair-bundle oscillations. Our approach offers a practical and versatile framework for investigating entropy production in nonequilibrium systems."

      "summary": "Coherent manipulation of plasmon wavepackets in solid-state systems is crucial for advancing nanoscale electronic devices, offering a unique platform for quantum information processing based on propagating quantum bits. Controlling the eigenstate of plasmon wavepackets is essential, as it determines its propagation speed and hence the number of quantum operations that can be performed during its flight-time through a quantum system. When plasmon wavepackets are generated by short voltage pulses and transmitted through nanoscale devices, they distribute among multiple electron conduction channels via Coulomb interactions, a phenomenon known as charge fractionalisation. This spreading complicates plasmon manipulation in quantum circuits and makes precise control of the eigenstates of plasmon wavepackets challenging. Using a cavity, we demonstrate the ability to isolate and select electron conduction channels contributing to plasmon excitation, thus enabling precise control of plasmon eigenstate. Specifically, we observe an electron-channel blockade effect, where charge fractionalisation into cavity-confined channels is suppressed due to the plasmon's narrow energy distribution, enabling more stable and predictable plasmonic circuits. This technique provides a versatile tool for designing plasmonic circuits, offering the ability to tailor plasmon speed through local parameters, minimise unwanted plasmon excitation in adjacent circuits, and enable the precise selection of electron-channel plasmon eigenstates in quantum interferometers."

      "summary": "The rising computational demand of modern workloads has renewed interest in energy-efficient paradigms such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A fundamental operation in these systems is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Here, we demonstrate MVM using inverse-designed metastructures that exploit heat conduction as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures, while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals. The metastructures are obtained via density-based topology optimization, enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic differentiation, achieving an accuracy $> 99\\%$ in most cases across pool of matrices with dimensions $2 \\times 2$ and $3 \\times 3$. We apply this methodology--termed thermal analog computing--to realize matrices relevant to practical tasks, including the discrete Fourier transform and convolutional filters. These results suggest new opportunities for analog information processing in environments where temperature gradients naturally arise, such as device hotspots and thermal controllers"

The obtained phase transformations at 0 K agree well with the experiments at low temperatures. The hydrogen solubility limits in the low-concentration $\\alpha$ phases at 0 K are predicted to be $x = 1.0$ and $x = 1.5$ for the C15 and the C14 phases, respectively. At these concentrations, C15 TiCr$_2$H shows the $Cc$ monoclinic symmetry, while C14 TiCr$_2$H$_{1.5}$ shows the $Ama2$ orthorhombic symmetry, both of which have not been reported for this system. The first and the second hydride phases, i.e., $\\beta$ and $\\beta'$, at 0 K are found around $x = 3$ and $x = 4$, respectively, for both the C15 and the C14 phases.

Furthermore, the $6h_2$ A$_2$B$_2$ interstices are found to be energetically substantially more preferable for C14 TiCr$_2$H$_x$ than the other A$_2$B$_2$ interstices at low hydrogen concentrations, influencing the hydrogen-occupation trend."

In the present work, we report an exhaustive density functional investigation on structural, electronic and magnetic properties of MnC, using different levels of exchange-correlation approximations. We show that SCAN meta-GGA and PBE0r hybrid functional outperform GGA-PBEsol, HSE06 hybrid functional and the mean field DFT+$U$+$V$; in predicting correctly the experimental zincblende structure as the groundstate one. It is demonstrated that the bond exchange plays a crucial role in this stabilization. At theoretical equilibrium, hybrid functionals (PBE0r and HSE06) lead to a metallic behavior of MnC. Semilocal ones (PBEsol and SCAN) and mean field DFT+$U$+$V$, however, predict two opposite kinds of half-metallic ferromagnetism; opening a debate on the origin and the nature this behavior. If the latter is confirmed experimentally, MnC could be for importance as a spintronic material."

We investigate theoretically the behavior of Rydberg indirect excitons in Xenes-hBN-TMDC, Xenes-hBN-BP, and Xenes-hBN-TMTC heterostructures, subject to parallel external electric and magnetic fields that are oriented perpendicular to the layers. By incorporating both isotropic and anisotropic materials, we demonstrate that excitonic properties can be effectively tuned through the external field strengths and the heterostructure design. Our results show that the exciton reduced mass and the binding energy increase with the electric field strength, while enhanced dielectric screening from additional hBN layers reduces the binding energy. Anisotropic materials exhibit distinct excitonic responses, including variations in diamagnetic behavior. Moreover, the diamagnetic energy contributions and coefficients decrease with stronger electric fields but increase with the number of hBN layers. Finally, we explore the potential of time-periodic electric fields with Floquet band-structure engineering. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for controlling excitonic phenomena in low-dimensional materials, enabling the design of advanced optoelectronic and quantum devices."

Yet, their effect on mass transfer in these multiphase systems remains ambiguous, with some experiments reporting strongly hindered diffusion, while others show nearly no effect, even at near-complete surface coverage. To resolve this ambiguity, we solve the Fick-Jacobs equation for unsteady diffusion, allowing us to treat the particle-laden interface as a locally reduced cross-sectional area for mass transfer. Our numerical solutions reveal two limiting regimes, with the particle layer hindering diffusion only at short times. Guided by analytical solutions for a homogeneous layer with reduced diffusivity, we derive quantitative expressions for the transport regimes and associated transition times for diffusion across the particle layer. This analysis yields a simple criterion for long-term hindrance that accurately distinguishes between conflicting experimental results, providing a unifying framework for mass transfer in particle-laden multiphase systems."

      "summary": "Metal hydrides are promising solid-state carriers for the integrated hydrogen economy, which is essential for achieving carbon neutrality. However, their conventional synthesis relies on external sources of high-purity H2, thereby linking storage directly to energy-intensive production processes. Here, we transform this paradigm by introducing an acid-mediated \"controllable hydrogen embrittlement\" strategy for the direct and efficient synthesis and functionalization of metal hydrides under mild conditions. This approach leverages in situ hydrogen generation and defect engineering during the reaction of bulk metals with acid, enabling the preparation of over 20 high-purity hydrides. Using diamond anvil cell experiments, we establish a quantitative criterion, |Delta Peq| > Delta Pph, which reveals the key mechanism governing hydride formation and stability, and guides the synthesis of challenging targets such as LiH. This method not only significantly lowers the energy footprint and economic cost of hydride synthesis by eliminating the need for high-pressure H2 and enabling the use of renewable feedstocks but also creates defect-rich, active hydrides. As a demonstration, an engineered titanium hydride achieves an outstanding current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for NH3 in the nitrate electroreduction reaction, while maintaining consistently high performance across a wide operating window, showcasing the stability conferred by enhanced H- transport. This work redefines hydrogen embrittlement as a powerful tool for synthesis and functionalization, establishing a material platform that integrates hydrogen capture, storage, and conversion, and thereby opening a novel pathway to unify the fragmented hydrogen energy chain."

In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer and tri-layer of WSe$_2$ are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials."

While its efficacy has been demonstrated in the homogeneous systems theoretically, most experimental setups feature a confining potential, such as a harmonic trap, which complicates the practical implementations. In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the nearest-neighbor tunneling excitations under harmonic confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger amplitude yields the clearest spectrum. Our work offers pivotal insights into conducting quench spectroscopy effectively in practical systems."

      "summary": "Spins of carriers confined in quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for qubits due to their relatively long spin relaxation times. However, the electron spin dephasing, primarily driven by hyperfine interactions with nuclear spins, can limit their coherence. Here, we report the first Hanle effect demonstration in single InAs(P)/InP QDs emitting in the telecom C-band leading to experimental determination of electron spin dephasing time. Using polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we identified excitonic complexes and confirmed the presence of a negatively charged trion, exhibiting a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) of $-36\\%$ under quasi--resonant excitation. From the analysis of Hanle linewidth and employing a previously reported value of the electron $g$-factor, we extracted an electron spin dephasing time of $T_2^{\\ast} = 1.59 \\pm 0.49~\\mathrm{ns}$. Despite the large indium nuclear spin, the obtained $T_2^{\\ast}$ is comparable to values reported for GaAs-based QDs, which we attribute to the larger volume of the InAs(P)/InP QDs. These findings confirm the potential of InP-based telecom QDs for use in spin-photon interfaces."

      "summary": "The investigation of magnetic solitons often relies on numerical modeling to determine key features such as stability, annihilation, nucleation, and motion. However, as soliton sizes approach atomic length scales, the accuracy of these predictions become increasingly sensitive to the details of the numerical model. Here, we study the annihilation of two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions using a pseudospectral approach and compare its performance to that of conventional micromagnetic simulations. A central distinction between the models lies in their treatment of the exchange interaction, which governs the magnon dispersion relation and plays a crucial role to balance the uniaxial anisotropy to stabilise skyrmions. We demonstrate that both the choice of model and spatial discretisation significantly influence the skyrmion dynamics and the magnetic field required for annihilation. The pseudospectral model provides a consistent description across length scales and captures complex behaviours such as skyrmion breathing on its path to annihilation. Our results have direct implications in the state-of-the-art modeling of skyrmions and other two-dimensional textures and will impact the modeling of three-dimensional textures such as hopfions. More broadly, our approach will contribute to the development seamless multiscale model and optimization machine learning approaches for material discovery."

      "summary": "Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments."

      "summary": "Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \\textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments."

      "summary": "A distinguishing feature of multi-species boson systems is the appearance of the odd channel, in which the spins of two different bosons are coupled to an odd integer. Through exact numerical solutions of the Schrodinger equation for a medium-body cold system containing two kinds of spin-1 atoms, the effect of the odd channel on the ground state (GS) has been studied. It was found that the odd-channel causes two types of fluctuation (a mixing of various components). (i) coherent mixing, where all the components have the same sign. In this way, the probability of an odd-pair emerging in the spin-state would be smaller; thus, this way would be adopted by the GS when the odd channel is repulsive. (ii) cyclic mixing, where half selected components have the + sign while the other half have the - sign. In this way, the probability of an odd-pair is larger; thus, this way would be adopted by the GS when the odd channel is attractive. It was further found that the terms in the Hamiltonian are no longer all commutable. Accordingly, the spin of a single species S_X (X=A, B) is no longer conserved. However, its average \\overline{S_X} is well defined. It turns out that S_X and \\overline{S_X} vary with the strengths in a similar way. The former jumps step-by-step from a good quantum number (an even integer) to the next good quantum number, the latter jumps also in a step-by-step way, but from a \"real number\" to another well-separated \"real number\". Exactly speaking, each of these real numbers is not exactly a number but an interval with a very narrow width at the real axis. Thus, the GS can be specified by these real numbers. It was found that, when the strengths of the two intraspecies interactions are not remarkably different, and/or the particle numbers are larger, the widths of the intervals are narrower, the above picture holds more nicely, and the GS can be well-specified by these real numbers."

Here, we demonstrate a field-free realization of the SDE in a helical Shiba chain proximitized by a $d$-wave altermagnet. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, we uncover a topological Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting state that hosts tunable Majorana zero modes at the chain ends. The Cooper pair momentum is directly controlled by an externally injected supercurrent providing an experimentally accessible tuning parameter for driving and manipulating the topological FF phase. This state is stabilized by the interplay between the exchange coupling of magnetic adatoms and the induced altermagnetic spin splitting. Crucially, the same topological FF phase supports strong nonreciprocal supercurrents, achieving diode efficiencies exceeding $45\\%$ without applied magnetic fields. The $d$-wave altermagnet plays a dual role: it intrinsically breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling topological superconductivity, and introduces inversion symmetry breaking via momentum-dependent spin-splitting, driving the field-free SDE in a junction-free architecture. Our results establish the Shiba chain-altermagnet heterostructure as a promising platform for realizing topological superconducting devices with efficient, intrinsic superconducting diode functionality -- offering a scalable pathway towards dissipationless quantum technologies."

Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced nonlinear conductivity. This work provides a clearer and more unified understanding of the quantum-metric contributions to nonlinear transport. It also establishes a solid foundation for future theoretical developments and experimental explorations in this highly active and rapidly evolving field."

However, realistic calculations of moir\\'e band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moir\\'e unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\\'e bands from atomic symmetry data and moir\\'e symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\\'e symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\\'e bands, as long as the moir\\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moir\\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\\'e topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moir\\'e potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\\'e symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\\'e model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. By screening the existing 2D material database, we currently identify 92 monolayer materials with (i) the low-energy bands near $\\Gamma$ and (ii) the atomic symmetry data that belong to those combinations.

Using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a model system, we show that the MBC term simultaneously breaks time-reversal and mirror symmetries, enabling a quantitative reproduction of the experimentally observed phonon splittings. The analysis uncovers distinct microscopic origins for the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes: the $E_g$ splitting is governed by MBC and is accurately described by our first-principles scheme, whereas the $E_u$ splitting is enhanced by the Fano resonance, consistent with its asymmetric spectral profile. Leveraging this framework, we further predict several candidates with chiral-phonon splitting. Our results establish a predictive route for identifying and understanding phonon magnetism, chiral phonons, and related Hall-type lattice responses from first principles."

While crystal morphology due to the distribution and dynamics of the diffusion field has been intensively studied, how the intrinsic material properties affect crystal morphology remains unclear. In this Letter, we demonstrate that higher-order topological phases can give rise to hopper-shaped crystal morphologies through an unconventional mechanism originating from topological electronic states. We quantitatively show this connection by analyzing both the fractal dimension $D_f$ and the fractal dimension of coastlines $D_{f,c}$. When we compare the crystals in the trivial and topological phases with the same $D_{f}$ in the case of relatively rapid crystal growth, the former is in the dendritic shape, while the latter is in the hopper shape, quantified by the smaller $D_{f,c}$ in the topological phase. We reveal the microscopic origin of this anomalous growth in the higher-order topological phase, and find that it leads to the stepwise-depressed morphology characteristic of hopper crystals. Our theory uncovers a fundamental link between hopper crystals and higher-order topological phases, offering unconventional insight into crystal morphology governed by topological electronic states."

Among these, the polar CeO2(100) surface is a prototypical and industrially important system in heterogeneous catalysis. However, due to the vast complexity of the surface configurations, its reconstruction behavior remains an open question. Here, we report a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO2(100) surface, discovered through an integrated approach that combines global structure search algorithms, machine learning-based atomic potential models, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The reconstructed surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable, characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. Importantly, the formation of localized Ce3+ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied electronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates the O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H2O. These findings reveal a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism by which surface reconstruction governs electronic structure and reactivity, offering critical insights and a new design strategy for tuning catalytic performance on polar oxide surfaces."

This distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting significant spin splitting ($\\geq 50$ meV within $\\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi level), spanning both metallic and semiconducting systems. Crucially, our momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in spintronics and quantum materials discovery."

These DFT computations and this model predict the existence of two different types of minima, namely the 4-fold-coordinated wurtzite (WZ) polar structure and a 5-times paraelectric hexagonal phase (to be denoted as H5), for any Sc composition up to 40%. The H5 minimum progressively becomes the lowest energy state within hexagonal symmetry as the Sc concentration increases from 0 to 40%. Furthermore, the model points out to several key findings. Examples include the crucial role of the coupling between polarization and strains to create the WZ minimum, in addition to polar and elastic energies, and that the origin of the H5 state overcoming the WZ phase as the global minimum within hexagonal symmetry when increasing the Sc composition mostly lies in the compositional dependency of only two parameters, one linked to the polarization and another one being purely elastic in nature. Other examples are that forcing Al1-xScxN systems to have no or a weak change in lattice parameters when heating them allows to reproduce well their finite-temperature polar properties, and that a value of the axial ratio close to that of the ideal WZ structure does imply a large polarization at low temperatures but not necessarily at high temperatures because of the ordered-disordered character of the temperature-induced formation of the WZ state. Such findings should allow for a better fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides, which may be used to design efficient devices operating at low voltages."

      "summary": "Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moir\\'e flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the nesting vectors ($ \\mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\\lbrace \\mathbf{Q}_n \\rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action."

      "summary": "The all-electrical realization of highly spin-polarized charge currents and their efficient conversion into pure spin currents remains a fundamental challenge in spintronics. Here, we report a spin-axis dynamic locking (SADL) effect in altermagnets that pins the spin polarization to the crystalline axes: an in-plane electric field along one principal axis drives a fully spin-up charge current, whereas along the orthogonal axis, it generates an equal spin-down current. Consequently, applying an electric field diagonally yields a transverse pure spin current with 100% charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. Mechanistically, SADL originates in a distinctive tent state characterized by alternating spin-split flat bands and orthogonal Fermi-surface lines. High-throughput first-principles screening confirms SADL in broad materials (e.g., 2D Cr2WSe4 monolayer and a synthesized three-dimensional compound, (BaF)2Mn2Se2O). Our work thus opens a route to ultra-low-power, reconfigurable spintronic devices where the spin states are governed solely by electric field orientation."

      "summary": "Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases."

      "summary": "The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by the nonreciprocity of Cooper-pair motion with respect to current direction. In three-dimensional (3D) materials, SDE results in a critical current that varies with direction, making the effect distinctly observable: the material exhibits superconductivity in one direction while behaving as a resistive metal in the opposite direction. However, in genuinely two-dimensional (2D) materials, the critical current density is theoretically zero, leaving the manifestation of SDE in the 2D limit an intriguing challenge. Here, we present the observation of SDE in a heterostructure composed of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and the iron based superconductor Fe(Se,Te) $-$a candidate for topological superconductor$-$ where superconductivity is confined to the 2D limit. The observed I-V characteristics reveal nonreciprocity in the vortex-creep regime, where finite voltages arise due to the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity. Furthermore, our 2D film demonstrates abrupt voltage jumps, influenced by both the current flow direction and the transverse magnetic field direction. This behavior resembles that of 3D materials but, in this case, is driven by the vortex-flow instability, as illustrated by voltage controlled S-shaped I-V curves. These results underscore the pivotal role of vortex dynamics in SDE and provide new insights into the interplay between symmetry breaking and two-dimensionality in topological insulator/superconductor systems."

Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||."

To date, only those exchange couplings have been studied that are spherically symmetric already in the high-temperature, local moment regime. Namely, only the effects of potential scattering, dipolar spin exchange, i.e. Kondo, and quadrupolar exchange couplings were considered, and two types of NFL fixed points have been identified. However, in cubic symmetry, six independent exchange couplings can be present in the Hamiltonian: in addition to the spherically symmetric potential scattering and Kondo exchange, there are four independent, spherical-symmetry-breaking Hamiltonian terms: two quadrupolar-quadrupolar, a dipolar-octupolar and a quadrupolar-octupolar exchange interaction, where the first/second element of the compound adjectives refers to the impurity/conduction-electron transitions. While all of them flow to fixed points where rotational invariance is recovered, I found that one of the quadrupolar-quadrupolar couplings flows to a previously unidentified NFL fixed point. I derive the exchange couplings allowed by cubic symmetry, solve them with the numerical renormalization group, and present three types of NFL excitation spectrum$-$one of which is novel, at least in the context of a quantum impurity with a triplet ground state."

      "summary": "Enhancing the many-body gap of a fractional state is crucial for realizing robust fractional excitations. For fractional Chern insulators, existing studies suggest that making flat Chern bands closely resemble the lowest Landau level (LLL) seems to maximize the excitation gap, providing an apparently optimal platform. In this work, we demonstrate that deforming away from the LLL limit can, in fact, produce substantially larger FQH gaps. Using moir\\'e flat bands with strongly non-Landau-level wavefunctions, we show that the gap can exceed that of the LLL by more than two orders of magnitude for short-range interactions and by factors of two to three for long-range interactions. This enhancement is generic across Abelian FCI states and follows a universal enhancement factor within each hierarchy. Using the Landau level framework, we identify the amplification of pseudopotentials as the microscopic origin of the observed enhancement. This finding demonstrates that pseudopotential engineering can substantially strengthen fractional topological phases. We further examined non-Abelian states and found that, within finite-size resolution, this wavefunction construction method can also be used to manipulate and enhance the gap for certain interaction parameters."

A direct consequence of this discrete symmetry breaking is the charge or Mott gap itself. From extensive numerics, we proffer that it is the charge compressibility that acts as the underlying order parameter as it is zero in the insulator and non-zero in the metallic state. Additionally, the Widom line (temperature of the extremum of the compressibility) obeys a universal scaling of $T_m=0.39U$ deep into the insulating state directly from $Z_2$ universality. Furthermore, the temperature at which the second derivative of the compressibility has a minimum is independent of lattice geometry, exhibiting a universal scaling of $|U-U_c|^\\alpha$ where $\\alpha\\approx 1$. Finally, our computational approach reproduces the key features of the doping dependence of the compressibility demonstrated in recent cold-atom quantum simulators of the Hubbard model, thereby corroborating our conclusions on $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ universality."

The symmetry breakings are due to both the imaging process and the real structure of the imaged crystal, with the former cause typically dominating. A posterior algorithmic reduction of the symmetry breaking in such images constitutes, thus, often a correction for many of the distortions that were introduced by the imaging processes. Numerically quantified restorations of such symmetries can, therefore, be used to demonstrate the efficacy of a newly implemented posterior correction method for atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals. Recently developed information theory based methods are here shown to be suitable for this purpose. Thirteen experimental atomic-resolution images from graphite and monolayer molybdenite (MoS2), as respectively obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy in the torsional resonance mode, and aberration-corrected parallel illumination transmission electron microscopy served as test cases in our larger (in its totality so far unpublished) study, from which we quote here. The source code of the software that was used for our distortion corrections and the whole report on that study are freely available on GitHub."

These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases."

In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight-binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\\Delta$, on-site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that together define the underlying random graph structure. By varying $p$, $\\Delta$, and the disorder strength, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show a strong competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations across parameter regimes. Notably, even in the presence of strong disorder, skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson-driven localization. We further discuss the relevance of these results to machine-learning architectures and information propagation in complex networks and other real-world problems."

In realistic moir\\'e systems, however, the band geometry is generally non-ideal, and the mechanism that stabilizes such FCIs remains unclear. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene as a platform, we find two FCIs separated by a continuous transition driven by a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions.Below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable, and the resulting fractional phase is naturally described by the Halperin-$(112)$ state. Above the transition, the system is geometrically unstable, entering a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of standard quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this unconventional phenomenon, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: in the geometrically unstable regime, interactions hybridize electronic states near the $K$ point and generate an emergent ideal color component that supports the FCI. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a \"color separator,\" directly visualizing the ideal subcomponent in the single-particle level. Together, these results establish mechanisms which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, substantially enlarging their viable parameter space and clarifying the role of quantum geometry in strongly correlated topological phases."

All compounds investigated in the Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ series show metallic behavior, with magnetic characterization indicating that they are easy-plane, hard, ferromagnets with $T_C$ spanning 98--180 K.

      "summary": "Manganese-doped zinc sulfide nanocrystalline thin films were synthesized using a low-temperature chemical bath deposition and deposited on glass substrates for controlled durations using triethanolamine (TEA) as a complexing and capping agent. After deposition, the films were annealed at 200 degrees Celsius and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. XRD patterns confirmed the formation of nanocrystalline cubic zinc blende ZnS with an average crystallite size of approximately 37 nm. Optical measurements revealed strong transparency in the visible region, blue-shifted absorption edges due to quantum confinement, and a band gap value of approximately 3.70 eV. Mn incorporation resulted in a slight red shift of the absorption edge, attributed to particle growth and sp-d exchange interactions. These results demonstrate that Mn doping modifies the optical response of ZnS while preserving its crystalline structure, suggesting its suitability for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications."

However, rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission in MoSe2 monolayers independent of excitation polarization. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement. The fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiroptical resonances with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths. We reveal degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Our measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of ~13. Our work could facilitate the development of ultracompact chiral classical and quantum light sources."

For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes. We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system. They can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose that the emergence of 1-form symmetries is information-theoretic in nature, precisely characterized by the preservation of information about how quantum states transform under the symmetry. As a consequence, the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition which we argue to be revealed from the long-range entanglement in the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to efficiently detect 1-form symmetries with a global quantum error correction (QEC) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As a practical application of our framework, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately determined by a disorder parameter. We further argue that our proposed theory for emergent 1-form symmetries offers new perspectives on particle condensation and suggests sharp information-theoretic phase boundaries between Higgs and confining regimes in the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory."

We instantiate this conceptual question by investigating the traversal of electrons through a tunnel barrier, which we define in a triple quantum dot (TQD) system where the occupation of the central dot is energetically avoided. The motivation behind this setup is to answer whether the central dot is occupied or not during a virtual transition when it is being explicitly monitored. We investigate this problem in two different limits of continuous measurements: the stochastic quantum diffusion and the quantum jump. We find that, even though individual trajectories differ considerably across these limits, measuring leads to a higher occupation in the central dot on average. Our results demonstrate that the act of observation fundamentally reshapes tunneling dynamics, resolving the seeming paradox of detecting a particle in a classically forbidden region: weak measurements partially localize the particle, while strong measurements enforce a discontinuous either/or detection or no detection outcome."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design."

While the Zn coating mitigated corrosion of the steel substrate, it simultaneously accelerated the hydrogen entry. The hydrogen entry occurred at the bare steel surface regions exposed to the NaCl solution, with the hydrogen flux exhibiting non-uniform distribution: higher near the dissolving Zn coating. While no significant differences in Zn dissolution behavior or galvanic current were observed between 0.1 and 0.01 M NaCl solutions, the total hydrogen flux decreased with decreasing Cl ion concentration. This reduction was attributed to a potential gradient induced by differences in electrolyte conductivity. The results demonstrate that potential distribution, rather than galvanic current, is a dominant factor influencing hydrogen entry under the investigated conditions."

To demonstrate the versatility of our method, several analytical and numerical examples are presented.

In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent and emerging applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.

We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. Using molecular dynamics, we show our MACE potential is stable, reactive, and generalizes beyond training data to model HAT barriers in collagen I. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments."

We observe power-law relationships between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore, the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details.

In this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm and several complexity-theoretical results for the Berry phase estimation (BPE) problems. Our new quantum algorithm achieves BPE in a more general setting than previously known quantum algorithms, with a theoretical guarantee. For the complexity-theoretic results, we consider three cases. First, we prove $\\mathsf{BQP}$-completeness when we are given a guiding state that has a large overlap with the ground state. This result establishes an exponential quantum speedup for estimating the Berry phase. Second, we prove $\\mathsf{dUQMA}$-completeness when we have $\\textit{a priori}$ bound for ground state energy. Here, $\\mathsf{dUQMA}$ is a variant of the unique witness version of $\\mathsf{QMA}$ (i.e., $\\mathsf{UQMA}$), which we introduce in this paper, and this class precisely captures the complexity of BPE without the known guiding state. Remarkably, this problem turned out to be the first natural problem contained in both $\\mathsf{UQMA}$ and $\\mathsf{co}$-$\\mathsf{UQMA}$. Third, we show $\\mathsf{P}^{\\mathsf{dUQMA[log]}}$-hardness and containment in $\\mathsf{P}^{\\mathsf{PGQMA[log]}}$ when we have no additional assumption.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Haag duality is a fundamental locality property introduced in the pioneering formulation of algebraic quantum field theory by Haag and Kastler in the 1960s. Since then, it has played a central role, most notably in the classification of superselection sectors by Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts in the 1970s. Over the past two decades, this concept has migrated from its relativistic origins to quantum spin systems, becoming a cornerstone of the operator-algebraic approach to the long-standing problem of classifying two-dimensional topological quantum phases of matter. In physics, it is widely conjectured that such phases are classified by their emergent anyons, a view supported by exactly solvable models exemplifying all known non-chiral phases: Kitaev's quantum double models, Levin-Wen string-net models, and their slight generalizations. In these models, elementary excitations behave as quasi-particles, namely anyons, whose fusion and braiding properties form a tensor category expected to characterize the phase of matter. A major open problem was to derive the emergence of anyons and the stability of their fusion and braiding beyond these solvable models. Recently, it has been shown that a weaker, phase-stable form of Haag duality resolves these questions. However, rigorous proofs of Haag duality in two dimensions were previously restricted to systems exhibiting abelian anyons. In this work, we establish Haag duality for a broad class of tensor network models based on $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras, encompassing all Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and expected to include all non-chiral topological quantum phases of matter."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level."

We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: It is usually believed that symmetry breaking in photonic systems leads to weaker optical confinement, such as in the case of metasurfaces when bound states in the continuum are replaced by quasi-bound states with lower quality factors (Q factors). Here we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. We consider finite-size arrays of optical resonators supporting Mie resonances (a Mie-tronics platform) and employ diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses. We demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronics supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in their physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, and reversing the trends predicted by infinite-lattice theories. We reveal that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These novel findings establish a unified wave-physics platform linking both scattering and diffraction theories. Also, they outline the design principles for multi-functional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the functional renormalization group (RG) and the dual holography framework in the path integral formulation, highlighting how each can be understood as a manifestation of the other. Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation."

The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information. To address this challenge, we develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian. We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\\pm0.07)\\%$ to $(99.61\\pm0.04)\\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time. To highlight the broader relevance of measurement-induced errors, we study a 10-dimensional $^{73}{\\rm Ge}$ nuclear spin read out through Pauli spin blockade, revealing nuclear spin flips arising from hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks."
