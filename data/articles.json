These intermediates undergo a series of controlled transformations, including chlorination, fluorination, monodefluorination, didefluorination, and subsequent derivatization of N-chlorodifluoromethyl compounds, providing an efficient strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse N-fluoroalkane and amine derivatives."

      "summary": "In clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), the signal-to-noise ratio per unit time (SNR t ) dictates how efficiently one can acquire diagnostic-quality spectra. The common assumption is that stronger magnets always improve SNR t , without fully accounting for constraints on the specific absorption rate (SAR). This study analyzes how SNR t scales with magnetic field strength under realistic SAR limits. Surprisingly, for a given pulse sequence there exists an optimal field that maximizes SNR t . This insight should improve clinical MRS by prioritizing the “just right” field strength and SAR-aware pulse timing to achieve truly time-efficient spectroscopy. [Phys. Rev.

The results highlight an ill-ordered collinear magnetic ground state with chainlike defects. Monte Carlo and linear spin wave simulations enable the determination of a spin model including bond-dependent Kitaev-like interactions, compatible with this magnetic order, the excitation dispersion, and the field-induced magnetization plateau.

The results show that valence fluctuations stem from the degeneracy of the 5 f 2 and 5 f 3 configurations as well as the hybridization of the 5 f electrons with the surrounding electron bath. The 5 f bands in UTe 2 turn out to be very narrow, which naturally explains the high tunability of its phase diagram. [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 043195] Published Thu Nov 20, 2025"
