To overcome this limitation, researchers develop nano-optoelectromechanical systems (NOEMS) based on slot-mode waveguides and integrate them with quantum dots, resulting in a small, low-loss on-chip photon router. This technique offers a pathway to scale quantum photonic circuits with integrated deterministic emitters, and can be directly applied to a wide range of photonic platforms. [Phys. Rev.

The authors use focused‑ion‑beam milling to carve an air‑suspended YIG photonic crystal nanobeam that supports a confined optical mode plus colocalized gigahertz mechanical and magnonic modes. This approach opens a route to tunable magneto‑optomechanics and, with higher optical quality factors, could underpin efficient microwave-to-optical conversion for integrated quantum networks. [Phys.
