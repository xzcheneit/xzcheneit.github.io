A well-proven approach uses the spin-dependent electron reflection from surfaces influenced by exchange and/or spin-orbit interaction. This paradigmatic study of spin-orbit-influenced MoS 2 samples comprises maps for the spin-dependent reflection asymmetry and the efficiency of spin separation. The results show promising features, which emphasize the potential of TMDC-based spin-polarization detectors. [Phys. Rev. B 112, 235408] Published Thu Dec 04, 2025"

Kitaev’s solvable spin-1/2 models on a honeycomb lattice brought renewed attention to this field, with Jackeli and Khaliullin later revealing how to engineer Kitaev interactions in real materials. This review highlights theoretical and experimental developments in Kitaev spin liquids, emphasizing leading candidate materials and their broad topological properties such as chiral edge modes. Consequently, it provides essential insights for both experimentalists and theorists working on quantum spin liquid problems. [Rev. Mod. Phys. 97, 045003] Published Wed Dec 03, 2025"
