      "summary": "Batteries with liquid alkali-metal negative electrodes offer a route to compact, high-performance energy storage. Innovation in alkali-metal management, i.e., controlled storage, release and transport of liquid alkali metal, can enable simpler and cheaper cell designs. Porous carbons have emerged as potential host materials for liquid alkali metals. Here, we study the wetting interactions between porous carbon hosts and liquid sodium-potassium alloy (NaK) as a function of carbon host morphology and surface functionalization via X-ray computed tomography. While as-received carbon samples show no affinity towards NaK, heat-treated carbon is spontaneously infiltrated with NaK filling almost the entire pore volume. We explore how forced wetting partially fills pores of NaK-repellent hosts, showing large differences in pore filling based on the average pore size of the host material. In electrochemical discharge experiments, we show that both as-received and heat-treated carbon felt enable high areal capacities beyond 40 mAh cm-2. However, the heat-treated carbon shows ten times lower overpotential. Finally, we demonstrate how heat-treated carbon felt can enable capillary transport of NaK. In summary, this study elucidates important aspects of the interactions between liquid alkali metals and porous carbon hosts, generating insights into possible applications in liquid alkali-metal batteries."

      "summary": "Hyperuniform structures are disordered, correlated systems in which density fluctuations are suppressed at large scales. Such a property generalizes the concept of order in patterns and is relevant across diverse physical systems. We present a numerical characterization of hyperuniform scalar fields that leverages persistent homology. Topological features across different lengths are represented in persistence diagrams, while similarities or differences between patterns are quantified through Wasserstein distances between these diagrams. We apply this framework to numerical solutions of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, a canonical model for generating hyperuniform scalar fields. We validate the approach against known features of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, including its scaling properties, convergence to the sharp interface limit, and self-similarity of the solutions. We then generalize the approach by studying Gaussian random fields exhibiting different degrees and classes of hyperuniformity, showing how the proposed approach can be exploited to reconstruct global properties from local topological information. Overall, we show how hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with distributions of topological features in disordered correlated fields. We expect this analysis to be applicable to a wide range of scalar fields, particularly those involving interfaces and free boundaries."

      "summary": "Predicting the chemical resistance of polymers to organic solvents is a longstanding challenge in materials science, with significant implications for sustainable materials design and industrial applications. Here, we address the need for interpretable and generalizable frameworks to understand and predict polymer chemical resistance beyond conventional solubility models. We systematically analyze a large dataset of polymer solvent combinations using a data-driven approach. Our study reveals that polymer crystallinity and density, as well as solvent polarity, are key factors governing chemical resistance, and that these trends are consistent with established theoretical models. These findings provide a foundation for rational screening and design of polymer materials with tailored chemical resistance, advancing both fundamental understanding and practical applications."

      "summary": "Hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between segments of a polymer have long been known to strongly affect polymer stretching in laminar viscometric flows. Yet the role of HI in fluctuating turbulent flows remains unclear. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we examine the stretching dynamics of bead-spring chains with inter-bead HI, as they are transported in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow (within the ultra-dilute, one-way coupling regime). We find that HI-endowed chains exhibit a steeper coil-stretch transition as the elastic relaxation time is increased, i.e., HI cause less stretching of stiff polymers and more stretching of moderately to highly elastic polymers. The probability distribution function of the end-to-end extension is also modified, with HI significantly limiting the range of extensions over which a power-law range appears. On quantifying the repeated stretching and recoiling of chains by computing persistence time distributions, we find that HI delays migration between stretched and coiled states. These effects of HI, which are consistent with chains experiencing an effective conformation-dependent drag, are sensitive to the level of coarse-graining in the bead-spring model. Specifically, an HI-endowed dumbbell, which cannot form a physical coil, is unable to experience the hydrodynamic shielding effect of HI. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating an extension-dependent drag force in dumbbell-based simulations of turbulent polymer solutions. To develop and test such an augmented dumbbell model, we propose the use of a time-correlated Gaussian random flow, in which the turbulent stretching statistics are shown to be well-approximated."

      "summary": "To overcome the inherent inefficiencies of traditional trial-and-error materials discovery, the scientific community is increasingly developing autonomous laboratories that integrate data-driven decision-making into closed-loop experimental workflows. In this work, we realize this concept for thermoresponsive polymers by developing a low-cost, \"frugal twin\" platform for the optimization of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). Our system integrates robotic fluid-handling, on-line sensors, and Bayesian optimization (BO) that navigates the multi-component salt solution spaces to achieve user-specified LCST targets. The platform demonstrates convergence to target properties within a minimal number of experiments. It strategically explores the parameter space, learns from informative \"off-target\" results, and self-corrects to achieve the final targets. By providing an accessible and adaptable blueprint, this work lowers the barrier to entry for autonomous experimentation and accelerates the design and discovery of functional polymers."

      "summary": "Understanding and controlling the dynamic interactions between fluid flows and solid materials and structures-a field known as fluid-structure interaction -is central not only to established disciplines such as aerospace and naval engineering but also to emerging technologies such as energy harvesting, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. In recent years, the advent of metamaterials-rationally designed composites with properties beyond their constituents, often not found in conventional materials-has provided exciting opportunities for rethinking and redesigning fluid-structure interaction. The premise of engineering the internal structure of materials interfacing with fluid flows is opening a new horizon for precise and effective manipulation and control of coupled fluidic, acoustic, and elastodynamics responses. This review focuses on this relatively unexplored interdisciplinary theme with broad real-world technological significance. Key performance metrics, such as fuel consumption of transport systems, efficiency of renewable energy extraction, mitigation of noise emissions, and resilience to structural fatigue, depend on the control of interactions between flow, acoustic, and vibration mechanisms. Flow control, for example, which spans a wealth of regimes such as laminar, transitional, turbulent, and unsteady separated flows, is highly influenced by the ability to tailor fluid-structure interaction behavior. We survey and discuss theoretical frameworks that describe the interplay between fluids and elastic solids, with a focus on contemporary work and emerging concepts. The paper is organised into three main sections-flow-structure interactions, acoustic-structure interactions, and exotic metamaterial concepts with potential impact on fluid-structure interaction-and concludes with perspectives on current challenges and future directions in this rapidly expanding area of research."

We extend the computation of similarity solutions to non-Newtonian power-law liquid films. The bifurcation diagram, indexed by power law exponent $n$, has a highly nontrivial structure with branches merging via a snaking bifurcation around $n=1$. A countably infinite number of solutions are also found in the extreme shear-thinning ($n\\to 0$) limit, in which similarity solutions possess an exponentially small inner region. Numerical simulations are shown to be attracted to the single primary branch of similarity solutions."

      "summary": "We have studied the spin transport characteristics of a spin metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (spin MOSFET), particularly the bias voltage dependence of the electron spin polarization P_S in Si and the magnetoresistance ratio MR in spin-valve signals, to optimize the device performance. The spin MOSFET device has an 8-nm-thick p-Si channel with a back gate (G) and ferromagnetic source / drain (S/D) junctions consisting of Fe/Mg/MgO/SiOx/n+-Si. In addition to transistor characteristics with an on-off ratio of 104, clear spin-valve signals and Hanle spin precession signals were observed at 4 K in a wide range of the source-to-gate V_GS and source-to-drain V_DS bias voltages. We achieved a high P_S of 50% and a high MR of 0.35% as the maximum values in their single-peaked curves plotted as a function of the junction voltage V_J, mainly because the ferromagnetic S/D junction can generate high P_S and the spin diffusion length is very long in the Si inversion channel. These P_S and MR values are the highest ever reported in spin-MOSFETs. Our spin transport model for our spin MOSFET structure was improved in this study by taking into account the electron distribution and band profile of the n+-Si regions in the ferromagnetic S/D junctions, which enables the accurate estimation of P_S. Detailed analyses with various V_GS and V_J clarified that P_S is determined only by V_J. Our analyses also revealed that the main parameters for determining MR, such as P_S and the resistance-area products of the S/D ferromagnetic junctions, have different V_J dependences, leading to the finding that the present device does not exploit the full potential of the ferromagnetic S/D junctions to maximize MR. Based on the results, we discuss the device physics and engineering for further enhancement of MR, with a focus on the electrical and spin-related properties of the ferromagnetic S/D junctions."

      "summary": "When the concentration of electrolyte solution varies along the channel the forces arise that drag the fluid toward the higher or lower concentration region inducing a flow termed diffusio-osmotic. This article investigates a flow that emerges in channels with constant density of surface charge {\\sigma} and thin compared to their thickness electrostatic diffuse layers. An equation for the fluid flow rate Q is derived and used to describe analytically the flux of ions, and local potentials and concentrations. This equation, which allows to treat the diffusio-osmotic problems without tedious and time consuming computations, clarifies that the global flow rate is controlled only by the surface charge and concentration drop between the channel ends, and indicates that there always exist two different values of {\\sigma} that correspond to a particular Q. Our theory provides a simple explanation of the directions of the fluid flow rate and ionic flux depending on the surface charge and diffusivity of ions, predicts a non-linear concentration distribution along the channel caused by convection, and relates it to the local potential changes by a compact formula. We also present and interpret the variations of the diffusio-osmotic velocity profiles and the apparent slip velocity along the channel and show that the latter is highly non-uniform and could even becomes alternating. The relevance of our results for diffusio-osmotic experiments and for some electrochemistry and membrane science issues is discussed briefly."

      "summary": "Quantum geometry is universally bounded from below by Wilson-loop windings. In this work, we define an isolated set of bands to be Wilson-loop-ideal, if their quantum metric saturates the Wilson-loop lower bound. The definition naturally incorporates the known Chern-ideal and Euler-ideal bands, and allows us to define other types of ideal bands, such as Kane-Mele $Z_2$-ideal bands. In particular, we find that an isolated set of two $Z_2$-ideal bands with non-singular nonabelian Berry curvature always admits a Chern-ideal gauge (i.e., effectively behaving as two decoupled Chern-ideal bands), even in the absence of any global good quantum number (such as spin). This enables the direct construction of fractional topological insulator wavefunctions. We further propose a general framework of constructing monotonic flows that achieve Wilson-loop-ideal states starting from non-ideal bands through band mixing, where Wilson-loop-ideal states are not energy eigenstates but have smooth projectors similar to isolated bands. We apply the constructed flows to the realistic model of $3.89^\\circ$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and a moir\\'e Rashba model, and numerically find Chern-ideal and $Z_2$-ideal states, respectively, with relative error in the integrated quantum metric below $5\\times 10^{-3}$. Our general definition of Wilson-loop-ideal bands and general procedure of constructing Wilson-loop-ideal states provide a solid basis for future study of novel correlated physics."

In this work, we propose a general formalism that maps non-Hermitian many-body Hamiltonians to the Laplacians of Markov chains, such that wavefunction amplitudes are re-interpreted as stochastic many-body configuration probabilities. Despite explicitly preserving all state transition processes and inheriting analogous non-Hermitian localization and state-space fragmentation, our Markov chain processes exhibit distinct steady-state behavior independently of energetic considerations that govern quantum evolution. We demonstrate our framework with two contrasting representative scenarios, one involving asymmetric (biased) propagation with exclusion interactions, and the other involving flipping pairs of adjacent spins (agents). These results reveal robust and distinctive signatures of non-Hermitian phenomena in classical stochastic settings such as ecological and social networks, and provide a versatile framework for studying non-reciprocal many-body dynamics across and beyond physics."

In the archetypal Dy$_3$ SMT, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is challenging to detect and control. Larger molecular rings can offer an enhanced toroidal response amenable to direct observation and manipulation. Here we report SMT properties for the $3d$-$4f$ icosanuclear molecular ring Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$, displaying toroidal excitations of unprecedented magnitude and energy dispersion spanning a $\\sim$62 billion dimensional toroidal space. We show these properties can be modeled using an ab initio-parameterised transfer matrix approach yielding excellent agreement with experiments. To assess the bulk toroidal polarization attainable in this system, we introduce the molar toroidal susceptibility $\\xi$, a thermodynamic linear response function measuring the SMT finite-temperature toroidal polarization induced by a magnetic field with a small non-vanishing curl. Direct calculation of $\\xi$ for Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$ reveals a significant finite-temperature ground state toroidal polarization which should be amenable to experimental detection via spatially-focused magnetic field curls, as attainable e.g. using focused femtosecond laser pulses.

The deposition of VOPc in different molecular orientations allows the properties to be customized for integration into various devices. However, such customization has yet to be fully leveraged to alter its intrinsic properties, particularly optical emission. Normally, VOPc films on dielectric substrates emit a broad photoluminescence peak in the near-infrared range, attributed to transitions in the Pc ring from its pi orbital structure. In this work, we demonstrate that the dominant optical transition of VOPc can be shifted by over 250 meV through the controlled deposition of thin films on van der Waals material substrates. The weak interactions with van der Waals materials allow the molecules to uniquely self-assemble, resulting in modified optical behavior modulated by molecular phase and thickness. This work connects the self-assembling properties of molecules with their altered electronic structures and the resulting optical emission."

By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage.

      "summary": "We investigate the properties of the liquid-vapor interface in the shifted Stockmayer fluid using molecular dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble. We study the role of the dipole moment strength and the degree of asymmmetry on equilibrium interfacial characteristics, including density profiles, polar order, nematic order, interfacial polarization, electric field, and electrostatic potential. In addition, we compute angular distribution functions across the interface to gain insight into how the dipole shift affects the molecular orientation. We find that the shift significantly effects angular distribution functions by altering the polar order while leaving the nematic order relatively unaffected, in comparison to the reference symmetric Stockmayer fluid. We find that these results are consistently explained using an image-dipole construction that has been previously applied to symmetric Stockmayer fluids but has never been extended to the shifted model. We find remarkable agreement between the simple theory and the simulations in the qualitative shape of the distribution functions for both the liquid and vapor phases in proximity to the interface. Unexpectedly, the spontaneous polarization at the interface, and therefore the generated electric field, changes sign as the dipole moment strength increases. This also leads to an inversion of the sign of the potential difference across the interface."

      "summary": "For a certain antiferromagnet, the magnetization does not increase gradually with increasing magnetic field but exhibits field region(s) typically at an integer fraction of its saturation magnetization. This phenomenon is understood by the supposition that such an antiferromagnet undergoes field-induced partitioning of its spin lattice into ferrimagnetic fragments. We searched for a theoretical basis for this supposition by investigating how external magnetic fields affect the magnetic entropy of such an antiferromagnet, to find that the field region of the magnetization plateau has a single magnetic phase, but a nonzero slope region of the magnetization curve has two magnetic phases of different magnetic entropy, and that the magnetic entropy of a single-phase region does not depend on magnetic field but that of a two-phase region does. We tested these predictions by carrying out magnetization and specific heat measurements for g-Mn3(PO4)2. It was found that the magnetic entropy of the two-phase region increases with field, indicating that field-induced breaking of magnetic bonds and hence field-induced partitioning of an antiferromagnetic spin lattice are time-averaged results of all allowed spin arrangements that occur repeatedly during static magnetization measurements. The temperature-dependent magnetic specific heats of g-Mn3(PO4)2 between 2 - 6 K shows a larger excitation gap when measured at 9 T than at 0 T, suggesting that these energy gaps reflect the two successive local excitations of linear Mn2+-Mn2+-Mn2+ ferrimagnetic trimers embedded in the antiferromagnetic spin lattice of g-Mn3(PO4)2 and arise from the Boltzmann factor associated with these excitations"

      "summary": "We present a systematic investigation of all sixteen marginally relevant fermion-fermion interactions in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagom\\'{e} semimetals hosting a quadratic band crossing point. Employing a momentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on equal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the hierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by tracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The interaction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale, signaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a certain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural parameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally symmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the rotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed FP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and established by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter space. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby these FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing their susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and superconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while the $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In addition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities are presented as well. These results would be helpful to further study the low-energy critical behavior in 2D kagom\\'{e} QBCP and related materials."

      "summary": "Dirac surface states in a topological insulator (TI) with proximity-induced superconductivity offer a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana physics. However, in TIs, the Josephson effect is usually observed in regimes where transport is dominated by either substantial bulk conduction channels or unipolar surface states. In this work, we demonstrate gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson current in lateral Josephson junction (JJ) devices based on bulk-insulating (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For thinner films, the supercurrent exhibits pronounced gate-tunable ambipolar behavior and is significantly suppressed as the chemical potential approaches the Dirac point, yet persists across it. In contrast, thicker films exhibit a much weaker ambipolar response. Moreover, we find that the supercurrent becomes significantly less resilient to external magnetic fields when the chemical potential is tuned near the Dirac point in both thickness regimes. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the ambipolar behavior of these TI JJ devices and attribute the asymmetric supercurrent observed in thicker TI films to the coexistence of Dirac surface states and bulk conduction channels. The demonstration of gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson transport in MBE-grown TI films paves the way for realizing Dirac-surface-state-mediated topological superconductivity and establishes a foundation for future exploration of electrically tunable Majorana modes."

In this confined light-element Ga layer, we demonstrate interfacial Ising-type superconductivity driven by atomic orbital hybridization between the Ga layer and the SiC substrate. Electrical transport measurements reveal that the in-plane upper critical magnetic field u0Hc2,|| reaches ~21.98T at T=400 mK, approximately 3.38 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit (~6.51T). Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements combined with theoretical calculations confirm the presence of split Fermi surfaces with Ising-type spin textures at the K and K' valleys of the confined Ga layer strongly hybridized with SiC. Moreover, by incorporating finite relaxation time induced by impurity scattering into an Ising-type superconductivity model, we reproduce the entire temperature-dependent u0Hc2,|| phase diagram.

Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions.

The system exploits geometric asymmetry and utilizes the connection between the additional energy degeneracy point (AEDP) and current circulation for precise parameter detection. In the low-temperature, low-bias regime, with baths chemical potentials aligned near the degenerate energy, we find that a balanced Wheatstone bridge condition emerges when the direction of current circulation reverses, providing a direct means to determine the unknown hopping strength. We further examine the impact of environmental interactions, demonstrating that the device remains functional under moderately strong dephasing and particle losses, though extreme environmental effects eventually degrade performance. Extending the analysis to general operating conditions, we show that the device continues to function effectively at higher voltages and temperatures. Our results highlight geometric asymmetry as a robust and practical tool for quantum metrology."

We demonstrate that the dynamics is integrable for a class of exchange couplings $J(t)$ of the form $\\lambda t + p(t) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\lambda t + p(t))^2 + 4/3}$, where $p(t)$ is an arbitrary periodic function, and construct the corresponding many-body wavefunction.

The proof relies on a stratification technique from [31], characterizing the topology of the bond graph of minimizing configurations. Our second main result concerns fluctuations estimates for $\\beta\\in (0,1)$. We obtain bounds on the distance between distinct minimizers with the same number $N$ of particles, showing a sharp scaling law $N^{3/4}$ when $\\beta$ is rational, and $N^{1/3}$ when $\\beta$ is irrational and algebraic. This reveals a genuine substrate-driven effect on fluctuation laws.

In the non-interacting limit, the model hosts either a quadratic band touching (QBT) at the Brillouin-zone center or symmetry-protected Dirac nodes, depending on microscopic parameters. In the parameter regime with a QBT, our self-consistent Hartree-Fock analysis shows that weak to intermediate interactions can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and stabilize a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating phase with a finite Chern number. Interestingly, this QAH phase is found to weakly break lattice-symmetries, leading to a small but finite nematic bond order. This is in contrast to the standard QAH phase in checkerboard lattice, which preserves all lattice symmetries. Additionally, we find an enhanced bond-nematic Dirac semimetallic (BNDS) phase due to asymmetric hopping, which is thought to be absent in the Hartree-Fock approach. In the parameter regimes where QBT splits into two Dirac nodes, the QAH phase survives up to a finite staggered on-site potential. However, as the staggered potential increases, the QAH phase is suppressed while the BNDS phase grows stronger."

A key obstacle in unraveling their correlated behavior is to determine which structural and electronic degrees of freedom are involved and how they couple. Here we address this important issue with a novel approach, namely by exploring the strain dependence of electronic superlattices in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$. Using high-resolution x-ray diffraction, we track the detwinning of the $2\\times 2\\times 4$ electronic crystal and uncover a gigantic strain response of its domains. We further show that the detwinned $2\\times 2\\times 4$ phase exhibits an intrinsic 2$\\textbf{q}$-modulation and strong mode coupling. Density functional theory reveals that the structural $2\\times 2\\times 4$ modulation couples strongly to the V $3d$-orbitals, naturally explaining its pronounced strain response. In contrast, the $2\\times 2\\times 2$ phase at lower temperatures remains essentially unaffected by small uniaxial strain. This dichotomy points to fundamental differences in the symmetry breaking and stabilization mechanisms of the two electronic orders. More specifically, our results provide evidence for the active role of orbital degrees of freedom, which can realize distinct, complex ordering patterns driven by competing interactions."

An ensemble surrogate model is constructed to enhance the accuracy of machine learning surrogate models, while an efficient sampling strategy combining Monte Carlo sampling and acquisition function is applied to explore the high-dimensional compositional space. The implemented MOBO strategy successfully identifies Pareto-optimal compositions with enhanced mechanical and magnetic properties. The ensemble model provides robust and reliable predictions, and the sampling approach reduces the likelihood of entrapment in local optima.

Notably, the CHGNet-V1/V2 strategies, when integrated into the DenseGNN model,significantly outperform state-of-the-art models across 35 datasets from Matbench and JARVIS-DFT, yielding predictions with accuracy close to that of DFT calculations.

      "summary": "We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood structure. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These quantities are related by the general expression $ \\beta_2 {\\cal P} \\eta_c =-J_4 \\eta \\sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power, efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and random-regular networks), as well as the distinct ratios between the temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated."

      "summary": "The performance of conventional pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) critically relies on the wetting of the adhesive over the substrate. When the wetting is hindered by low surface-energy substrates or the presence of interfacial liquids, the adhesion is greatly compromised. Here, inspired by tree frogs that secrete mucus with surfactants to achieve good wetting over diverse dry and wet substrates, we explore a novel mechanism, osmocapillary adhesion, to use interfacial liquid modified by surfactant to wet diverse substrates and achieve robust reversible adhesion. We show that osmocapillary adhesives greatly outperform conventional PSAs over low-energy, moist, oily, and greasy substrates while achieving similar performance on high-energy surfaces."

      "summary": "Ionic liquid (IL) gating has emerged as a powerful tool to control the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials by driving ion motion at solid interfaces. In magneto-ionic systems, electric fields are used to move ions, typically oxygen, from a donor layer into an underlying magnetic metal. Although oxygen distribution is key to enabling precise and stable control in magneto-ionic systems, the spatial distribution and voltage-dependence of oxygen incorporation in such nanoscale stacks remain unknown. Here, we quantify oxygen depth profiles and oxide formation in Si/ SiO2/ Ta (15)/ HfO2 (t) films after IL gating as a function of the gate voltage and HfO2 capping thickness (2 and 3 nm). X-ray reflectivity and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed a threshold electric field of ~ -2.8 MV/cm to initiate oxygen migration from HfO2 into metallic Ta. The resulting Ta2O5 thickness increases linearly with gate voltage, reaching up to 4 nm at -3 V gating. Notably, the required electric field rises with oxide thickness, indicating a progressively growing barrier for thicker oxide films. The Ta/Ta2O5 interface remains atomically sharp for all gate voltages. This suggests that complete Ta2O5 layers form sequentially before further oxygen penetration, with no sign of deeper diffusion into bulk Ta. Thinner capping layers enhance oxidation, relevant for optimized stack design. Additionally, indium migration from the indium tin oxide electrode to the sample surface was observed, which should be considered for surface-sensitive applications. These insights advance design principles for magneto-ionic and nanoionic devices requiring precise interface engineering."

With a recently developed Bloch state tomography, we measure the expectation values of three Pauli matrices in 2D quasi-momentum space plus 1D time [(2+1)D], and then respectively extract the Berry curvature and the corresponding Berry connection. By integrating the product of these two quantities, we obtain the CS invariants near $\\pm 1$ and 0, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. We also observe transitions among these values, which indicates the change of the topology of the quantum state in (2+1)D quantum dynamics."

Using ab initio-based tight-binding parameterizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, the screened interaction is evaluated microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In direct space, the screened potential displays for both systems long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign. Upon scaling, the oscillation pattern becomes universal, with the periodic features locked to the lattice. Solving the momentum-resolved gap equations, a chiral ground state with p-like symmetry is generically found. Due to the larger Ising spin-orbit coupling, the chiral gap is more anisotropic in TaS$_2$ than in NbSe$_2$. This is reflected in tunneling spectra displaying V-shaped features for the former, in quantitative agreement with low-temperature scanning tunneling experiments on TaS$_2$. At the same time, our results reconcile the apparent discordance with hard gap tunneling spectra reported for the sibling NbSe$_2$."

By using a Corbino disk transport geometry, we were able to isolate the electrical transport properties of a single surface of our samples and study the [110] and [101] naturally forming faces separately. Studying the relationship between the applied magnetic field, current direction and crystal symmetry has allowed us to separate possible contributions to the magnetotransport anisotropy. Unlike previous studies of SmB6 surface states, we find no two-dimensional Drude-like dependence on field orientation relative to current direction, but instead a magnetocrystalline anisotropy that appears to originate from local moment scattering with a well defined easy-axis along the [100] direction. We compare these results with the magnetotransport properties of the conducting surface states on the [111] facet of FeSi. We also find evidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface crossover, extending below 1 K, which implies that the electrical transport at the surface of these materials is carried by a thin, but 3D conducting channel, which is inconsistent with the lower dimensional states expected for a strong topological insulator."

Beginning with a compendium of matrix identities and inversion techniques, the text develops the connections between spectra, dynamics, and structure in finite-dimensional systems. Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits, synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and beyond. The presentation is informal, accessible to advanced undergraduates, yet broad enough to serve as a reference for researchers interested in spectral approaches to complex systems."

      "summary": "In the journey of computer vision system development, the acquisition and utilization of annotated images play a central role, providing information about object identity, spatial extent, and viewpoint in depicted scenes. However, thermal manufacturing processes like Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) often yield surfaces with defects such as Spatter, Crack, Pinhole, and Hole due to the Balling phenomenon. Preprocessing images from LPBF, riddled with defects, presents challenges in training machine learning (ML) algorithms. Detecting defects is critical for predicting production quality and identifying crucial points in artificial or natural structures. This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect and segment surface defects like cracks, spatter, holes, and pinholes on production surfaces. In contrast to traditional machine learning techniques requiring extensive processing time and manual feature crafting, deep learning proves more accurate. The proposed architecture undergoes training and testing on 14,982 labeled images annotated using the LabelImg tool. Each object in the images is manually annotated with bounding boxes and segmented masks. The trained CNN, coupled with OpenCV preprocessing techniques, achieves an impressive 99.54% accuracy on the dataset with resolutions of 1536 x 1103 pixels. Evaluation metrics for 50 true crack tests demonstrate precision, recall, and F1-score exceeding 96%, 98%, and 97%, respectively. Similarly, for 124 true pinhole tests, the metrics are 99%, 100%, and 100%, for 258 true hole tests, they are 99%, 99%, and 99%, and for 318 spatter tests, the metrics are 100%, 99%, and 100%. These results highlight the precision and effectiveness of the entire process, showcasing its potential for reliable defect detection in production surfaces."

The corresponding Verdet constant V = $9.5\\times10^{8}$ rad T$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$, exceeds by approximately one order of magnitude that reported in other material systems.

Near-total Faraday rotation is attributed to the Hall effect with weak radiative coupling to the 2DEG in the inertial, collisionless regime, $\\omega \\tau \\gg 1$, where $\\tau$ is the charge transport scattering time. A conducting iris was used to realize weak radiative coupling. Under these conditions, Faraday rotation is strongly enhanced away from the dissipation peak at cyclotron resonance. Our work demonstrates that the classical Hall effect could be ideally suited for the implementation of ideal non-reciprocal devices."

In this work, we establish a bulk-boundary correspondence for disordered Hatano-Nelson models. We relate the localization of states to spectral winding using the Lyapunov exponent and the Thouless formula. We identify two kinds of phase transitions and relate them to transport properties. Our framework is relevant to a broad class of 1D non-Hermitian models, opening new directions for disorder-resilient transport and quantum-enhanced sensing in photonic, optomechanical, and superconducting platforms."

However, due to the small class of problems which can be solved exactly, there has been substantial interest in quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models to in turn, simulate materials and the interaction-driven phases they host. Here, we study small clusters of molecular anions of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride on NaCl bilayers on Ag(111) using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, Electrostatic Force Spectroscopy, and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, and show that the occupation and transition energies are well described by an extended Hubbard model. In particular, asymmetric clusters of four molecules require the addition of differing inter-site electrostatic interaction terms and on-site potentials, as well as asymmetric hoping terms. With $t<<U$, occupation asymmetry is driven by these terms, independent of U. The good agreement between the model and the data indicate such molecular anion clusters could be used to probe larger systems and a more varied phase space of realistic fermionic Hubbard models."

      "summary": "To evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in systems with competing interactions, we developed a self-learning quantum Monte Carlo (SLQMC) method to simulate the phase transition in the classical Holstein-spin-fermion model. In SLQMC, machine learning techniques are employed to approximate the free energy, thereby bypassing the need for exact diagonalization and significantly reducing computational cost. We assess the performance of SLQMC using both linear regression and neural network models. Our results show that both models are capable of capturing the phase transition from the antiferromagnetic state to the charge-density-wave state. However, the sampling efficiency decreases near the AFM-CDW phase transition, which is attributed to the increased mean-squared-error of the machine learning model. Additionally, the sampling efficiency decreases with increasing lattice size. This suppression is due to the increased root-mean-squared-error as the machine learning model is applied to a large lattice and the finite-size effect, wherein the energy gap between the ground state and low-energy excited states decreases as the lattice grows. Our findings highlight the necessity of highly accurate machine learning models to simulate theoretical models with complex, competing microscopic interactions on a large lattice."

Recently, we developed a incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, which extends the concept of energy bands to quasiperiodic systems lacking translational symmetry, thereby achieving a breakthrough in elucidating extended states. Here, we demonstrate that, due to the inherent duality between momentum and real space, the IEB theory also offers a comprehensive framework for elucidating localized states. Specifically, via a so-called spiral (module) mapping, the energy spectrum of localized states can be represented as a function defined on a compact circular manifold-akin to the Brillouin zone-whose form resembles conventional energy bands. These localized state energy bands (LSEBs) fully characterize all the properties of the localized states. Moreover, we show that quasiperiodic systems with mobility edges exhibit a unique hybrid band structure: the IEB for extended states (momentum space) and LSEB for localized states (real space), separated by mobility edges. Our theory thus establishes a comprehensive framework for analyzing the localized states in quasiperiodic lattices."

We use further these barriers to implement basic logic operations, including OR and AND gates, with skyrmions representing binary states. The calculatd skyrmion Hall angle for Zhang-Li type STT in PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers is ${\\theta_{SkH}^{ZL}} = 3.26^{\\circ}$. Consequently, the skyrmions propagate predominantly along the direction of the applied current with minimal deflection, a feature that renders them highly suitable for logic operations."

      "summary": "In a recent experiment [arXiv:2508.21311] the long-sought dice lattice and its characteristic flat band has been discovered for the first time in the two-dimensional layered electride yttrium monochloride (YCl), in which the interstitial anionic electrons of the electride self-organize into a dice lattice geometry. In this Letter, combining symmetry analysis, relativistic density-functional theory and realistic tight-binding model calculations, we predict that the dice flat band in YCl is intrinsically topological and characterized by a high Chern number of $\\mathcal{C} = \\pm 4$. In particular, the intrinsic atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from $4d$-electrons of yttrium atoms creates topological gaps on the scale of 20 meV near $\\pm K$ and leads to the emergence of nontrivial Berry curvatures and band topology. Displacement fields applied across the layered electride architecture can easily drive topological phase transitions. Our findings establish the newly discovered YCl electride as the first natural material hosting a dice flat Chern band without any extrinsic band engineering."

In this work, we define optimal phonon quasiparticles as those that maximize their lifetimes, and prove that the information about these quasiparticles is contained in two small matrices $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these knowledge, we proposed an optimization scheme, which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes, frequencies and lifetimes. We applied this method to silicon and cubic CaSiO$_3$, revealing their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and obtaining the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to study other quasiparticles, such as electrons and magnons."

      "summary": "Vitrimers are a class of crosslinked polymer that are capable of undergoing bond exchange reactions, allowing structural reorganization while maintaining overall network integrity. Two key features that are particularly relevant when this vitrimer concept is used to compatibilize immiscible polymer blends are how they affect the (i) bulk polymer density and (ii) interfacial activity of the crosslink groups. To probe these issues, we model both a bulk polymer melt and a thin film of a polymer melt both with explicit small molecular crosslinkers, in the associative limit, i.e., when the number of crosslinks are fixed. We show that the bulk density and the distribution of stickers within a polymer matrix is strongly influenced by their size and interactions with the base polymer. Specifically, when the crosslinkers are chemically compatible with the base polymer, then the overall packing fraction increases, regardless of crosslinker size, while it decreases when crosslinkers are incompatible with the polymers. Similarly, the crosslinkers segregate preferentially to the polymer-air interface when they are incompatible with the polymer chains, leading to a reduction interfacial tension. Thus, these incompatible crosslinkers should help in affecting both the miscibility of polymer blends, and also their compatibility by creating copolymer structures at the interface. These results demonstrate the key role of crosslinker-polymer interactions and crosslinker size on the structural and interfacial properties of vitrimer melts."

Exposing an electronic system to a constant magnetic field quenches its energy bands into a series of discrete energy levels, known as Landau levels. The Landau-level states, exact solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation in a constant background magnetic field, are natural and suitable basis to use, especially, for the investigation of strong-magnetic-field phenomena. Starting from the Keldysh formalism, we derive the quantum kinetic equation from the Landau-level basis. As an illustration, we apply the kinetic equation to calculate the electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field."

Combining a variety of concepts of quantum many-body theory, notably the nonlinear $\\sigma$-model of disordered systems, the $G \\Sigma$-formalism for strong correlations, and real time path integration, the theory is capable of describing a wide range of system classes and disorder models. It extends previous work beyond perturbation theory (in inverse Hilbert space dimensions), enabling a description of thermalization dynamics from short scattering times, through the onset of ergodicity at an effective `Thouless time', up to the many-body Heisenberg time. We illustrate the approach with two case studies, (i) a brickwork model of unitarily coupled quantum circuits with and without conserved symmetries, and (ii) an array of capacitively coupled quantum dots. Using the spectral form factor as a test observable, we find good agreement with numerical simulations. We present our formalism in a self-contained and pedagogical manner, aiming to provide a transferable toolbox for the first-principles description of many-body chaotic quantum systems in regimes of strong entanglement."

      "summary": "Magnetic inertial dynamics has recently been predicted and experimentally observed in two-sublattice ferromagnets such as CoFeB and NiFe permalloy. In this work, we investigate the spin-wave spectrum of such systems by incorporating the full magnetic inertia tensor. Decomposing the tensor into its symmetric and antisymmetric components allows us to identify isotropic, anisotropic, and chiral contributions to the magnetic inertia. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the spectrum consists of two precessional magnon bands and two inertial magnon bands. Remarkably, the upper precessional magnon band crosses the lower inertial magnon band within the Brillouin zone. We show that both cross-sublattice inertia and chiral inertia provide effective tuning knobs for these magnon band structures. Furthermore, our results reveal that the inertial spin-wave spectrum becomes nonreciprocal along directions where the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is finite. On the other hand, a nonreciprocal spin-wave spectrum can also be engineered through chiral inertia, even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These findings open avenues for engineering nonreciprocal magnonic devices and ultrafast spintronic applications through control of magnetic inertia."

Individuals are represented by random walkers, which are in one of the following states (compartments) S (susceptible to infection), E (exposed: infected but not infectious corresponding to the latency period), I (infected and infectious), R (recovered, immune), D (dead). The disease is transmitted with a certain probability at contacts of I to S walkers. The compartmental sojourn times are independent random variables drawn from specific (here Gamma-) distributions. We implement this model into random walk simulations. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a graph, where we consider a Watts-Strogatz (WS) network. Only I walkers may die. For zero mortality, we prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium for basic reproduction number ${\\cal R}_0 > 1$ and for which the disease free (globally healthy) state is unstable. We explore the effects of long-range-journeys (stochastic resetting) and mortality. Our model allows for various interpretations, such as certain chemical reactions, the propagation of wildfires, and in population dynamics."

      "summary": "Supercooled liquids undergo a rapid change in dynamics as they are cooled to their glass transition temperature and turn from a flowing liquid into an amorphous solid. Depending on how steeply the viscosity changes with temperature around the glass transition, glass formers are classified as strong or fragile. An empirical relation exists between the fragility of the liquid and the broadness of its relaxation spectrum. However, the microscopic origins of this correlation remain unclear and its generality has been debated\\cite. Here, we demonstrate that this relationship is inverted in organic materials with ionic interactions. We introduce a novel class of materials consisting of highly charged hydrophobic polymers cross-linked via moderated ionic interactions, and show that these combine a strong glass transition with an unusually broad mechanical relaxation spectrum. By surveying a large variety of ionic liquids, polymerized ionic liquids, and ionomers, we show that all these charged materials follow a trend between fragility and relaxation broadness that is opposite to that of non-charged materials. This finding suggests a special role of long-ranged ionic interactions in vitrification and opens up a route toward developing new materials that combine the processability of strong glass formers with the mechanical dissipation of polymers."

      "summary": "We investigate a quasi-periodically driven four-level system that serves as a temporal analog of topological phenomena found in four-band models with intertwined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Under a two-tone drive in the strong-driving regime, the system realizes a two-dimensional synthetic Floquet lattice, thus facilitating the realization of topological energy pumping. For a temporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and absorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a given band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands are added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange is a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model, which we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number. Interestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the drives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the presence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the perfect (imperfect) nature of the fidelity during the time-evolution of the system serves as a characteristic signature of a topological (trivial) phase."

Here, a hybrid integration approach is demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first transferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector substrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin films via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant enables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about 30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with conventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr, Ba). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane cube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization 10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable switching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we extract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on conventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost effective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon and offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics."

With this adiabaticity parameter, Husimi showed the irreversibility of the pendulum for a cyclic process, which is reminiscent of the Planck principle in thermodynamics, based on the microscopic mechanics. In this study, we generalize the argument by Husimi to a damped pendulum with friction, and highlight the role of conservation of a phase-space area on the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter. Moreover, we also investigate the second law of thermodynamics and its generalization for a general non-cyclic process as well as a cyclic process, and elucidate how the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter impacts on this law. In particular, for a general non-cyclic process, we show the law of entropy non-decrease for the pendulum without friction by using the property of the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter."

Multiple ferron modes produce intense, narrowband THz emission with quality factors up to 228 and radiation efficiencies up to five orders of magnitude greater than state of the art semiconductor emitters. Resonant excitation of a high-Q ferron mode achieves efficiencies two orders of magnitude higher than intense lithium niobate THz sources. We further demonstrate direct, non-volatile electric-field control of ferron oscillations. These findings provide evidence for multiple ferrons and establish Ferronics as a foundational platform for light- and field-driven control of quantum order, with broad impact on ultrafast electronics, photonics, quantum technologies, and next-generation wireless communication."

For definiteness we consider the Su Schrieffer Heeger (SSH) model, which on the language of lattice field theory represents 1 D Wilson fermions. We employ the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function formalism, and calculate the chiral imbalance and electric conductivity in the presence of energy dissipation, revealing how these observables are connected to the chiral anomaly. By systematically incorporating dissipation effects into the Keldysh framework, we demonstrate how the anomaly-induced contributions manifest in both axial charge density and electric current."

Here, we report directional soft point-contact Andreev reflection (SPCAR) spectroscopy measurements on the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, revealing compelling evidence for the existence of a strongly anisotropic superconducting gap pairing state. The SPCAR spectra measured with current injected parallel to the $ab$-plane exhibit an in-gap single conductance peak, in contrast to those of SPCAR spectra: a double-peak structure in the perpendicular direction. These spectra are well described by an anisotropic single-gap BTK model. The extracted superconducting gaps comprise an isotropic large gap and a strongly anisotropic gap, originating from different Fermi surface sheets. Quantitative analysis reveals an anisotropy around $\\ sim$70\\% with a gap minimum of about 0.15 meV. These results shed new light on the unconventional multiband pairing states in kagome superconductors."

      "summary": "Controlling the collective motion of epithelial cell populations is fundamental for understanding multicellular self-organization and for advancing tissue engineering. Under spatial confinement, cells are known to exhibit either vortex rotation or oscillatory motion depending on boundary geometry, but the mechanisms governing transitions between these states remain unclear. Here, we investigated the collective motion of MDCK cells confined within a doublet circular boundary, where the confinement aspect ratio, defined as the distance between the centers of two circles relative to their radius, can be tuned by varying the degree of overlap. When the overlap is large, cells form a stable vortex. Increasing the confinement aspect ratio destabilizes this vortex and induces oscillatory motion characterized by periodic reversals of migration direction, before ultimately transitioning into disordered dynamics. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we developed simulations of self-propelled particles incorporating local alignment (LA) and contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). The model successfully reproduced the experimentally observed transitions from vortices to oscillatory motion and further revealed that an appropriate balance between LA and CIL is critical for stabilizing vortex pairs with velocity reversals. Our findings demonstrate that the confinement aspect ratio serves as a minimal control parameter governing transitions in the collective dynamics of epithelial monolayers."

Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel distribution, but a Fr\\'echet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$ diverge while the density $\\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the Fr\\'echet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits, respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities. We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media."

The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems."

Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves."

      "summary": "Domain switching is the cornerstone of ferroelectric materials. Most associated functionalities can be tuned via domain switching, including but not limited to piezoelectricity, thermal conductivity, domain wall conductivity and topological structures. However, achieving the full potential of reversible ferroelectric domain switching is restricted by the incomplete access to the entire ferroelectric texture space, as well as the memory effects and energy dissipation associated with the hysteretic nature of ferroelectrics. The manipulation of domain switching behaviour is moderately attainable in epitaxial heterostructures by exploiting the valence or lattice mismatch at heterointerfaces, which is generally constrained by the necessity for two dimensional architectures. In this study, domain-engineered bulk ferroelectric heterostructures (DE-BFH), constructed via elemental partitioning, are employed to unleash full potential of bulk ferroelectrics, providing comprehensive control of domain switching characteristics and adjustable reversibility within the entire range of ferroelectric texture space. Exemplar DE-BFH ceramics exhibit unprecedented enhancement in reversible electrostrain and stability in both axial and shear modes, including a record high peak to peak shear strain up to 0.9% at intermediate field levels, confirmed by digital image correlation measurements and in-situ synchrotron XRD studies. The advancement of domain switching behaviour in DE-BFH could also promote development of new types of lead-free piezoelectric devices, including actuators, energy harvesters, multiple state memory devices, and domain wall switch. Moreover, design concept of DE-BFH could contribute to the creation of distinctive ferroelastic, ferromagnetic, and multiferroic materials by broadening its scope to the entire ferroic family, encompassing polycrystalline, single-crystal, and thin-film forms."

Here, in contrast to previous site-local Mott transition-based origins, we present a band-theory-based mechanism for orbital-selective physics in monolayer FeSe, for which only electron pockets appear. Underlying our mechanism is our density functional theory (DFT)-based observation that, for the electron pockets, antiferromagnetic fluctuations are strongly coupled to electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals but weakly coupled to those in $\\{xz,yz\\}$ orbitals. Symmetry-arguments reveal that this orbital selective coupling originates from the different intertwined orbital and Fe-site sublattice Bloch wavefunctions for these two sets of orbitals, specifically, the $x^2-y^2$ orbitals can be Fe-site localized. The strong coupling of electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals to the magnetic fluctuations enables orbital-selective electronic renormalizations that can account for important features of our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our symmetry-required mechanism for orbital selective physics can be generalized to a range of crystal space groups with four-fold and six-fold screw axes."

      "summary": "Polar topology, an analogue of the magnetic topology, serves as a large playground for exotic physical phenomena with a wide range of multifunctional applications. Polar vortices and skyrmions are representative polar topologies that have been predicted to significantly enhance the functionality and information density of nanoelectronic devices due to their ultrasmall dimensions. Despite these advantages, the practical realization of polar topologies in devices is impeded by the intrinsic challenges associated with their controlled motion and manipulation. Therefore, harnessing vortex manipulation-such as motion, on demand creation, annihilation, and shape transformation-is essential for practical device integration. However, vortex motion is often challenged by intrinsic physical limitations in collective lattice distortions and strong pinning effects from the surrounding environment, which remains elusive. In this study, we present real time observation of vortex motion in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, achieved through the application of localized pulsed electric fields and trailing bias fields from a conductive tip. Notably, the vortices exhibit reversible motion in response to the field direction. Furthermore, by precisely manoeuvring the conductive Atomic-Force-Microscopy tip along specific trajectories, we achieved controlled vortex reshaping, with reconfigured vortices showing remarkable stability over extended periods. This underline physical mechanism is further pinpointed by phase-field simulations, which revealed that the motion of the vortex boundary is controlled through the switching of the zigzag patterns of the vortex core. This study highlights the feasibility of harnessing vortex dynamics through external stimuli, advancing the fundamental physical understanding and prospects for next-generation polar vortex-based nanoelectronic devices."

A new MPC approach uses complex-valued density states to minimize immediate tracking errors against sinusoidal spatial setpoints with actuator limits and control penalties.

A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta."

However, thin epitaxial YIG has mostly been investigated under ambient temperatures, limited by the paramagnetic losses occurring at low temperatures due to the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates required for epitaxial growth. Driven by a growing interest in magnonic devices that can operate in cryogenic conditions and address quantum information applications, there is a strong need for iron garnet epitaxial films grown on diamagnetic substrates that can maintain low losses at low temperatures. In this work, we use liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) to grow ultrathin films of strained YIG on a commercial diamagnetic substrate, yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG). We investigate their magnetization dynamics in the 3-300 K temperature range, and compare them to equivalent films grown on paramagnetic GGG. We demonstrate for LPE YIG on YSGG substrates a ferromagnetic resonance linewidth below 1 mT at 3 K, together with a very weak temperature and frequency dependence of the losses. The growth of YIG/YSGG by LPE provides a straightforward approach to producing iron garnet thin films for use in low-temperature investigations."

We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy region and experimentally measure their frequencies, finding that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling.

We apply the theory to study the $\\nu=-2/3$ FCI state of the twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ system, modeling it as either a $1/3$-filled electron band or a $2/3$-filled hole band.

      "summary": "Despite sharing a common lattice structure, monolayer M$_2$X$_2$ compounds realize quantum anomalous Hall phases with distinct Chern numbers, a striking phenomenon that has not been fully exploared. Combining first-principles calculations with symmetry analysis and tight-binding models, we identify two generic band-inversion mechanisms governed by the orbital composition and symmetry representations of 3$d$ states near the Fermi level. When $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbtials dominate, a doubly degenerate $\\Gamma$-point inversion yields $C=1$; otherwise, inversions occur along $\\Gamma$-X and $\\Gamma$-Y at four $C_4$-related momenta, whose Berry-curvature contributions add to give $C=2$, distinct from scenarios relying on multiple bands inversions at a single $\\mathbf{k}$ point. The same mechanism consistently explains related two-dimensional systems, including LiFeSe, KTiSb, MgFeP, and Janus M$_2$X$_2$ derivatives. The mechanism provide practical guidance for screening and engineering tunable high-Chern-number insulators."

      "summary": "We report the nonreciprocal charge transport along the longitudinal and transverse directions in the vortex flow regime of FeSe superconducting films. Clear nonreciprocal signals under an inplane magnetic field reveals symmetry breaking at the film surfaces since the crystal structure of FeSe is centrosymmetric. Although the symmetry in such polar superconductors allows the nonreciprocal transverse response under a magnetic field parallel to the electric current, its observation is physically counterintuitive because vortex motion is not expected in this configuration. We propose that thermally excited (anti)vortices due to the two-dimensional nature of FeSe give rise to the nonreciprocal transverse signals when the mirror symmetry is broken by the inplane magnetic field."

      "summary": "Glasses are mechanically rigid, still undergo structural relaxation which changes their properties and affects potential technological applications. Understanding the underlying physical processes is a problem of broad theoretical and practical interest. We investigate intermittent structural relaxation events or ``avalanches'' occurring inside glassy regime. Contrary to the more well-known avalanches due to shear, here they are induced by thermal fluctuations in undeformed glass. By analyzing changes in structural, mechanical, dynamical, topological and vibrational properties of the system, we provide a multi-faceted characterization of avalanches. Overall we find that the system softens due to avalanches. Further, we develop a formalism to extract local measures of non-Affine displacement and tensorial strain for thermal amorphous solids in absence of any external deformation. Our analysis highlights a key difference between two types of driving: while the shear deformation response is dominated by volume preserving deviatoric strain, changes in local density must be considered to model response of undeformed glass under thermal noise. The observations suggest the idea of Generalized Strain Transformation Zones (GSTZ), where coupled shear and volume-changing deformations govern thermally-mediated plasticity. Our work paves the way for a unified description of elasto-plastic response of (athermal) mechanically deformed and thermally driven undeformed glasses."

      "summary": "This study clarifies the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel. Hydrogen pre-charging (3.8 mass ppm diffusible hydrogen), followed by slow strain tensile testing (10-4 s-1), resulted in a brittle fracture at 900 MPa within the elastic regime. Fractographic studies indicated that surface crack initiation consists of intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology; site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite. A mixed-mode morphology consisting of ductile and brittle features was observed adjacent to crack initiation. It differs from the previous investigation of uncharged DP steel, wherein a predominant brittle fracture was observed. Following significant crack growth, the pre-charged specimen exhibited predominant brittle fracture; site-specific TEM and transmission Kikuchi diffraction studies revealed {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. Electron backscatter diffraction studies were performed on the cross-sectional cracks. We explain the HE via hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism. During loading, hydrogen diffuses to the prior austenite grain boundary, resulting in hydrogen-induced decohesion. Subsequent hydrogen diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity (>Vcrit). The high crack velocity effectively inhibits crack blunting via dislocation emission, ensuring sustained brittle crack growth even after hydrogen depletion at the crack tip, resulting in {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. Based on TEM observations, we explain the formation of river pattern features on the {100} cleavage surface."

      "summary": "Wurtzite-type nitrides have recently emerged as promising candidates for ferroelectric applications, yet their magnetic counterparts remain largely unexplored. Here, we establish MnSiN$_2$ and MnGeN$_2$ as aristotypes of a new multiferroic wurtzite family that simultaneously exhibits ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism. These Mn(II)-based nitrides crystallize in polar structures and display robust G-type antiferromagnetism at room temperature. First-principles calculations reveal that nonmagnetic analogs incorporating Zn and Mg possess high polarization reversal barriers (0.735 and 0.683 eV per formula unit) and wide band gaps (4.0 and 4.8 eV), making them ideal ferroelectric candidates. In contrast, MnSiN$_2$ and MnGeN$_2$ exhibit strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions (5--9 meV per Mn site) and moderate band gaps (1.6 and 1.0 eV), with reversal barriers of 0.963 and 0.460 eV per formula unit, respectively. Despite their limited magnetoelectric coupling, we show this family of Type-1 multiferroics exhibits altermagnetic spin splitting which reverses sign upon polarization switching. By strategically substituting alkaline-earth metals, we engineer multiple materials with coexisting switchable polarization, spin texture, and magnetic order. These findings open new avenues for the design of nitride-based altermagnetic multiferroics, offering a platform for integrated antiferromagnetic spintronic devices."

However, despite decades of research, the real-space liquid structure of these interfaces remains elusive. Using three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM), we mapped Pt-water interface in real space with angstrom-level resolution. Topographic imaging revealed atomically flat (type I) and stripe-like (type II) surface nanodomains. Force-distance profiles above type I domains exhibited oscillatory decay patterns with periodicity of ~0.33 nm, consistent with water. In contrast, type II domains showed stronger oscillations with larger periodicity of ~0.45 nm and extended decay lengths, indicative of a different liquid structure with stronger correlation and ordering. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements of pure water and a series of liquid n-alkanes revealed peaks at ~0.31 nm and ~0.46 nm, in agreement with 3D-AFM observations of type I and type II structures, respectively. Our findings uncover the coexistence of two types of liquid structures at Pt-water interfaces modulated by surface heterogeneity, enabling new understandings and design principles for energy conversion applications."

The origin of this anomaly has long been the subject of ongoing debate and remains a topic of active controversy. While remaining agnostic about the microscopic origin of the phenomenon, we propose that the boson peak (BP) may universally originate from a dispersionless, optic-like excitation, which we refer to as the 'flat mode'. We revisit both experimental and simulation data from the literature through this lens and conduct further simulations in 2D and 3D amorphous systems. These analyses collectively provide supporting evidence for this interpretation. Notably, if this is indeed the case, a striking analogy emerges with similar anomalies observed in crystalline materials, where the nonphononic flat mode is effectively replaced by anomalously low-energy optical phonons."

We illustrate a cascade of topological phase transitions controllable by BCL and demonstrate how these transitions are reflected in the anomalous Hall response of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we show that the spin-textures and Fermi surfaces can be directly tuned by the relative phase of the BCL, stemming from the underlying symmetry changes.

However, studies so far have mainly considered initial localized states, whose driven dynamics follow the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization phase transition in the Aubry-Andr\\'e (AA) model starting from a gapless extended state, which violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of KZM. By linearly driving the quasiperiodic potential strength across the critical point, we numerically simulate the driven dynamics and analyze the scaling behavior of both the inverse participation ratio ($\\mathcal{I}$) and the dynamic deviation from the instantaneous ground state energy $(\\mathcal{D})$. We demonstrate that the driven dynamics starting from initially extended states satisfies the criterion for the applicability of KZM and its extension, finite-time scaling (FTS). The scaling functions governing the driven dynamics of both $\\mathcal{I}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ have been derived based on FTS and numerically validated. We found that the scaling functions exhibit significant differences at large $R$ and small $R$, and also differ considerably from the scaling functions when the initial state is localized, highlighting the crucial role of initial state behavior. The established scaling laws remain robust across a wide range of system sizes and driving rates, providing testable predictions for experimental realizations."

We showcase a prototypical experimental realization of the technique that motivates a detailed theoretical study of vortex removal mechanisms. Through simulations of the condensate dynamics during application of the optical lattice, we also discover a vortex removal mechanism that arises in narrow, optical-lattice-induced atomic density channels for which the channel width is on the order of the nominal vortex core size and healing length. This mechanism involves the density profile typically associated with a vortex core spatially separating from the phase singularity associated with the vortex. By analyzing numerical experiments covering a wide range of variations of the optical lattice amplitude and fringe periodicity, we identify the existence of an optimal set of parameters that enables the efficient removal of all vortices from the condensate. This analysis paves the way for further studies aimed at understanding vortex dynamics in narrow channels, and adds to an experimental toolkit for working with vortices and controlling the dynamical states of condensates."

      "summary": "In a series of papers, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a microeconomic framework of investors and firms. Financial agents could invest in both firms and other investors, while banks, introduced as investors with a credit multiplier, played a stabilizing or destabilizing role. Two types of interactions were considered within the financial sector: financial agents could either lend capital to or buy shares of other investors. We examined the collective states emerging from these interactions. At the macro level, we identified multiple collective states, each characterized by distinct levels of average capital and investor distribution across sectors. These states reflect the inherent instability of financial markets, with some configurations leading to default. At the micro level, we analyzed how returns and defaults propagate within a given collective state, highlighting the critical role of banks in stabilizing or amplifying financial fluctuations. However, these results were derived under the assumption that financial connections were exogenous. The present paper removes this assumption by modeling financial connections as dynamic endogenous variables. Specifically, we extend the framework by introducing a field representation of the network of financial relationships. The collective states previously identified are now embedded in a broader class of states, characterized by the structure of investment shares among investors. We show that these collective states consist of interconnected groups of agents, along with their returns and disposable capital. Depending on the strength and form of connections between agents within each group, collective states may be stable or unstable, allowing for transitions between configurations. In each collective state, some sectors may experience defaults. When the collective state exhibits specific structural conditions, defaults may spread across a significant share of the group."

      "summary": "We present a theoretical framework to describe the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) in three-dimensional (3D) electron systems. This extends our previous single-electron approach, which was successfully applied to two-dimensional (2D) systems such as semiconductor quantum wells and graphene, where insights provided into both the IQHE and the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Starting from the graphene model, where the unconventional sequence of Hall plateaux, 2(2n+1), naturally emerges from Landau quantization, we generalize the formulation to 3D semimetals with low carrier density and high mobility, where recent experiments have reported signatures of the QHE. For 3D systems, the model accounts for strong band anisotropy by introducing an effective correction to the cyclotron frequency, and, also by considering large effective gyromagnetic factor, as observed in semimetallic materials. From the calculated density of states and carrier concentration, we derive semiclassical expressions for the diagonal and Hall conductivities. The resulting Hall conductivity exhibits quantized values in agreement with theoretical predictions and experimental observations of 3D quantum Hall states. Simulations reproduce both Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations under realistic parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that the IQHE in 3D semimetals can be understood as a natural extension of the single-electron Landau quantization framework originally developed for 2D systems. This provides a unified picture of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions, highlighting the crucial role of low carrier density and high mobility. The model further suggests new avenues for analyzing thermodynamic and transport properties in 3D systems under quantum Hall conditions."

      "summary": "Ensuring the stability of the AuNP-gene complex until it reaches the target sites is a crucial factor for the success of gene therapy. Though different AuNP sizes and AuNP-to-DNA ratios are investigated for specific therapeutic needs, their role on the stability and packaging of AuNP-DNA complex remains unclear. In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of cationic ligand-functionalized AuNP (CAuNP) size and CAuNP-to-DNA ratio on DNA wrapping and binding affinity. The obtained results show that single DNA interacting with smaller CAuNPs exhibit greater bending and wrapping due to their higher curvature. However, when two DNAs bind to smaller CAuNPs, electrostatic repulsion prevents the effective wrapping which leads the DNAs to twist from their original orientation. Such behaviour is not observed with larger CAuNPs since their increased size may mitigates repulsive forces. Further, the analysis on axial bending angle reveals that smaller AuNPs induce sharper DNA bending and larger AuNPs promote smoother bending. In addition, the Potential of Mean Force (PMF) analysis confirms a stronger DNA binding affinity for larger AuNPs with affinity decreasing when two DNAs attach to a single CAuNP. Our results from the DNA loading capacity calculations provide insights into the maximum number of DNA molecules that can be loaded onto CAuNPs of a given size. These findings offer key insights into optimizing the size of AuNP and DNA-to-AuNP ratios for the development of efficient gene delivery systems."

Here, we examine the generic band topology of Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, where $C_{2z}$ and $T$ are twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and time-reversal symmetries, respectively. We discuss the Euler band topology of superfluids and superconductors in the DIII and CI Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, where the Euler class serves as an integer-valued topological invariant of the $4\\times4$ BdG Hamiltonian. Using expressions for the Euler class under $n$-fold rotational symmetry, we derive formulas relating the Euler class to previously known topological invariants of class DIII and CI systems. We demonstrate that three-dimensional class DIII topological phases with an odd winding number, including the B phase of superfluid Helium 3, are topological superconductors or superfluids with a nontrivial Euler class. We refer to these as Euler superconductors or superfluids. Specifically, the $^3$He-B superfluid in a magnetic field is identified as an Euler superfluid. Three-dimensional class CI topological phases with twice an odd winding number are also Euler superconductors or superfluids. When spatial inversion symmetry is present, class CI superconductors with a nontrivial Euler class exhibit superconducting nodal lines with a linking structure. This phenomenon is demonstrated using a model of a three-dimensional $s_\\pm$-wave superconductor. These findings provide a unified framework for exploring Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors, connecting various phenomena associated with $T$-breaking perturbations, including Majorana Ising susceptibility and higher-order topology."

Among these, 1T-TiSe$_2$ is well-known to exhibit a 2$\\times$2$\\times$2 CDW state transition at 200 K, but its true ground state nature remains under debate. In this study, we investigate possible CDW states in 1T-TiSe$_2$ and their consequences for transport properties by employing first-principles electronic structure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We identify seven distinct types of 2$\\times$2$\\times$2 CDW phases, most of which have not been reported previously. All of these phases are nearly degenerate in energy with each other ($< 1.41$ meV per formula unit). Using the band unfolding technique, we compare the electronic band structures of these CDW phases with experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data. Our findings support the presence of a possible second phase transition at 165 K and suggest a new intermediate CDW order between 165 and 200 K that was previously unexplored. This result provides a possible resolution to the conflict between previous reports on the ground state symmetry of 1T-TiSe$_2$, and opens a viable route to phase engineering of 1T-TiSe$_2$ for functional applications."

      "summary": "We derive two fundamental trade-offs for general stochastic limit cycles in the weak-noise limit. The first is the dissipation-coherence trade-off, which was numerically conjectured and partially proved by Santolin and Falasco [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 057101 (2025)]. This trade-off bounds the entropy production required for one oscillatory period using the number of oscillations that occur before steady-state correlations are disrupted. The second is the thermodynamic speed limit, which bounds the entropy production with the Euclidean length of the limit cycle. These trade-offs are obtained by substituting mutually dual observables, derived from the stability of the limit cycle, into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. This fact allows us to regard the dissipation-coherence trade-off as the dual of the thermodynamic speed limit. We numerically demonstrate these trade-offs using the noisy R\\\"{o}ssler model."

We apply our new method to superionic-state semiconductors of p-type Cu2Se and n-type Ag2S. The experimental data differentiate the two types of enhancements during the phase transition: a colossal SE (Scolossal), exhibiting an enormous value of up to 5 mV/K, and a slight enhancement in SE (Sstructure), approximately 1.5-2.0 times larger than those in the absence of the phase transition. We provide critical insights that both enhancements in SE arising during the structural phase transition are not intrinsic phenomena."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a large variety of electronic properties depending on chemical composition, number of layers and stacking-order. Among them, alpha-In2Se3 has attracted much attention due to the promise of outstanding electronic properties, attractive quantum physics, in- and out-of-plane ferroelectricity and high photo-response. Precise experimental determination of the electronic structure of rhombohedral (3R) alpha-In2Se3 is needed for a better understanding of potential properties and device applications. Here, combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that 3R alpha-In2Se3 phase exhibits a robust inversion of the valence band parabolicity at the Gamma point forming a bow-shaped dispersion with a depth of 140 +- 10 meV between the valence band maximum (VBM) along the GammaK direction of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Moreover, we unveil an indirect band gap of about 1.25 eV, as well as a highly electron doping of approximatively 5.1012 electrons per cmsquare at the surface. This leads to surface band bending and the formation of a prominent electron accumulation layer. These findings allow a deeper understanding of the rhombohedral alpha-In2Se3 electronic properties underlying the potential of III/VI semiconductors for electronic and photonic technologies."

      "summary": "Dislocation jogs have strong effects on dislocation motion that governs the strain-hardening behavior of crystalline solids, but how to properly account for their effect in mesoscale models remains poorly understood. We develop a mobility model for jogged edge dislocations in FCC nickel, based on systematic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations across a range of jog configurations, stresses, and temperatures. At low stresses, jogged edge dislocations exhibit non-linear, thermally activated dragging and a higher Peierls barrier compared to straight dislocations. Surprisingly, stress-velocity curves for a given jog configuration across varying temperatures intersect at an invariant point ($\\tau_{\\rm c}$, $v_{\\rm c}$), where $\\tau_{\\rm c}$ delineates thermally-activated and phonon-drag regimes and is close to the Peierls stress ($\\tau_{\\rm p}$). Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple three-section expression for jogged dislocation mobility, featuring minimal and physically interpretable parameters. This mobility law offers a realistic description of jog effects for dislocation dynamics (DD) simulations, improving their physical fidelity for crystal plasticity predictions."

      "summary": "Martensitic transformations drive a multitude of emerging applications, which range from high stroke actuation and, mechanocaloric refrigeration, to thermoelastic energy harvesting. All these applications benefit from faster transformations, as a high cycle frequency is essential for achieving high power density. However, systematic investigations of the fast dynamics and fundamental speed limits of martensitic transformations are scarce. Especially for ultrashort time transformations, the temperature evolution throughout the transformation is not measured, which is a substantial shortcoming as temperature is the intrinsic force driving the transformation. Here, we present a synchrotron-based time-resolved X-ray diffraction study of a 270 fs laser-induced martensitic transformation in a Ni-Mn-Ga-based epitaxial thin film. We observe the transformation from martensite to austenite within about 100 ps, just limited by the synchrotron probe pulse duration. Furthermore, a full transformation cycle from martensite to austenite and back to martensite can almost be finished within 5 ns, which is the fastest martensitic transformation reported so far. Measurements and calculations of the temperature evolution allow us to analyse the influence of temperature on transformation time. By time-resolved strain measurements we demonstrate that in addition to temperature, thermal film stress must be considered as a competing influence on the martensitic transformation. Our experimental findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations with machine learned force fields adapted to density functional theory calculations. These reveal that the huge distortion during a martensitic transformation requires the collective movement of many atoms within the microstructure, which delays the transformation."

The depth profile of defects created by low energy 200 keV electrons in single crystal high purity (type II) electronic grade diamond grown via chemical vapour deposition has been investigated. The depth profile of monovacancies created was found, using photoluminescence (PL), to decay exponentially, with decay length $12\\pm1$ $\\mu$m and production rate of $(1.1\\pm0.2)\\times 10 ^{-1}$ V/e$^{-}$/cm at the surface. The depth distribution of the neutral and negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^{0/-}$) centre, and the 733 nm zero phonon line defect formed during an isochronal annealing study have also been investigated by PL. The observed NV profiles, which do not match the vacancy profiles, can be qualitatively explained in terms of a simple model that includes the formation of vacancy clusters and the nitrogen-divacancy (NV$_{2}$) defect. The production of (NV$^{0/-}$) has been assumed to be nitrogen limited, but this paper has shown that this is not the case, with NVs lost to the production of NV$_{2}$ when the concentration of vacancies greatly exceeds that of substitutional nitrogen."

Therefore, an efficient method is needed to map the atomic structure to the electronic structure quickly. Here, we develop GPUTB, a GPU-accelerated tight-binding (TB) machine learning framework. GPUTB employs atomic environment descriptors, enabling the model parameters to incorporate environmental dependence. This allows the model to transfer to different basis, xc-functionals, and allotropes easily. Combined with the linear scaling quantum transport method, we have calculated the electronic density of states for up to 100 million atoms in pristine graphene. Trained on finite-temperature structures, the model can be easily extended to millions of atom finite-temperature systems. Furthermore, GPUTB can also successfully describe h-BN/graphene heterojunction systems, demonstrating its capability to handle complex material with high precision. We accurately reproduce the relationship between carrier concentration and room temperature mobility in graphene to verify the framework's accuracy. Therefore, our GPUTB framework presents a delicate balance between computational accuracy and efficiency, providing a powerful computational tool for investing electronic properties for large systems with millions of atoms."

      "summary": "We investigate the mechanism of chain exchange in diblock copolymer micelles using two distinct yet complementary simulation techniques. First, enhanced sampling method is combined with coarse-grained molecular dynamics to compute a two-dimensional free energy surface for the chain expulsion process in the strong segregation regime. To facilitate chain expulsion, a distance-based collective variable is biased, and the end-to-end distance of the core block is also biased to ensure sufficient sampling of chain conformations. The free energy surface reveals a bimodal distribution of chain conformations along the effective reaction coordinate. The minimum free energy pathway qualitatively aligns with the Halperin-Alexander budding-like mechanism. The free energy barrier along this pathway is calculated for core block lengths ranging from $N_\\textrm{core}=4$-$100$, and the barrier is shown to scale as $\\beta\\Delta F_\\textrm{barr} \\sim N_\\textrm{core}^{2/3}$, consistent with the Halperin-Alexander prediction for a globular transition state. Notably, the free energy surface also reveals a nearly degenerate alternative pathway in which the chain escapes by extending out bead-by-bead, in agreement with previous simulations. We also study the case of a dense copolymer melt, where the core-block shrinks but does not collapse into a dry compact globule in the opposite phase. To examine the kinetic pathway, a simplified model is introduced in which a single chain escapes from a planar interface within a mean-field background. Forward flux sampling calculations yield a linear scaling of the barrier, $\\beta\\Delta F_\\textrm{barr} \\sim N_\\textrm{core}$, in agreement with experimental observations and prior simulations. Moreover, analysis of successful escape trajectories highlights an extended chain conformation at the transition state."

However, their realization in van der Waals layered antiferromagnets remains elusive. In this letter, we report robust nonreciprocal magnon behavior in layered honeycomb antiferromagnets VPX3(X =S,Se,Te). Our results demonstrate that, in addition to their intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the nonreciprocity of magnons is strongly influenced by the layer number, interlayer coupling, and magnon-magnon interactions. More importantly, in such layered antiferromagnets, the magnon nonreciprocity exhibits an asymmetric periodic dependence on the Neel vector, offering a novel route for experimentally probing antiferromagnetic order parameters in the 2D limit."

      "summary": "The optical properties of atomically thin semiconductors are dominated by excitons, tightly bound electron-hole pairs, which give rise to particularly rich and remarkable physics. Despite their importance, the microscopic formation mechanisms of excitons remain very poorly understood due to the complex interplay of concurrent phenomena occurring on an ultrafast timescale. Here, we investigate the exciton formation processes in 2D materials based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers using a technique based on the control of excitation light polarization. It allows us to distinguish between the two competing models of exciton formation: geminate and bimolecular formation. The geminate process is the direct formation of the exciton from the initially photogenerated electron hole pair before the loss of correlation between them, whereas the bimolecular process corresponds to the random binding of free electron hole-pairs from the initially photogenerated plasma. These processes control the exciton formation time. Our findings reveal that the luminescence intensity is higher by up to 40% for circularly polarized excitation compared to linearly polarized excitation for laser energy above the free carrier gap. We show that this spin-dependent exciton emission is a fingerprint of the bimolecular formation process. Importantly, we observe that exciton linear polarization (valley coherence) persists even for laser excitation energies exceeding the gap. We demonstrate that it is the result of a fraction of excitons formed by a geminate process. This shows that two formation processes coexist for excitation energies above the gap, where both mechanisms operate concurrently."

The coupling efficiency is controlled by a thin GaN barrier of variable thickness located between them. Time-integrated and 1me-resolved micro-photoluminescence experiments show a quenching of the InGaN QW exciton emission which increases with the decrease of the GaN barrier thickness d: the PL intensity is reduced by a factor 3 for d=1 nm as a consequence of carrier transfer to the MoSe2 monolayer. This interplay between the two semiconductors is confirmed by 1meresolved photoluminescence spectroscopy highligh1ng a clear reduc1on of the QW exciton life1me in the presence of the monolayer. Interes1ngly the coupling between the QW and the TMD monolayer is also demonstrated by measuring op1cally the excitonic transport proper1es in the quantum well: the exciton diffusion length decreases in the presence of the MoSe2 monolayer. The measured dependences as a func1on of temperature highlight the role played by localiza1on effects in the QW.

Ionic evolution offers tempting opportunities for accessing exotic magnetoelectric states and physical functionality beyond conventional doping paradigm via tailoring the charge-lattice-orbital-spin interactions. Here, we showcase the precise magneto-ionic control over magnetoelectric states in LSMO system, delicately delivering silicon-compatible weakly ferromagnetic insulator state above room temperature. Of particular note is the decoupling of ion-charge-spin interplay in correlated LSMO system, a primary obstacle in clarifying underlying physical origin, with this process concurrently giving rise to an emergent intermediate state characterized by a weakly ferromagnetic half-metallic state. Benefiting from the SrTiO3 buffer layer as epitaxial template to promote interfacial heterogeneous nucleation, hydrogenation enables diverse magnetoelectric states in LSMO integrated on silicon, fully compatible with traditional semiconductor processing. Assisted by theoretical calculations and spectroscopic techniques, hydrogen-induced magnetoelectric transitions in LSMO are driven by band-filling control and suppression in double exchange interaction. Our work not only defines a novel design paradigm for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated system, with transformative potential for spintronics, but also fundamentally unveils the physical origin behind ionic evolution via disentangling the ion-charge-spin coupling."

So we present a multi-scale framework that combines the three learning-driven tools to learn in concert within one pipeline. We use high-resolution Lattice Boltzmann snapshots of fluid velocity and particle stresses in a periodic box as input to the learning pipeline. the second step takes the morphology and positions orientations of particles to predict pairwise interaction forces between them with a E(2)-equivariant graph neural network that necessarily respect flat symmetries. Then, a physics-informed neural network further updates these local estimates by summing over them with a stress data using Fourier feature mappings and residual blocks that is additionally regularized with a topological term (introduced by persistent homology) to penalize unrealistically tangled or spurious connections. In concert, these stages deliver an holistic highly-data driven full force network prediction empathizing on the physical underpinnings together with emerging multi-scale structure typical for active matter."

Most of the polymorphic crystal phases of this semiconductor belong to the family of two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors. In this study optically active indium selenide crystal phase heterostructures are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy in a well-controlled manner. It is demonstrated that by changing the growth conditions one may obtain either {\\gamma}-InSe, or {\\gamma}-In2Se3, or \\b{eta}-yIn2Se3 crystal phases. The most promising crystal phase heterostructures from the point of view of photonic applications is found to be the {\\gamma}-InSe/{\\gamma}-In2Se3 heterostructure. An intense optical emission from this heterostructure appears in the near infrared spectral range. The emission energy can be tuned over 250 meV by changing {\\gamma}-InSe layer thickness which is explained by the quantum size effect. The optically active indium selenide crystal phase heterostructures represent, therefore, an interesting platform for the design of light sources and detectors in the near infra-red. The use of molecular beam epitaxy for this purpose ensures that the structures are fabricated on large surfaces opening the possibility for the design of device prototypes by using lithography methods"

      "summary": "We consider a one-dimensional gas of $N$ independent Brownian particles subject to simultaneous stochastic resetting, with inter-reset times drawn from a general waiting-time distribution $\\psi(\\tau)$. This includes the well-known Poissonian case, where $\\psi(\\tau)=re^{-r\\tau}$, and extends to more general classes of resetting, such as heavy-tailed and bounded distributions. We show that the simultaneous resetting generates correlations between particles dynamically. These correlations grow with time and eventually drive the system into a strongly correlated non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). Exploiting the renewal structure of the resetting dynamics, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in the NESS. We show that the NESS has a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure that enables us to compute various physical observables exactly for arbitrary $\\psi(\\tau)$. These observables include the average density, extreme value and order statistics, the spacing distribution between consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a given interval centered at the origin. We discuss the universal features of the large $N$ scaling behaviors of these observables for different choices of the resetting protocol $\\psi(\\tau)$. Our results provide an interesting example of a stochastic control whereby, by tuning the inter-reset distribution $\\psi(\\tau)$, one can generate a class of tunable, and yet solvable, strongly correlated NESS in a many-body system."

Polarization analysis and incident-photon energy detuning measurements confirm the persistence of collective paramagnon excitations up to $x = 0.50$. Consistent with previous studies on other cuprate families, we observe a pronounced crossover near $x = 0.15$, where paramagnon spectral weight is transferred to incoherent spin-flip excitations associated with the particle-hole continuum. The overall behavior of paramagnons in LCCO resembles that in other hole-doped cuprates and appears insensitive to the persistence of superconductivity at high doping levels in LCCO - up to at least $x = 0.50$, as demonstrated in prior work. These findings support the view that high-energy magnetic excitations probed by RIXS are not a major contributor to superconducting pairing, in line with theories of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity."

A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity. However, existing solutions have large circuit footprints limiting scaling potential and they miss key biological functions, like inhibition. We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function. It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing. This work paves the way for two important research paths: photonic neuromorphic computing with nanosized footprints and low power consumption, and adaptive optical sensing, using the same architecture as a compact, modular front end"

      "summary": "High-throughput computational screening (HTCS) of gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) typically relies on classical generic force fields such as the Universal Force Field (UFF), which are efficient but often fail to capture complex host-guest interactions. Universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (u-MLIPs) offer near-quantum accuracy at far lower cost than density functional theory (DFT), yet their large-scale application in adsorption screening remains limited. Here, we present a hybrid screening strategy that merges Widom insertion Monte Carlo simulations performed with both UFF and the PreFerred Potential (PFP) u-MLIP to evaluate the adsorption performance of a large MOF database, using ethylene capture under humid conditions as a benchmark. From a curated set of MOFs, 88 promising candidates initially identified using UFF-based HTCS were re-evaluated with the PFP u-MLIP, benchmarked against DFT calculations to refine adsorption predictions and assess the role of framework flexibility. We show that PFP u-MLIP is essential to accurately assess the sorption performance of MOFs involving strong hydrogen bonding or confinement pockets within narrow pores, effects poorly captured using UFF. Notably, accounting for framework flexibility through full unit cell relaxation revealed deviations in ethylene affinity of up to 20 kJ mol-1, underscoring the impact of guest-induced structural changes. This HTCS workflow identified seven MOFs with optimal pore sizes, high ethylene affinity, and high C2H4/H2O selectivity, offering moisture-tolerant performance for applications from food packaging to trace ethylene removal. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately capturing host-guest energetics and framework flexibility, and demonstrate the practicality of incorporating u-MLIPs into scalable HTCS for identifying top MOF sorbents."

In the absence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the spectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized line for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$ chain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon modes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ chains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we disentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After including the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution of the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the Haldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation spectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the order of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the line of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined, and the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from the transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across the phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases, revealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase transitions. This study presents the dynamical structure factor corresponding to the ground state phase diagram and establishes a unified quasiparticle framework for understanding the fundamental nature of excitations across distinct quantum phases in frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg spin chains."

Our experimental results revealed a significant linear dichroic signal, indicating strong trigonal distortion in the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. We performed a detailed analysis of the experimental XAS and XMCD spectra using a full-multiplet configuration-interaction cluster model. This analysis unveiled that the $t_{2g}$ hole density is predominantly localized in the $a_{1g}$ orbital. Through XMCD sum rules and theoretical calculations, we quantified both the spin and orbital magnetic moments. Our study demonstrates that the local electronic structure of the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra displays an effective trigonal distortion of approximately $-0.114$ eV. This distortion is larger than the Co $3d$ spin-orbit coupling constant, emphasizing the crucial impact of local structural distortions on the electronic and magnetic properties of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$."

Here we apply biaxial anisotropic strain to detwin $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ single crystals and directly visualize the intrinsic magnetic excitations using inelastic neutron scattering. We discover that the low-energy spin waves emerge from the $M$ points -- transverse to the magnetic Bragg peaks -- providing direct evidence of anisotropic magnetic interactions in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. The intrinsic spin-wave spectrum imposes stringent constraints on the extended Kitaev Hamiltonian, yielding a refined, quantitatively consistent set of exchange couplings for the zigzag ground state and its low-energy dynamics. Above the magnon band, we uncover broad excitation continua: while a twofold-symmetric feature near 6 meV at $\\Gamma$ is consistent with bimagnon scattering, the dominant spectral weight forms a sixfold-symmetric continuum extending up to $\\sim 16$ meV that cannot be explained by conventional magnons. This strongly supports the presence of fractionalized excitations-a hallmark of Kitaev QSL physics. Our findings establish biaxial strain as a powerful symmetry-breaking probe to access the intrinsic spin dynamics of Kitaev materials and provide critical benchmarks for refining theoretical models of quantum magnetism in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$."

To demonstrate the possible outcomes, the Hertzian potential energy is used as a model for pairwise molecular interactions, which is known to support coexistent hexagonal and square lattices. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we show that at least four different disclination morphologies arise in a square-rich background: triangular defect domains composed of hexagonal lattices arranged in a cubic formation, bridged cubic state, linear scar disclinations with no hexagon content, and open scar disclinations containing a significant amount of hexagonal lattice in the open regions. Order parameters are also introduced to highlight the significance of the bridged and open-scar disclinations, both being the new morphologies reported in this study. The fact that the bridged state is an energetically preferred one is further demonstrated by a separate elastic energy model, which confirms its prevalence over the unbridged cubic state."

Here we reveal an unexplored altermagnetic proximity effect (AMPE), distinct from its ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic counterparts. Using first-principles and model analyses of van der Waals heterostructures based on the prototypical altermagnet V$_2$Se$_2$O, we show that its hallmark momentum-alternating spin splitting can be directly imprinted onto adjacent nonmagnetic layers -- a process we term altermagnetization. This is demonstrated in a monolayer PbO through characteristic band splitting and real-space spin densities, with systematic dependence on interlayer spacing and magnetic configuration. We further predict broader AMPE manifestations: Valley-selective spin splitting in a monolayer PbS and a topological superconducting phase in monolayer NbSe$_2$, both inheriting the alternating $k$-space spin texture of the altermagnet. These results establish AMPE not only as a distinct proximity mechanism, but also as a powerful method of using altermagnetism in designing emergent phenomena and versatile applications."

We compute the spin Hall conductivity and demonstrate that it diverges and gives rise to a resonance when chemical potential passes through those spin-degenerate or anti-crossing points. Contrary to the previous studies, here such resonance emerges even without any external perturbation like magnetic field or light. In addition, we examine the influence of anisotropy in Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, as well as finite-temperature effects, and show that the inter subband resonance remains robust. Finally, we also investigate the signature of such additional spin degeneracy and anti-crossing points in the longitudinal conductance by using retarded Green function approach in lattice model. The peculiar features of the bands are reflected in the longitudinal conductance, which takes quantized values of $2n e^{2}/{h},$ where $n$ denotes the number of bands occupied by the chemical potential with each band having spin split sub-bands."

Rev. Lett. 76, 503-506, 1996) motivate a minimal one-band view that largely integrates out oxygen. By contrast, altermagnetism (Phys. Rev. X 12, 040501, 2022) yields a d-wave-like k-space magnetic texture from alternatingly rotated nonmagnetic cages; La2CuO4 (the parent of a high-Tc cuprate) is a prototypical example. As a proof of principle, we show in La2CuO4 that an alternating local pairing potential on the two Cu sublattices (plus/minus s(r)) produces a nodal, d-wave-like Delta(k). Since orthorhombic tilts are not the driver (and even suppress superconductivity in nickelates; Nature 621, 493, 2023), we then show that the in-plane oxygen sublattice of CuO2/NiO2 layers - ubiquitous in cuprates and nickelates - intrinsically realizes the same symmetry. Imposing an oxygen-centered, staggered s pairing yields a d-wave gap with perfect C4 symmetry, demonstrated self-consistently in NdNiO2 from first principles. While the microscopic origin remains open, we outline possible scenarios, and our real-space construction maps directly onto lattice models, placing superconductivity and Hubbard physics on the same footing."

Using density functional theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we compute their Fermi surfaces, transmission coefficients, and orbital-projected density of states.

Depending on the tilt strength, Rabi oscillations between adjacent lowest enegy bands caused by Landau-Zener tunneling, can induce that the one-cycle-averaged drift displacement is fraction, which is relate to the ratio of the sum of Chern numbers of multiple bands to the number of energy bands involved in Landau Zener tunneling. As representative examples, we construct fractional (1/3, 1/2) quantize drift only via adjusting period of lattice. The numerical simulations allow us to consider a realistic setup amenable of an experimental realization.

      "summary": "Evaporative lithography in cells of arbitrary configuration allows for the creation of diverse particle deposition patterns due to the formation of a specific flow structure in the liquid caused by non-uniform evaporation. The latter in turn is determined by the shape of the liquid layer surface and the wetting menisci on the cell walls. Thus, predicting the shape of the wetting menisci can serve as a tool for controlling the process of creating desired particle deposition patterns and evaporation dynamics. Here, we propose a simple and sufficiently accurate methodology for determining the shape of the liquid meniscus in cells of arbitrary geometric shape, based on a combination of mathematical modeling and a series of experimental measurement techniques. The surface profiles of the liquid meniscus in cylindrical, square, and triangular cells were determined by measuring the change in the reflection angle of a laser beam from the free liquid surface while scanning from the cell wall to its center. The height of the wetting meniscus on the inner cell wall and the minimum liquid layer thickness at the center of the cell were measured by analyzing optical images and using a contact method, respectively. 3D meniscus profiles were obtained by numerically solving the Helmholtz equation. The boundary conditions and the unknown constant in the equation were determined based on experimental data obtained for several local points or cross-sections. A comparison of the simulated meniscus shapes and experimentally obtained local values showed satisfactory agreement, with an error of less than 14%."

      "summary": "Ferromagnetic superconductors, where ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist despite their antagonism, exhibit strikingly diverse behaviors. Depending on the interplay between the ferromagnetic exchange field and the superconducting condensate, superconductivity may vary with temperature monotonically, non-monotonically, or even reentrantly, all of which can be tuned by external magnetic fields. Here, we present a unified theoretical framework and construct comprehensive phase diagrams that capture these regimes and predict new phenomena, including doublereentrant superconductivity. We further demonstrate how magnetic fields drive systematic shifts between distinct temperature-dependent behaviors, thereby explaining recent experimental results and predicting new transitions. In addition, we show that the field-induced enhancement of superconductivity, previously observed as a slight increase in Tc, can under certain conditions become dramatic."

      "summary": "We propose and analyze a new variation of the so-called {\\em exponential Hopfield model}, a recently introduced family of associative neural networks with unprecedented storage capacity. Our construction is based on a cost function defined through exponentials of standard quadratic loss functions, which naturally favors configurations corresponding to perfect recall. Despite not being a mean-field system, the model admits a tractable mathematical analysis of its dynamics and retrieval properties that agree with those for the original exponential model introduced by Ramsauer and coworkers. By means of a signal-to-noise approach, we demonstrate that stored patterns remain stable fixed points of the zero-temperature dynamics up to an exponentially large number of patterns in the system size. We further quantify the basins of attraction of the retrieved memories, showing that while enlarging their radius reduces the overall load, the storage capacity nonetheless retains its exponential scaling. An independent derivation within the perfect recall regime confirms these results and provides an estimate of the relevant prefactors. Our findings thus complement and extend previous studies on exponential Hopfield networks, establishing that even under robustness constraints these models preserve their exceptional storage capabilities. Beyond their theoretical interest, such networks point towards principled mechanisms for massively scalable associative memory, with potential implications for both neuroscience-inspired computation and high-capacity machine learning architectures."

However, realistic calculations of moir\\'e band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moir\\'e unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\\'e bands from atomic symmetry data and moir\\'e symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\\'e symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\\'e bands, as long as the moir\\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moir\\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\\'e topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moir\\'e potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\\'e symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\\'e model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

By systematically varying hopping strength, onsite interactions, Stark potentials, and random disorder, we probe relaxation dynamics toward a common steady state using trace distance, relative entropy, entanglement asymmetry, and $\\ell_1$-norm of coherence metrics. Our results reveal that QME emerges prominently in the clean-interacting regime, where many-body correlations drive nonlinear relaxation pathways, enabling initially distant states to overtake closer ones. In contrast, non-interacting systems exhibit conventional thermalization, whereas Stark potentials and random disorder suppress QME by inducing localization barriers, with disorder causing milder delays compared to the pronounced effects of Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry proves to be particularly sensitive to the symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME. These findings elucidate the critical role of interactions in anomalous relaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in experimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems."

Yet it remains unclear how optical excitation can dynamically produce long-range phase coherence-a defining feature of true order such as superconductivity-rather than merely enhancing local pairing. Here we show that impulsively driven low-frequency phonons enhance long-range electronic correlations in a low-dimensional metal. Through numerically exact simulations, we demonstrate that slow phonons suppress dynamical disorder, enabling buildup of coherence and enhancement of charge (and pairing) orders. These findings provide direct evidence that light can mediate enhancement of long-range order and suggest that future experimental strategies-such as the design of selective excitations of narrow phonon distributions to limit dephasing-may offer viable routes to design and stabilize transient superconducting states."

      "summary": "Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed understanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body decay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work investigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The three-body Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic representation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is obtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate coefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength where the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the threshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally averaged $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the experiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ also explicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi energies $E_{F}^{(i)}\\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy is reduced, $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and becomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and cross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary collisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body recombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the atom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products, rather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a significant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped ensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a plausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay."

Recent measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor (DSF) in cuprate ladder compounds have indicated the presence of a large effective attraction in the single-band Hubbard model, possibly mediated by phonons. Here, we demonstrate that similar DSF features can also be captured by $t$-$J$ descriptions with or even without any attractive term. Motivated by this observation, we systematically investigate the strength and origin of different contributions to the single-band Hamiltonians by downfolding either from the three-band Emery model or the electron-phonon coupled Hubbard-Holstein model. For one-dimensional systems, we find that the extended versions of both single-band descriptions can reproduce the experimentally observed DSF signatures. Finally, we extend our analysis to two dimensions by comparing two-hole correlation functions for the different single-band models. Our results provide new insights into the long-standing question of which single-band Hamiltonian can capture the essential physics of cuprates."

The total quantum work and the corresponding efficiency of the heat engine can be enhanced due to the coherence consumption of the demon. In addition, we discuss an universal information heat engine driven by quantum coherence. The extractable work of this heat engine is limited by the quantum coherence, even if it has no classical thermodynamic cost.

By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\\sim 1$ GHz). This approach simultaneously enhances gate fidelity while preserving spectral isolation, ensuring compatibility with existing all-microwave controlled-Z gate frameworks. The protocol exhibits intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced qubit parameter variations.

This study estimates future iridium demand for PEMEL under various deployment scenarios and technological advances. Results show that meeting net zero targets will require both significant improvements in catalyst efficiency and access to roughly 30\\% of global iridium production annually.

The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by coupling a low bandgap ($\\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\\%$ (estimated as $42.8\\%$ for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of $\\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature."

In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the R\\'enyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration.

      "summary": "The multimode ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime has emerged as a novel platform for accessing previously inaccessible phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Of particular interest are cavity-mediated correlations between local and nonlocal excitations, or equivalently, between modes at zero and finite in-plane momentum modes, which offer new opportunities for controlling light--matter interactions across space. However, direct experimental evidence of such interactions has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal multimode coupling in a Landau polariton system, where cavity photons simultaneously interact with the zero-momentum cyclotron resonance and finite-momentum magnetoplasmons of a two-dimensional electron gas in a GaAs quantum well. Our slot cavities, with their subwavelength mode volumes, supply in-plane momentum components that enable the excitation of finite-momentum matter modes. Terahertz time-domain magnetospectroscopy measurements reveal a clear splitting of the upper-polariton branch, arising from hybridization between magnetoplasmon modes and the cavity--cyclotron-resonance hybrids. Extracted coupling strengths confirm USC of the cyclotron resonance and strong coupling of the magnetoplasmon modes to the cavity field, respectively. The experimental results are well captured by the multimode Hopfield model and finite-element simulations. These findings establish a pathway for engineering multimode light--matter interactions involving zero- and finite-momentum matter modes in the USC regime."

Relying on partially lifted random duality theory (pl RDT) concepts we introduce an analytical mechanism that produces easy to compute lower and upper GSE bounds for \\emph{any} spin sets. We uncover that these bounds actually match in case of fully spherical sets thereby providing optimal GSE values for spherical multipartite pure $p$-spin models. Numerical evidence further suggests that our upper and lower bounds may match even in the Ising scenarios. As such developments are rather intriguing, we formulate several questions regarding the connection between our bounds matching generality on the one side and the spin sets structures on the other."

The decay exhibits a universal fast transient, scaling as $L\\propto t^{-2}$, followed by a slower non-universal regime that depends on the geometry and flow conditions. We demonstrate that this behavior is governed by the interplay between vortex pinning on the disordered topography of the channel walls and the mobilizing effect of the weak probe flow.

The trained network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions, showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques."

When multiple mechanical oscillators are coupled to a single electromagnetic mode, these interactions can be extended to utilize the electromagnetic mode as a mediator for distributing noise squeezing among different mechanical oscillators. We investigate the transfer of mechanical noise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave cavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing in one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of its resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously, optomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical modes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode (target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical modes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from the squeezing in the control mode. Remarkably, the observed squeezing transfer manifests noise characteristics of both single-mode and two-mode squeezing. This unique feature suggests that the squeezing transfer holds significant potential for enhancing precision measurements."

This capability allows us to reveal interaction-driven shifts of the exceptional point separating quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes, and to demonstrate interaction-enhanced decay. By exploiting interaction-dependent energy level shifts, we observe a configuration-selective two-body Zeno effect that freezes target spin states. We theoretically show that when this mechanism is extended to many-body chains it allows for the dissipative distillation of unwanted spin configurations. These experimental studies establish a versatile approach for exploring strongly interacting, open quantum spin systems, and opens possible new routines for dissipative preparation of correlated quantum states in Rydberg atom arrays."

Through real-time simulations of gravitational dynamics, which are spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic and are confined within two dynamical bulk branes, we identify three distinct thermalization patterns governed by the energy imbalance (temperature difference) and system size. For systems with large size and small energy imbalance, we observe recurrent cycles of formation and collapse of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). Under large energy imbalance, shock waves persist for a prolonged period with sustained boundary reflections, while rarefaction waves rapidly homogenize. When the system size is sufficiently small, dissipation dominates and leads to oscillatory decay without sustained NESS or shock structure. In sharp contrast to diffusive systems, we uncover that wave-propagated energy transfer together with boundary reflections enables nearly complete energy swapping between subsystems during thermalization. Our results reveal rich thermalization dynamics in finite-size quantum critical systems across spatial scales and energy gradient regimes."

In this work, we investigate the dissipative dynamics of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model by coupling it to a Markovian environment. We find that quantum dissipation can enhance localization: memory of the initial state is retained more robustly under dissipative evolution than under unitary dynamics. This dissipation-induced enhancement of localization persists across a variety of initial states, indicating that the effect is not limited to fine-tuned configurations. Our results demonstrate that dissipation, often associated with decoherence and thermalization, can in fact serve as a powerful tool for stabilizing non-ergodic behavior in gauge-constrained quantum systems."

In this work, focusing on generalized Aubry-Andr\\'{e}-Harper models, we demonstrate that high-harmonic generation phenomenon serves as a powerful probe of localization transitions and mobility edges in quasicrystals. We introduce a new order parameter--dipole mobility--which captures the impact of intraband dipole transitions and enables classification of nonlinear optical regimes, where excitation and high-harmonic generation yield can differ by orders of magnitude.

There, polarization emerged as a spontaneous symmetry-breaking process with a randomly selected direction. Here using a mean-field analysis and Monte Carlo simulations I show that this mechanism is highly vulnerable to minimal distortions. An external symmetry-breaking field, even vanishingly small, suffices to impose a global direction and suppress opposite domains, producing distorted full polarization. In contrast, a handful of quenched local fields with zero average do not erase polarization but reorganize it into opposing domains. Remarkably, as few as two opposed fields, if placed at tipping sites, can redirect the entire system. These fragile sites, indistinguishable from others, act as hidden tipping points that amplify microscopic biases into macroscopic outcomes. Difference in local field proportions is found to be instrumental to guarantee a winning majority. The results highlight how minimal, strategically placed interventions can override autonomous self-organization. The results could, if applicable on social media platforms, question their presumed democratic nature of consensus."

This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the asymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the near-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful toolkit for its application."

Despite its fundamental importance, capturing this flow field and unraveling its biological implications remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we report the first direct, time-resolved measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) flow field generated by a single, free-swimming microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a widely studied model organism for flagellar motility. Supported by hydrodynamic modeling and simulations, our measurements resolve how established two-dimensional (2D) flow features such as in-plane vortices and the stagnation point emerge from and shape the 3D structure of the algal flow. More importantly, we reveal unexpected low-Reynolds-number flow phenomena including micron-sized vortex rings and a periodic train of traveling vortices and uncover topological changes in the underlying fluid structure associated with the puller-to-pusher transition of an alga, substantially deepening our understanding of algal motility. Biologically, access to the complete 3D flow field enables rigorous quantification of the alga's energy expenditure, as well as its swimming and feeding efficiency, significantly improving the precision of these key physiological metrics. Taken together, our study demonstrate extraordinary vortex dynamics in inertialess flows and advances fundamental knowledge of microhydrodynamics and its influence on microbial behavior. The work establishes a powerful method for comprehensively mapping the fluid environment sculpted by the beating flagella of motile cells."

      "summary": "Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets."

While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations."

We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario."

QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical states from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems."

Charge transport through a molecular orbital connected to two leads and exchange-coupled with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin in a constant magnetic field is studied here. Both the magnetic field and the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin modulate the total precession frequency. The precessing molecular magnetization drives inelastic tunneling processes between electronic quasienergy levels. The dc-bias voltages allow to unveil the quasienergy levels, Larmor frequency, and the anisotropy parameter, through characteristics of charge-transport measurements involving features such as steps, peaks and dips. Quantum interference effects between states connected with spin-flip events are reflected in the shot noise as peak-dip (dip-peak) features, resembling Fano-like resonance profiles, and are controlled by the anisotropy parameter and Larmor frequency. Under zero bias, the increase of the anisotropy parameter enables the decrease of the precession frequency or alters the precession direction, and shot noise is reduced. Furthermore, it is possible to adjust the anisotropy parameter to suppress the precession frequency, leading to the suppression of shot noise. The results show that in the given setup, the charge current and shot noise can be controlled by the magnetic anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin."

Our electrical transport and synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies up to 224 GPa reveal the emergence of \\textbf{two distinct superconducting phases} from a charge-ordered insulating state. The first phase (SC-I) appears around 18 GPa, forming a superconducting dome that peaks at 18.2 K at 133 GPa. Above 111.8 GPa, a second, lower-Tc phase (SC-II) emerges and coexists with SC-I over a broad pressure range. These superconducting phases are intimately linked to a cascade of structural transitions that systematically distort the frustrated pyrochlore lattice of Ir atoms. Our results redefine the potential for superconductivity in spinels and showcase a pathway to high-Tc pairing directly from a correlated insulating state driven by lattice tuning."

The compound is induced by intercalating 0.25 Cr atom per unit cell within the van der Waals gaps of CrTe$_2$. In this work, we report a notably increased Curie Temperature and an emergent in-plane spin fluctuation by slightly reducing the concentration of Cr intercalants in Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$. Moreover, the intercalated Cr atoms form a metastable 2$\\times$2 supercell structure that can be manipulated by electron beam irradiation.

While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point.

Magnetic measurements showed a transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism around x = 0.7. For x = 0.5, the low (< 0.3 $\\mu_{B}$) magnetic moments suggest itinerant magnetism despite the relatively high Curie temperature (up to 225 K). Theoretical calculations indicated different types of magnetic orderings depending on the Fe/Ni atomic order, with the antiferromagnetic state being stable for ordered FeNiB$_{2}$, whereas the ground state is ferromagnetic for the disordered alloy. Calculations also predicted the coexistence of low- and high-spin states in Fe atoms around the composition with x=0.5, in line with the experimental evidence from $^{57}$Fe M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy. The two magnetically distinct Fe sites for x = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 observed by $^{57}$Fe M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy can also be interpreted as two magnetically different regions or clusters that could affect the critical behavior near a quantum magnetic transition based on a potential ferromagnetic quantum critical point identified computationally and experimentally near x=0.64. This work highlights the complex interplay between structure and magnetism in Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B alloys, suggesting areas for future research on quantum critical behavior."

These 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of ~12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T-CrTe2 layer.

Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a quasi-two-dimensional spin helix phase within the localized spins emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity, reflected in the scaling exponents of various correlation functions, accessible through electrical means and by adjusting the twist angle. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids. Integrating critical aspects of Luttinger liquid physics, magnetism, and Kondo physics in twisted bilayer graphene, our findings offer insights into similar correlated phenomena across a broad range of twisted van der Waals structures."

Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems."

Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material."

      "summary": "We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of semiflexible polymers driven by motor proteins (MPs) in two-dimensional motility assays under harmonic confinement. Using a coarse-grained agent-based model that incorporates stochastic motor attachment, detachment, and force generation, we study how activity, filament rigidity, and confinement interact to control polymer behavior. We construct dynamical behavior maps as a function of P\\'eclet number, motor processivity, and trap strength. We find a two-state transition from a trapped to a free polymer, with an intermediate coexistence region, and obtain a scaling relation for the critical P\\'eclet number, which is supported by simulation data across a range of parameters. Polymer flexibility strongly influences confinement: flexible filaments are more easily trapped, while increasing rigidity destabilizes confinement. Processivity of MPs can also induce a change in the effective rigidity of the polymer and, therefore, influence confinement by the trap. Under moderate confinement and activity, we observe the emergence of stable spiral conformations. The center-of-mass dynamics is analyzed through the mean square displacement, showing diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes that depend on the trap strength and activity. Additionally, time series analysis of the excess kurtosis shows the variation of the non-Gaussian fluctuations with trap strength and activity. Our results provide a minimal physical framework to understand the dynamic organization of active filaments under confinement, with relevance to in vitro motility assays, cytoskeletal filament manipulation by optical traps, and synthetic active polymer systems."

Above 80 K, both $\\mu$SR and M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectra show temperature-dependent inhomogeneous broadening either due to structural or charge disorder and changing spin dynamics that can be related to a precursor magnetic phase above the well-defined static low-temperature phase."

      "summary": "Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the Kitaev model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator RuCl3. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review begins with a brief review on QSLs in other systems, followed by a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on RuCl3. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives."

The stochastic description of physical systems based on stochastic storage models is associated with generalized Poisson (or shot) noise, in which the jump values can be quite large. Stochastic storage models have a direct physical meaning: some elements enter the system and leave it. Storage processes fit into the general scheme of dynamic systems subject to the additive influence of a random process. The main relationships of storage models are described, and the possibilities of applying the mathematical provisions of stochastic storage processes to various physical problems are indicated. A number of examples of applying the stochastic storage model are considered."

      "summary": "Kondo screening of local moments in normal metals typically leads to hybridized conduction and valence bands separated by a Kondo gap, resulting in an insulating state at half-band filling. We show a dramatic change of this scenario in a Dirac-semimetal-based correlated system -- a bilayer honeycomb lattice heterostructure where the local moment lattice is stacked on a Dirac semimetal breaking the inversion symmetry. This system is modeled by an extended Anderson honeycomb lattice involving the real-space dependence of major interlayer hybridization parameters on the relative sliding distance along the armchair direction. First, we unveil the multiple Kondo scales and the successive Kondo breakdown transitions in this correlated heterostructure under sliding. Second, we demonstrate the existence of a genuine selective Kondo screening phase which is stabilized near the A-B stack pattern and is accessible by applying the interlayer voltage. Third, we find a nearly flat hybridized band located concomitantly within the Kondo gap, resulting in an unprecedented metallic state at the half-band filling. This unconventional heavy fermion state is characterized by the violation of Luttinger theorem and the appearance of a Van Hove singularity at the Fermi energy. The general sliding-driven band structure landscape and the implications of our results for the broad context of multiorbital Kondo physics are briefly discussed."

      "summary": "The kinetic process of mechanical amorphization plays a central role in tailoring material properties. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how this process depends on loading parameters is critical for optimizing mechanical amorphization and tuning material performance. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate oscillatory deformation-induced amorphization in three glass-forming intermetallic systems, addressing two unresolved challenges: (1) the relationship between amorphization efficiency and mechanical loading, and (2) energy absorption dynamics during crystal-to-amorphous (CTA) transitions. Our results demonstrate a decoupling between amorphization efficiency--governed by work rate and described by an effective temperature model--and energy absorption, which adheres to the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive relation. Crucially, the melting enthalpy emerges as a key determinant of the energy barrier, establishing a thermodynamic analogy between mechanical amorphization and thermally induced melting. This relationship provides a universally applicable metric to quantify amorphization kinetics. By unifying material properties and loading conditions, this work establishes a predictive framework for controlling amorphization processes. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of deformation-driven phase transitions and offer practical guidelines for designing materials with tailored properties for ultrafast fabrication, ball milling, and advanced mechanical processing techniques."

      "summary": "Molecules with an odd number of electrons typically display paramagnetic behaviour in a uniform magnetic field. Single-molecule toroics -- a family of open shell lanthanide complexes -- instead display an unprecedented vanishing magnetization. The anomaly is reconciled by degenerate quantum states where electron spins and orbital currents give rise to time-odd and space-odd magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments, that carry a vanishing magnetic dipole. Resilient to stray magnetic fields and susceptible to electric manipulation, toroidal moments have attracted interest for spintronic, magnonic, and photonic applications. While macroscopic toroidal moments feature in some extended systems, molecular toroidal states have yet to be observed, as it remains unclear how existing experimental set-ups could split degenerate states carrying counter-rotating vortices. We propose a realistic pulsed radiation protocol to polarise and observe molecular toroidal moments in a class of MDy$_6$ (M = Al$^{3+}$, Cr$^{3+}$) molecules with coupled Dy$_3$ toroidal moieties. Three resonant MW-pulses -- delivered sequentially or simultaneously -- selectively and coherently transfers population to a long-lived toroidally-polarised state whose ensuing magneto-electric properties provide a read-out mechanism. Our results provide a strategy to measure and coherently manipulate toroidal states in molecular systems, which is expected to trigger applications of molecular toroidal states to quantum technologies."

The Weyl-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction may be related to the magnetic orders observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals. Previous studies of RKKY interaction between magnetic impurities in Weyl semimetals found Heisenberg, Ising-like, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) types of interactions. However, different range functions are obtained in the literature. In this work, we calculate the Weyl-mediated RKKY interaction by using the divergence-free imaginary-time formalism and obtain exact analytical results at finite temperature. The discrepancies among zero temperature range functions in the literature are resolved. At nonzero temperature, the interaction strength decays exponentially in the long distance limit. But in the short distance limit, the DM interaction shows a thermal enhancement, an effect persists up to higher temperature for shorter distance. This provides a mechanism stabilizing the helical order observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals."

We present the Crystal Host-Guided Generation (CHGGen) framework to address this challenge through conditional generation using an inpainting method, which optimizes a fraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host structure to improve the success rate for symmetric structure generation. By integrating inpainting structure generation with a foundation potential for structure optimization, we demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical systems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric structures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen extends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures, particularly for systems with partial occupancy or intercalation chemistry. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other generative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials discovery."

Here we report a class of cross-chain electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $\\mathcal{O}$. Notably, the cross-chain electride characteristic in the $M_2$N monoalyers is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced and robust surface interstitial electronic state. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering another pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials."

By replacing the costly density functional theory (DFT) computation of phonon modes with much faster MLIP phonon mode calculations, our approach achieves speed improvements exceeding an order of magnitude with minimal precision loss. We benchmark the approach using a dataset comprising ab initio emission spectra of 791 color centers spanning various types of crystal point defects in different charge and magnetic states. The method is also applied to a molecular emitter adsorbed on a hexagonal boron nitride surface. Across all the systems, we find excellent agreement for both the Huang-Rhys factor and the PL lineshapes. This application of universal MLIPs bridges the gap between computational efficiency and spectroscopic fidelity, opening pathways to high-throughput screening of defect-engineered materials. Our work not only demonstrates accelerated calculation of PL spectra with DFT accuracy, but also makes such calculations tractable for more complex materials."

      "summary": "We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM), using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group. Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \\ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\\frac{\\log \\Lambda/T_K^{\\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\\log \\Lambda/T_K^{\\mathrm{FL}}} \\sim \\frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \\log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies."

      "summary": "An interesting question in physics is how the correlation energy of atoms evolves upon forming a solid. Here, we address this problem for a specific case of double-layer FeSe. We used many-body wavefunction-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to compute the correlation energies of double-layer FeSe with different geometrical configurations and compared them with those of isolated Fe and Se atoms. Variational and diffusion QMC calculations were carried out with Slater Jastrow trial wavefunctions employing two alternative forms for the homogeneous two-body pair correlation term. The ground-state energy was obtained in the thermodynamic limit using two types of trial wave functions of JDFT, in which only the Jastrow factor is optimized while the Slater determinant is derived from the local density approximation, and JSD, where both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized simultaneously. Our results indicate that the correlation energy of double layer FeSe at the thermodynamic limit is mainly determined by the atomic contributions, with the bonding between atoms playing a comparatively minor role in it. After optimizing the interlayer separation of double-layer FeSe under tensile strain, we analyze the correlation energy as a function of strain and separation. We found that with increasing tensile stretch and interlayer spacing, the correlation energy of double-layer FeSe stochastically approaches that of its constituent atomic fragments."

One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is to expose them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This \"noise-induced synchronization\" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' relative phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. First, although the relative phases of the two clocks varied erratically, we confirm that they became statistically independent of initial conditions and hence equivalent after a well-defined timescale. Second, we show that an agent can estimate an effective phase that closely agrees with the other's phase. Thus, synchronization is practically attainable beyond the regime of conventional noise-induced synchronization. We finally discuss how it might be used in living systems."

      "summary": "Nanostructured tungsten has been reported as a possible alternative plasma-facing material due to its potential ability to self-heal radiation-induced defects, a property that is attributed to its high density of grain boundaries (GB). Here, we study the initial stages of self-healing at tungsten interfaces with molecular dynamics simulations driven by a machine-learning interatomic potential tailored to one of the most common GBs found in experiments. Our model accurately reproduces the ab initio potential energy surface derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and outperforms previously reported empirical and machine learning interatomic potentials in predicting defect energetics. The simulations reveal low-temperature defect migration to GBs driven by rapid dumbbell-like ordering and subsequent accommodation along GB grooves. In contrast to empirical potentials, which predict unexpected GB degradation at high temperatures after defect migration, our model maintains stable GB motifs over the investigated temperature range. The temperature-dependent defect counts, evaluated using an Arrhenius-like fit, yield an average interstitial migration energy of 0.048 eV, in agreement with experiment. This work underscores the capabilities of ab initio machine learning simulations in accurately modeling defect-GB interactions and highlights their potential to contribute to the development of radiation tolerant materials."

      "summary": "In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220% to 40% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit."

      "summary": "We study the magnetic and electronic properties of Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$.We calculate the magnetic exchanges of Ni$_x$NbSe$_2$ ($x = 1/3, 1/4,$ and $1$) and find that the out-of-plane magnetic coupling depends on the Ni connectivity: it is ferromagnetic when Ni atoms stack on top of each other, and antiferromagnetic otherwise. Focusing on Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$, we identify a ground-state transition from a stripe antiferromagnetic phase with Kramers degeneracy to a ferromagnetic phase above a critical Coulomb interaction U$_C$. Spin--orbit coupling lowers U$_C$, aligns the easy axis along $z$, and stabilizes collinear AFM and FM states over the competing 120$^\\circ$ phase. Ni intercalation also strongly modifies the electronic structure, replacing the $\\Gamma$-point hole pocket of pristine NbSe$_2$ with an electron pocket and shifting the Van Hove singularity away from the Fermi level, thereby suppressing potential instabilities. Finally, we investigate the altermagnetic phase in the broader class T$_{0.25}$MX$_2$, finding that spin--orbit effects induce orbital antiferromagnetism with weak ferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism depending on the N\\'eel vector orientation. Our results demonstrate that Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$ provides a versatile platform to explore and tune multiple competing magnetic phases that lie close in energy."

Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Ghosh - Pan Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed."

      "summary": "Metallic kagome lattices are attracting significant attention as they provide a platform to explore the interplay between topology and magnetism. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) plays a key role in unraveling their electronic structure. However, the analysis is often challenging due to the presence of multiple bands near the Fermi level. Indeed, each orbital generates three bands in a kagome lattice due to its three sites motif, which soon becomes complicated if many orbitals are present. To address this complexity, using ARPES matrix elements can be highly beneficial. First, band symmetry can be determined through selection rules based on light polarization. We emphasize that, in kagome lattices, as in all multi-site lattices, symmetry of the Bloch state is not only determined by the orbital character but also by the relative phase between the three sublattices. Additionally, interference between the three sublattices leads to a strong modulation of ARPES intensity across neighboring Brillouin zones. We show how unfolded band calculations capture these modulations, helping with band identification. We apply these ideas to CoSn, whose simple structure retains the key features of a kagome lattice. Using polarization dependent ARPES in several Brillouin zones, we isolate the dispersion of each band and discuss novel correlation effects, selectively renormalizing the bands crossing the Fermi level and shifting the others."

By solving the Born-Oppenheimer equation for varying $s$-wave scattering lengths between the heavy and light atoms, we demonstrate for both bosonic and fermionic systems that the Efimov spectra and hence the three-body parameters are universal even with the dipole interaction comparable in strength to the van der Waals interaction. While the bosonic systems exhibit Efimov states only in the $M_z=0$ channel, the fermionic systems show a characteristic doublet of the Efimov states in the $M_z=0$ and $M_z = \\pm 1$ channels due to the interplay of finite angular momentum and the anisotropy of the dipole interaction. Both numerical results and analytical formula obtained with the first-order perturbation show that the ratio of the three-body parameters between these two fermionic channels exhibits universality, particularly well in the limit of large mass imbalance. Leveraging this universality, we provide quantitative predictions for the values and ratios of the three-body parameters for experimentally relevant Er-Li and Dy-Li isotopes."

Our non-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations, performed for lattices of up to 61 sites, reveal that TGQDs transition from metallic to insulating regimes as a function of site radius size, while retaining edge-polarized ground states at half-filling. Notably, edge depolarization occurs upon single-electron doping in both metallic and insulating phases, contrasting with the Nagaoka ferromagnetism observed in hexagonal armchair geometries."

Yet, surprisingly, a key signature of stable superconductivity, namely the positivity of the superfluid density, $n_s(T)$, has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we address this central issue by calculating $n_s(T)$, for a generic model two-dimensional PDW superconductor. We uncover a surprisingly large region of intrinsic instability, associated with negative $n_s(T)$, revealing that a significant portion of the parameter space thought to be physical cannot support superconducting order. This instability is driven by the large pairing momentum required to form the PDW state. In the remaining stable regime, we predict two striking and observable fingerprints: an anomalously small longitudinal superfluid response that is vulnerable to thermal fluctuations, and an unusual temperature dependence for $n_s(T)$ arising from the unique gapless excitation spectrum of the PDW state. These generally model independent, as well as experimentally relevant findings suggest that the fragility of the superfluid density poses a significant problem for the formation of stable, finite temperature PDW superconductivity."

In particular, integrating ferroelectricity with altermagnetism to enable magnetoelectric coupling and electric control of spin has drawn significant attention.

Here, by focusing on molecular ferroelectrics, the first discovered ferroelectrics renowned for their highly controllable molecular polarizations and structural flexibility, we reveal that these obstacles can be removed by an emergent multiferroic altermagnets with tunable spin polarization in a large class of fabricated organic materials. Using a symmetry-based design and a tight-binding model, we uncover the underlying mechanism of such molecular ferroelectric altermagnets and demonstrate how noncollinear molecular polarization can switch the spin polarization on and off and even reverse its sign. From the first-principles calculations, we verify the feasibility of these materials in a series of well-established hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and metal-organic frameworks. Our findings bridge molecular ferroelectrics and altermagnetic spintronics, highlighting an unexplored potential of multifunctional organic multiferroics."

We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization.

It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems."

However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\\mathbf{K}/\\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\\sim$100\\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales.

      "summary": "Phase separation driven by nonequilibrium fluctuations is a hallmark of both living and synthetic active matter. Unlike equilibrium systems, where ordered states arise from the minimization of free energy, active systems are fueled by a constant injection of energy at the microscopic scale. The emergence of ordered phases in such driven systems challenges our conventional views of domain growth and interfacial structure. In this study, we investigate the coarsening of colloidal clusters in active liquids containing E. coli. Our experiments reveal that uniform dispersions of colloids and swimmers are inherently unstable, resulting in spontaneous phase separation characterized by fractal interfaces and unconventional kinetics. The correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamical scaling, with the size of colloidal domains growing as $t^{1/z}$, where $z \\sim 4$, in contrast to the well-known growth laws for thermal systems with a conserved order parameter. Furthermore, the structure factor exhibits non-Porod behavior, indicating domains with fractal interfaces. This non-Porod behavior also manifests itself as a cusp singularity in the correlation function. We elucidate our experimental findings using a scalar field theory in which the nonequilibrium fluctuations arising from swimmer activity are modeled as spatio-temporally correlated noise. This coarse-grained model, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and detailed balance, successfully reproduces key experimental observations. Furthermore, it reveals a fluctuating microphase separation, where the initial domain growth, following $t^{1/4}$ scaling, is eventually arrested, thereby shedding new light on the microscopic origins of unconventional phase separation of colloids in active liquids."

The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the adiponitrile-LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and 'well-diffusive' in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (~1M) than in saturated LiPF6-Adpn solutions (0.04M), and ions predominantly solvated by -CN groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs."

      "summary": "We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

      "summary": "We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$. We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Its mean field yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experiments. Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals."

      "summary": "Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled."

      "summary": "When a less viscous Newtonian fluid displaces an aging aqueous clay suspension in a confined space, a rich array of interfacial patterns emerges due to a predominantly viscous instability. In the present work, we controlled the mechanical properties of clay suspensions by incorporating additives and studied the interfacial instabilities that resulted when these suspensions were radially displaced by water in a Hele-Shaw cell. When the elasticity of clay was low, the interfacial dynamics exhibited features of nonlinear viscous fingering in heterogeneous media. By tuning the nature and content of additives that delay clay aging, we uncovered two novel propagation mechanisms: pattern growth \\textit{via} skewering and zig-zag finger propagation. These patterns have hitherto never been observed in experiments with colloidal systems. For moderate clay elasticities, we demonstrate here that shear-thinning-induced flow anisotropy leads to the formation of dendrites with dominant side branches. As clay elasticity increases due to the incorporation of salts, the energy required to create fractures becomes smaller than that for system-wide yielding. This scenario is characterized by the emergence of viscoelastic fractures. Our work demonstrates that incorporating additives is an effective strategy to manipulate the onset and growth of interfacial instabilities during the confined displacement of clay by miscible Newtonian fluids."

      "summary": "Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces."

The underlying mechanism for this emergence is analogous to self-organized criticality. Based on this understanding, we introduce four non-equilibrium models that consistently demonstrate hyperuniformity. Furthermore, we show that systems with an arbitrary number of conserved mass multipole moments exhibit an arbitrary strong tunable hyperuniform scaling, with the structure factor following $S(k) \\sim k^m$, where $m$ is set by the number of conserved multipoles. Finally, we find that hyperuniformity arising from a combination of conserved noise and partially conserved average motion is not robust against non-linear perturbations. These results highlight the central role of conservation laws in stabilizing hyperuniformity and reveal a unifying mechanism for its emergence in non-equilibrium systems."

      "summary": "Spin-wave-based computing has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the fundamental limitations of CMOS technologies. However, the increasing demand for device miniaturization down to a 100 nm scale presents significant challenges for long-distance spin-wave transport. Gallium-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Ga:YIG) offers a potential solution to these challenges due to its unique magnetic properties. The reduced saturation magnetization in Ga:YIG enables efficient excitation of exchange-dominated spin waves, which exhibit enhanced transport characteristics compared to dipolar-dominated modes in conventional materials. Here, we present the first comprehensive study combining experimental, analytical, and numerical investigations of spin-wave propagation in Ga:YIG waveguides down to 145 nm width and 73 nm thickness. Using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, TetraX simulations, and analytical dispersion calculations, we demonstrate that Ga:YIG waveguides support spin waves with significantly higher group velocities up to 600 m/s. This value remains constant for structures with different widths, leading to longer spin-wave propagation lengths in nanowaveguides compared to non-substituted YIG. These results reveal that gallium substitution provides access to faster and longer-lived spin waves, opening new possibilities for implementing this material in nanoscale magnonic devices."

Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems."

In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light-matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above-bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes has been experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion has been limited to perturbative levels. Here, this challenge is overcome by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid-infrared pulses, ferroelectric reversal is induced in lithium niobate, and the large-amplitude mode displacements are characterized through femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation. This approach, validated by first-principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast speeds."

In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The mutual information has been extensively applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information to arbitrary order in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single bins. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates."

In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual spider monkey core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. Sets of individuals with complementary overlaps are identified, showing a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions, and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments."

High-resolution PiF contrasts obtained by merging subsequent PiF-IR scans at two different illumination frequencies revealed chemical details of cell wall destruction after 30 and 60 min incubation with vancomycin with a spatial resolution of $\\approx 5$ nm. This approach compensates local intensity variations induced by near-field coupling of the illuminating electric field with nanostructured surfaces, which appear in single-frequency contrasts in photothermal imaging methods, as shown by [Anindo et al., J. Phys. Chem C, 2025, 129, 4517]. Known spectral shifts associated with hydrogen bond formation between vancomycin and the N-acyl-D-Ala4-D-Ala5 termini in the peptidoglycan cell wall have been observed in chemometrics of PiF-IR spectra from treated and untreated Bacillus subtilis harvested after 30 min from the same experiment. Spectral signatures of the vancomyin interaction have been located in the piecrust of a progressing septum with $\\approx 10$ nm resolution using PiF contrasts of three selected bands of a PiF-IR hyperspectral scan of an individual Bacillus subtilis cell harvested after 30 min incubation. Our results are complemented by a discussion of imaging artifacts and the influence of parameter settings supporting further development towards standardization in the application of PiF-IR for visualizing the chemical interaction of antibiotics on the surface of microbes with few nanometer resolution."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Phase separation of biomolecular condensates promotes membrane-free compartmentalization in cells. The dynamics of these biocondensates is routinely regulated by energy-consuming processes. Here, we devise a theory pinpointing how active chemical reactions, interconverting molecules between phase-separating and inert forms, can drive faster condensate coarsening. We find that mass conservation limits droplet volume growth to being linear in time regardless of activity, resembling the passive Lifshitz-Slyozov law. However, if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts, e.g., as a regulator of metabolic channeling."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling dynamics such as in random unitary circuits. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a \"non-demolition\" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of \"ergodic\" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases, measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time, whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer R\\'enyi Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain quantum computational resources."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The growing demand for photovoltaic (PV) technologies that are lightweight, flexible, and seamlessly integrated into diverse applications has propelled interest in thin-film solar cells. Among these, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) and metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention in the past and present, respectively. While CIGS reached commercial readiness after decades of refinement, their large-scale deployment was hindered by manufacturing complexity, scale-up challenges, and a lack of coordination between materials, device design, and production systems. Perovskite solar cells, despite setting record efficiencies at an unprecedented pace, now face similar challenges on their path to commercialization: ensuring long-term stability, translating laboratory performance to scalable architectures, and aligning with industrial realities. In this perspective, we revisit the CIGS experience not as a benchmark, but as a blueprint, highlighting how its successes and failures can inform a more deliberate and durable trajectory for perovskite PV. Bridging this historical perspective with the current frontier, we propose that the future of perovskites depends not only on continued innovation, but on learning from past thin-film PV experience to avoid its repetition."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics."

One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\\\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \\textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \\textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\\delta$ in the system-state with $\\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\\delta)^{o(1)})$ gates, $\\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\\delta)^{o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\\delta)^{o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates."
