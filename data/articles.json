Nevertheless, disorder scatters the charge and spin properties of the qubits within a quantum chip, which poses a challenge for scaling up. The accurate assessment of variability is crucial for establishing reliable roadmaps toward large-scale spin-qubit quantum computers. This study uses numerical simulations to quantify the expected variability of hole-spin qubits in realistic Ge devices, focusing on charge traps at interfaces. It turns out that charge properties don’t vary so much, but spin properties do. [Phys. Rev. Applied 25, 014018] Published Thu Jan 08, 2026"
