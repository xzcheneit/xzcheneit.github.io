      "summary": "We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from R\\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals."

      "summary": "Multilayer graphene materials have recently emerged as a fascinating versatile platform for correlated electron phenomena, hosting superconductivity, fractional quantum Hall states, and correlated insulating phases. A particularly striking experimental observation is the recurring correlation between nematicity in the normal state -- manifested by spontaneous breaking of the underlying $C_3$ symmetry -- and the stabilization of robust superconducting phases. Despite its ubiquity across different materials, devices and experiments, this trend has thus far lacked a clear microscopic explanation. In this work, we identify a concrete mechanism linking nematic order to enhanced superconductivity. We demonstrate that $C_3$-symmetry breaking strongly reshapes the Bloch wavefunctions near the Fermi level, producing a pronounced enhancement and redistribution of the so-called quantum metric. This effect drastically amplifies superconducting pairing mediated by the quantum geometric Kohn-Luttinger mechanism [G. Shavit \\it{et al.}, \\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.176001}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 176001 (2025)}]. Our analysis reveals that nematicity naturally boosts the superconducting coupling constant in experimentally relevant density regimes, providing a compelling explanation for observed correlations. These results establish the central role of geometric effects in graphene superconductivity and highlight nematicity as a promising avenue for engineering stronger unconventional superconducting states."

      "summary": "Thermalization in isolated quantum systems is governed by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, while strong disorder can induce its breakdown via many-body localization. Here we show that disorder can also generate a narrow band of thermal eigenstates embedded in an otherwise non-thermal spectrum. We illustrate this generic mechanism using paradigmatic spin-1 models, including Heisenberg, XY, and Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models with several types of disorder. By analyzing their level statistics, entanglement properties and quench dynamics, we show that the disorder-induced states are genuinely thermal and we trace their origin to the null space of the disorder term in the Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate that disorder can give rise to an unexpected coexistence of thermal and non-thermal dynamics within the same many-body spectrum."

      "summary": "Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity in a non-ferroelectric polar material such as AlN or ZnO that are typically unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown field. When placed in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric layer (such as Al1-xScxN or Zn1-xMgxO), they become a practically switchable ferroelectric. Using the thermodynamic Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, in this work we performed the finite element modeling of the polarization switching in the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN, ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO and MgO-Zn1-xMgxO structures sandwiched in both a parallel-plate capacitor geometry as well as in a sharp probe-planar electrode geometry. We reveal that the compositionally graded structure allows the simultaneous switching of spontaneous polarization in the whole system by a coercive field significantly lower than the electric breakdown field of unswitchable polar materials. The physical mechanism is the depolarization electric field determined by the gradient of chemical composition \"x\". The field lowers the steepness of the switching barrier in the otherwise unswitchable parts of the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN and ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO structures, while it induces a shallow double-well free energy potential in the MgO-like regions of compositionally graded MgO-Zn1-xMgxO structure. Proximity ferroelectric switching of the compositionally graded structures placed in the probe-electrode geometry occurs due to nanodomain formation under the tip. We predict that a gradient of chemical composition \"x\" significantly lowers effective coercive fields of the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN and ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO structures compared to the coercive fields of the corresponding multilayers with a uniform chemical composition in each layer."

      "summary": "Conventional topological Hall effects (THE) require conducting magnets, leaving insulating systems largely inaccessible. Here we introduce the interfacial topological Hall effect (ITHE), where the noncoplanar spin textures of insulating magnets are imprinted onto an adjacent heavy metal via the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) and detected electrically. In Pt/h-LuFeO3 bilayers, h-LuFeO3 hosts a topological spin structure robust against high magnetic fields, arising from a 120{\\deg} triangular spin lattice with small spin canting that yields nontrivial topology but minimal magnetization. This generates a giant Hall response in Pt up to 0.5% of the longitudinal resistivity and a Hall-conductivity/magnetization ratio above 2 V^{-1}, clearly distinguishable from the spin Hall Hanle effect background. Field- and temperature-dependent analysis further reveals that Pt nanoclusters inherit topological textures from h-LuFeO3 via MPE. Unlike the conventional THE narrow peak-and-dip features, ITHE in Pt/h-LuFeO3 persists across a broad magnetic field range up to 14 T, demonstrating the exceptional stability of the underlying topological spin structure. This establishes ITHE as a powerful and sensitive probe for topological magnetism in ultrathin insulating films and paves the way for new spintronic applications."

Theoretically, mechanisms based on the intrinsic Berry phase and those on extrinsic impurity-induced scatterings have been proposed, which can be distinguished by comparing the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall effect and that of the magnetic anisotropy. Here, we investigate the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall effects in the antiferromagnet Na2Co2TeO6 and its non-magnetic isostructural analogue Na2Zn2TeO6 in the ac plane. We find that the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity in both materials well follows that of the out-of-plane magnetization, showing a common mechanism by extrinsic impurity-induced scatterings in both the phonon thermal Hall effect and that enhanced by a coupling with the magnetism."

      "summary": "We review two magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) approaches for compact, low-power, CMOS-integrated true random number generation (TRNG). The first employs passive-read, easy-plane superparamagnetic MTJs (sMTJs) that generate thermal-fluctuation-driven bit streams at $0.5$--$1$~Gb/s per device. The second uses MTJs with magnetically stable free layers, operated with stochastic write pulses to achieve switching probabilities of about $0.5$ (\\emph{i.e.}, write error rates of $\\simeq 0.5$), achieving $\\gtrsim 0.1$~Gb/s per device; we refer to these as stochastic-write MTJs (SW-MTJs). Randomness from both approaches has been validated using the NIST~SP800 test suites. The sMTJ approach uses a read-only cell with low power and can be compatible with most advanced CMOS nodes, while SW-MTJs leverage standard CMOS MTJ process flows, enabling co-integration with embedded spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM). Both approaches can achieve deep sub-0.01~$\\mu$m$^2$ MTJ footprints and offer orders-of-magnitude better energy efficiency than CPU/GPU-based generators, enabling placement near logic for high-throughput random bit-streams for probabilistic computing, statistical modeling, and cryptography. In terms of performance, sMTJs generally suit applications requiring very high data-rate random bits near logic processors, such as probabilistic computing or large-scale statistical modeling. By contrast, SW-MTJs are an attractive option for edge-oriented microcontrollers, providing entropy sources for computing or cryptographic enhancement. We highlight the strengths, limitations, and integration challenges of each approach, emphasizing the need to reduce device-to-device variability in sMTJs -- particularly by mitigating magnetostriction-induced in-plane anisotropy -- and to improve temporal stability in SW-MTJs for robust, large-scale deployment."

      "summary": "Understanding the moisture stability of oxide Li-ion conductors is important for their practical applications in solid-state batteries. Unlike sulfide or halide conductors, oxide conductors generally better resist degradation when in contact with water, but can still undergo topotactic ion exchange between Li ions within the structure and protons in the environment. In this work, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a machine-learning interatomic potential model to investigate the thermodynamic driving force of the Li+/H+ exchange reaction for two representative oxide Li-ion conductor families: garnets and NASICONs. Our results indicate that the high Li chemical potential in Li-stuffed garnets is responsible for the stronger driving force for exchanging Li with protons as compared to the Li-unstuffed structures. In contrast, NASICONs demonstrate a higher resistance against proton exchange, which is attributed to the lower Li chemical potential and the lower O-H bond covalency for polyanion-bonded oxygens. Our findings highlight the trade-off when using Li stuffing as a mechanism to enhance Li-ion conductivity, as it also promotes degradation by moisture. This study underscores the importance of designing Li-ion conductors that not only possess high conductivity, but also exhibit high stability in practical environments."

      "summary": "The growing need for structural materials with strength, mechanical stability, and durability in extreme environments is driving the development of high entropy alloys. These are materials with near equiatomic mixing of five or more principal elements, and such compositional complexity often leads to improvements in mechanical properties and high thermal stability, etc. Thus, high-entropy alloys have found their applications in domains like aerospace, biomedical, energy storage, catalysis, electronics, etc. However, the vast compositional design and experimental exploration of high-entropy alloys are both time consuming and expensive and require a large number of resources. Machine learning techniques have thus become essential for accelerating high entropy alloys discovery using data driven predictions of promising alloy combinations and their properties. Hence, this work employs a machine learning framework that predicts high entropy alloy hardness from elemental descriptors such as atomic radius, valence electron count, bond strength, etc. Machine learning regression models, like LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Transformer encoder, were trained on experimental data. Additionally, a language model was also fine tuned to predict hardness from elemental descriptor strings. The results indicate that LightGBM has better accuracy in predicting the hardness of high entropy alloys compared to other models used in this study. Further, a combinatorial technique was used to generate over 9 million virtual high entropy alloy candidates, and the trained machine learning models were used to predict their hardness. This study shows how machine learning-driven high throughput screening and language modelling approaches can accelerate the development of next generation high entropy alloys."

Coulomb interactions and valley mixing effects are treated within the same microscopic framework, allowing us to systematically investigate spin and valley polarization transitions as functions of interaction strength and external tuning parameters. We calculate the low energy states for single and double QDs as a function of the number of electrons, identifying regimes of highly correlated multi-electron states. We confirm the presence of a spin-one ground state for two electrons. Then, we explore two coupled QDs with 4 electrons and extend the analysis to QD arrays. Using a mapping of the BLGQD chain to an effective bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ) spin model, we demonstrate that BLGQD arrays can work as a quantum simulator for one-dimensional spin chains with emergent many-body topological phases."

The probability of such giant avalanches demonstrates two distinct regimes as a function of $R$: for sufficiently small $R$, it increases monotonically, whereas for large $R$ it undergoes threshold dynamics, so that at certain values of $R$, the percolation probability exhibits abrupt jumps. We refer it to as \\textit{pseudo-percolation transitions}, based on which we propose a hierarchical percolation model at the mean-field level: each percolation transition corresponds to percolation within a disc of radius $R$. We further examine both local and global geometrical observables. The local quantities include avalanche size, mass, and duration and sub-avalanche mass, while for the global characterization we analyze the loop length and gyration radius of the external perimeter, as well as the mass of sub-avalanches. Remarkably, all these observables exhibit power-law scaling for all values of $R$, with exponents that vary systematically with $R$. Notably, in the vicinity of the pseudo-percolation transition points, the exponents approach characteristic values, signaling a distinct critical behavior."

      "summary": "Magnetic toroidal order features a loop-like arrangement of magnetic dipole moments, thus breaking both spatial inversion (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries while preserving their combined PT sym-metry. This PT symmetry enables a linear magnetoelectric effect, allowing the coupling between magnetic toroidicity and electric polarity. However, the detection and control of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic toroidal order and the investigation of its linear magnetoelectric response remain largely unexplored. Here, using bilayer CrSBr as a platform, which hosts an in-plane layer-antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and simultaneously exhibits a magnetic toroidal order, we show compelling evidence for tuning this 2D magnetic toroidicity and its induced electric polarity through magnetic-field-depend-ent second harmonic generation (SHG). Under an out-of-plane magnetic field, we decompose the SHG signal into a time-reversal-odd component that scales with the magnetic toroidal moment and a time-reversal-even component that is proportional to the electric polarization. When sweeping the magnetic field from positive to negative values, we observe that the magnetic toroidicity retains its sign but diminishes in magnitude at higher fields while the electric polarity flips its sign and increases in strength at increasing fields below a critical threshold. When applying an in-plane electric field along the N\\'eel vector direction, together with an out-of-plane field, we find that the magnetic toroidal and electric polar domains are moved in a locked fashion. These findings underscore the promise of 2D magnetic toroidal order in realizing giant linear magnetoelectric effects, opening exciting possi-bilities for next-generation electronic, magnetic, optical, and photonic devices enabled by 2D mag-netoelectrics."

      "summary": "Altermagnets have recently been recognized as a distinct class of magnetic materials characterized by alternative spin-split electronic structures without net magnetization. Despite intensive studies on their single-particle spintronic and valleytronic properties, many-electron interactions and optical responses of altermagnets remain less explored. In this work, we employ many-body perturbation theory to investigate excited states and their strain tunability. Using monolayer Mn2WS4 as a representative candidate, we uncover a novel spin valley-dependent excitonic selection rule in two-dimensional altermagnetic Lieb lattices. In addition to strongly bound excitons, we find that linearly polarized light selectively excites valley spin-polarized excitons. Moreover, due to the interplay between altermagnetic spin symmetry and electronic orbital character, we predict that applying uniaxial strain can lift valley degeneracy and enable the selective excitation of spin-polarized excitons, an effect not achievable in previously studied transition-metal dichalcogenides. These spin-valley-locked excitonic states and their strain tunability offer a robust mechanism for four-fold symmetric altermagnets to encode, store, and read valley/spin information."

      "summary": "We predict a so-called axial Hall effect, a Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall response, in Lieb-lattice altermagnets. By constructing a tight-binding model, we identify the axial direction as a hidden topological degree of freedom. Breaking the double degeneracy of axial symmetry generates substantial Berry curvature and induces a pronounced anomalous Hall conductivity. First-principles calculations further confirm the emergence of this effect in strained altermagnets, particularly in ternary transition-metal dichalcogenides. We take Mn2WS4 as an example to reveal that the axial Hall effect originates from the interplay between Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and the intrinsic piezomagnetic response of Lieb-lattice altermagnets, leading to highly localized and enhanced Berry curvature. Remarkably, the magnitude of the axial Hall effect is significant and remains unchanged when varying the strain, highlighting the topological nature of the axial degree of freedom. Finally, in multilayer systems, the effect manifests as a distinctive thickness-dependent modulation of both anomalous and spin Hall responses. These findings emphasize the critical role of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear spin textures in altermagnets, an area that has received limited attention, and open new pathways for exploring intrinsic Hall phenomena in topological magnetic systems."

We use time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau to extend the theory of hydride dissipation to sub-surface hydrides. Just as surface hydrides cause Q-disease behavior, we show that sub-surface hydrides cause high-field Q-slope (HFQS) behavior. We find that the abrupt onset of HFQS is due to a transition from a vortex-free state to a vortex-penetration state. We show that controlling hydride size and depth through impurity doping can eliminate HFQS."

To this end, we investigate the spin susceptibility within the random phase approximation, considering the onsite Coulomb interaction. We demonstrate that spin susceptibility can be decomposed into a trivial part, dependent solely on the band dispersion, and a geometric part, where the quantum distance plays a crucial role. Focusing on a model of a quadratic band-touching semimetal, we show that a magnetic phase transition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order can be induced solely by tuning the wavefunction geometry, even while the energy spectrum is held constant. This highlights the versatility of quantum geometry as a mechanism for tuning magnetic properties independent of the energy spectrum. Applying our framework to the Fe-pnictide and kagome lattice models, we further show that the geometric contribution is decisive in stabilizing their known antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, respectively. Our work sheds light on the hidden quantum geometric aspects necessary for understanding and engineering magnetic order in quantum materials."

      "summary": "Electric field control of electron charge and spin degrees of freedom is fundamental to modern semiconductor and spintronic devices. Yet controlling electromagnetic waves with an electric field, particularly in the terahertz (THz) band, remains a challenge. Here, we propose a spin-corner-layer coupling (SCLC) mechanism in second-order topological altermagnetic bilayers. By using an electric field to influence electrons between different layers, the SCLC mechanism enables simultaneous control over corner and spin degrees of freedom, thereby allowing electric-field tuning of the absorption, emission intensity, and even polarization of THz waves. Taking bilayer NiZrI$_6$ nanodisks as a prototype, we demonstrate that an ultralow electrostatic field can switch both the spin and the layer polarizations of corner states. This dual switching modulates transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths between different corner states, thereby enabling the manipulation of THz waves. This study establishes a mechanism for the electric-field control of spin and THz waves through SCLC, yielding important implications for the advancement of THz spintronics."

While their bulk and nanostructured forms have been studied extensively, controlled synthesis of single-crystalline mesoscale samples suitable for device fabrication has remained limited. Here, we report a solid-liquid-solid (SLS) growth strategy that yields high-quality K$_x$WO$_3$ nanobelts with thicknesses down to ~36 nm and lateral sizes exceeding 100 um. The crystals display sharp optical domains arising from local variations in potassium occupancy, as confirmed by spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy and electron diffraction. Under applied bias, these domains vanish irreversibly, consistent with lateral redistribution of K+ ions along the tunnels. Two-terminal devices fabricated from individual nanobelts exhibit reproducible bipolar switching with resistance ratios of 10-30, characteristic short-term and long-term plasticity under pulsed excitation, and switching energies of ~25 nJ. These results establish K$_x$WO$_3$ as a model tunnel-structured oxide for studying electric-field-driven alkali-ion migration, while also highlighting its potential for stable, analog resistive switching and iontronic memory applications."

      "summary": "Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) have garnered global research interest owing to their superior photovoltaic (PV) performance. The future of photovoltaic technology lies in PSCs since they can produce power with performance on par with the best silicon solar cells while being less expensive. PSCs have enormous potential; in just ten years, their efficiency increased from 3.8% to 25.2%, and research into new developments is still ongoing. Thermal instability is PSCs' main disadvantage, despite their high efficiency, flexibility, and lightweight nature. This paper looks at how temperature affects the ways that hole transport layers (HTLs) like spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite layers, especially MAPbI3, degrade. Elevated temperatures cause MAPbI3 to degrade into PbI2, CH3I, and NH3, with decomposition rates affected by moisture, oxygen, and environmental factors. Mixed cation compositions, such as Cs-MA-FA, have higher thermal stability, whereas MA+ cations break-down faster under heat stress. HTLs deteriorate due to morphological changes and the hydrophilicity of dopant additions like Li-TFSI and t-BP. Alternative dopant-free HTMs, such as P3HT and inorganic materials including CuSCN, NiOx, and Cu2O, have shown improved thermal stability and efficiency. Hybrid HTLs, dopant-free designs, and interface tweaks are all viable solutions for increasing the stability of PSC. Addressing thermal stability issues remains crucial for the development of more reliable and efficient PSC technology."

      "summary": "In the past fifteen years, flow instabilities reminiscent of the Taylor-like instabilities driven by hoop stresses, have been observed in wormlike micelles based on surfactant molecules. In particular, purely elastic instabilities and turbulence have been shown to develop on top of shear banding, a type of flow specific to the semi-dilute and concentrated regimes. These instabilities have been identified as the origin of the large body of data showing complex spatio-temporal fluctuations, collected in shear-banded systems using multiple experimental techniques. Different categories of banding have been suggested depending on their stability, which involve intrinsic properties of the system and streamline curvature. It has been shown qualitatively that instabilities are promoted by an increase of the surfactant concentration or of the curvature of the flow geometry, while an increase in temperature stabilizes the flow. Here, using benchmark shear banding micellar systems, we quantify, for the first time, the effect of the streamline curvature on these flow instabilities, focusing more specifically on the transition towards purely elastic turbulence. Using various optical visualizations, we identify two transitional pathways to elastic turbulence. We construct a generic state diagram in a parameter space based on the curvature ratio and the Weissenberg number. The nature -- supercritical \\textit{vs} subcritical -- of the transition to elastic turbulence is discussed. The stress evolution is in favor of a change of nature from subcritical to supercritical transition as the curvature ratio increases. However we show that finite size effects cannot be neglected and may smooth artificially the stress response. Furthermore, each domain of this diagram is characterized using velocimetry measurements. Finally a scaling for the onset of elastic turbulence is determined."

The inclusion of such processes is crucial for providing reliable models for the development and verification of APT reconstruction algorithms, a key part of the whole methodology. Here we include stochastic lateral velocity perturbations and a roll-up mechanism to simulations performed using the Robin--Rolland model. By comparing with experimental data from Al and Ni systems, we find the stochastic perturbation energy distributions that allow us to very accurately reproduce the detector patterns seen experimentally and thus greatly improve the accuracy of the simulations. We also explore the possible causes of remaining discrepancies between the experimental and simulated detector patterns."

      "summary": "The spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice(PAFH) is arguably the most well known strongly frustrated quantum magnet in three spatial dimension. As a close analogy of its two dimensional cousin, namely the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice(KAFH), it has long been anticipated that the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH may host a novel quantum spin liquid. However, due to the rapid scaling of Hilbert space with the linear size of such a three dimensional system, study of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH is limited to rather small clusters and the nature of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed powerful algorithm to perform large scale unrestricted variational optimization of the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH. We find that the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH features a maximally resonating valence bond crystal(VBC) pattern with $2\\times2\\times2$ periodicity. There are at least four levels of hierarchical structure in such a VBC state, with the first and the second level of hierarchy related to the breaking of the inversion and the translational symmetry. We also find that an nearest-neighboring(NN)-RVB ansatz with $2\\times 2\\times 2$ periodicity can capture very well the qualitative feature of the maximally resonating VBC state. The ground state energy obtained from the NN-RVB ansatz and the generalized RVB ansatz extrapolate to $-0.4827J/site$ and $-0.4835J/site$ respectively in the thermodynamic limit. These results, which are obtained on clusters containing as many as $N=8^{3}\\times4=2048$ sites and wave function containing as many as $N_{v}=16777216$ variational parameters, constitute new benchmarks for the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH."

Yet, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ($\\kappa$) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs) including recently developed foundation models. %MACE-OMAT-0, UMA, and NEP89. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and \\textsc{HIPHIVE} against density functional theory (DFT) and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on $\\kappa$. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials."

      "summary": "We investigate the dynamics of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling numerically and analytically. Under the drive of a weak segmented rotational external field, we observe that the system exhibits cyclic soliton motion; however, in contrast to the predictions of quasi-particle theory, the trajectory of the soliton center shows a distinct drift. The underlying mechanism of this anomalous drift is revealed: the moving soliton experiences a Lorentz force induced by a virtual magnetic monopole field in momentum space. We further calculate the phase evolution of the soliton during this cyclic motion and find that its geometric component comprises both an adiabatic Berry phase and a nonadiabatic Aharonov-Anandan phase. Notably, the Berry phase can be expressed in terms of the magnetic flux of the aforementioned virtual monopole field. Our findings hold implications for geometric phase theory and experiments on two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and may establish a novel link between quantum geometry and soliton dynamics."

      "summary": "Recent experiments have observed superconductivity up to 48 K in La3Ni2O7-derived films under compressive strain imposed by the SrLaAlO4 substrate, while such films on the SrTiO3 substrate with tensile strain have failed to reach the superconducting state. Here we propose to broadly expand the choices of materials platforms to achieve high-Tc superconducting La3Ni2O7 films by proposing designer substrates of Ba1-xSrxO (x = 0 - 1) that allow to continuously tune the strain in the films from being tensile to compressive. Our systematic study of the structural and electronic reconstructions of the strained La3Ni2O7 bilayer film leads to the central finding that at the optimal tensile strain of ~2% (x ~0.25), the spectral weight of the Ni dz2 orbital is peaked right at the Fermi level, and its hybridization with the Ni dx2-y2 orbital is substantially enhanced. Consequently, the expected Tc should be unprecedentedly high, at least substantially higher than those achieved in the compressive regime. Furthermore, our detailed thickness-dependent energetic analyses show that such films can be stably grown for thicknesses equal to or beyond the bilayer regime, and predict that the SrO-terminated SrTiO3 should also be able to stabilize the films with optimal tensile strain and higher Tc's."

      "summary": "We present a first-principles study of the contrasting easy magnetization axes(EMAs) in the layered chromium trihalides CrCl3 and CrBr3, which exhibit in-plane and out-of-plane EMAs, respectively. Using density-functional theory calculations, we show that the EMA is determined by the interplay between spin-orbit coupling-induced magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (SOC-MAE) and shape magnetic anisotropy energy(shape-MAE) arising from dipole-dipole interactions. While the Cr d orbitals contribute similarly to the SOC-MAE in both compounds, the key difference stems from the halogen p orbitals. In CrCl3, the localized Cl 3p orbitals favor spin-flip SOC interactions, particularly between the (px, py) and (py, pz) channels. These channels contribute with opposite signs-negative and positive, respectively-leading to partial cancellation and a small net SOC-MAE. As a result, the shape-MAE exceeds the SOC-MAE in magnitude, favoring an in-plane EMA. In contrast, CrBr3 features more delocalized Br 4p orbitals, enhanced p-d hybridization, and stronger SOC. This leads to stronger spin-conserving SOC interactions, with dominant contributions from both the (px, py) and (py, pz) channels. In this case, the positive contribution from the (px, py) channel outweighs the smaller negative contribution from the (py, pz) channel, resulting in a sizable net SOC-MAE. The SOC-MAE thus surpasses the shape-MAE and stabilizes an out-of-plane EMA. These findings demonstrate that the contrasting magnetic anisotropies in CrCl3 and CrBr3 originate from differences in the spatial distribution, SOC strength, and hybridization of the halogen p orbitals, highlighting the critical role of orbital anisotropy and spin selection rules in governing magnetic behavior in layered semiconductors."

      "summary": "Accurate prediction of excited states in battery electrolytes is central to understanding photostability, oxidative stability, and degradation. We employ hybrid quantum-classical algorithms -- the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for ground states combined with the quantum equation of motion (qEOM) for vertical singlet excitations -- to study LiPF$_6$, NaPF$_6$, LiFSI, and NaFSI. Compact active spaces were constructed from frontier orbitals, mapped to qubits, and reduced via symmetry tapering and commuting-group measurements to lower sampling cost. Within $\\sim$10-qubit models, VQE-qEOM agrees closely with exact diagonalization of the same Hamiltonians, while sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) in larger active spaces recovers near-exact (subspace-FCI) energies. The spectra display clear anion and cation trends: PF$_6$ salts exhibit higher first-excitation energies (e.g., LiPF$_6$ $\\approx$13.2 eV) and a compact three-state cluster at 12-13 eV, whereas FSI salts show substantially lower onsets ($\\approx$8-9 eV) with a near-degenerate (S$_1$,S$_2$) followed by S$_3$ $\\sim$1.3 eV higher. Substituting Li$^+$ with Na$^+$ narrows the gap by $\\sim$0.4-0.8 eV within each anion family. Converting S$_1$ to wavelengths places the onsets in the deep-UV (LiPF$_6$ $\\sim$94 nm; NaPF$_6$ $\\sim$100 nm; LiFSI $\\sim$141 nm; NaFSI $\\sim$148 nm). All results pertain to isolated species or embedded clusters appropriate to the NISQ regime; solvent shifts can be incorporated a posteriori via classical $\\Delta$-solvation or static embedding. These results demonstrate that current quantum algorithms can deliver chemically meaningful excitation and binding trends for realistic electrolyte motifs and provide quantitative baselines to guide electrolyte screening and design."

      "summary": "Due to the rapid development of micro- and nano-manufacturing and electronic devices, heat transfer at the transition regime between radiation and conduction becomes increasingly important. Recent work has demonstrated the importance of nonlocal optical response and phonon tunneling. However, it remains unclear how the crystal orientation impacts them. In this work, we study this effect on heat transport across vacuum gaps between magnesium oxide (MgO) by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. At 5~\\AA~gaps, the overall thermal conductance exhibits 30\\% enhancement for [100] orientation versus [110] and [210], while becoming orientation-insensitive beyond 6~\\AA. When the gap size is extremely small, the crystal orientation significantly impacts the resonance frequencies of spectral thermal conductance which are quite close to those of unique surface phonon modes distinct from bulk counterparts. As the gap size gradually increases, the spectral thermal conductance gradually converges to the predicted results of fluctuation-electrodynamics (FE) theory in the long-wavelength approximation. Our findings reveal how surface phonon modes govern extreme near-field heat transfer across nanogap, providing insights for thermal management in electronic devices."

      "summary": "Long-range propagation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs typically occurs in ferromagnet/$s$-wave superconductor junctions, where net magnetization plays a crucial role. Here, we propose a fundamentally different scenario in which Josephson supercurrents mediated exclusively by spin-triplet pairings emerge in systems with \\textit{zero} net magnetization. We identify collinear altermagnets, particularly a subclass termed nodeless altermagnets, as ideal platforms to realize this phenomenon. These materials host spin-split Fermi surfaces that do not intersect altermagnetic nodal lines and support maximal spin-valley polarization, yielding fully spin-polarized electronic states at each valley. Consequently, Josephson junctions based on nodeless altermagnets sustain supercurrents solely through spin-polarized triplet pairing correlations, simultaneously contributed by spin-up Cooper pairs from one valley and spin-down Cooper pairs from the other. Furthermore, controlling the relative local inversion-symmetry breaking at the two interfaces enables a robust 0--$\\pi$ transition without fine tuning, while adjusting the junction orientation allows a crossover between pure triplet and mixed singlet-triplet states. Our work thus establishes nodeless altermagnets as a unique platform for altermagnetic superconductors with magnetization-free spin-polarized supercurrents."

      "summary": "Permanent magnets containing rare earth elements are essential components for the electrification of society. Ce(Co1-xCux)5 permanent magnets are a model system known for their substantial coercivity, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigate Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 magnets with a coercivity of ~1 T. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), we identify a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal decomposition. Cu-poor cylindrical cells (~5-10 nm in diameter, ~20 nm long) have a disordered CeCo5-type structure and a composition Ce(Co0.9Cu0.1)5.3. Cu-rich cell boundaries are ~ 5 nm thick and exhibit a modified CeCo5 structure, with Cu ordered on the Co sites and a composition Ce(Co0.7Cu0.3)5.0. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the intrinsic Cu concentration gradients up to 12 at.% Cu/nm lead to a spatial variation in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and domain wall energy, resulting in effective pinning and high coercivity. Compared to Sm2Co17-type magnets, Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 displays a finer-scale variation of conventional pinning with lower structural and chemical contrast in its underlying nanostructure. The identification of nanoscale chemical segregation in nearly single-phase Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 magnets provides a microstructural basis for the long-standing phenomenon of \"giant intrinsic magnetic hardness\" in systems such as SmCo5-xMx, highlighting avenues for designing rare-earth-lean permanent magnets via controlled nanoscale segregation."

      "summary": "We experimentally investigate the impulsive shock propagation caused by an impact into vertically oriented 3D granular packings under gravity. We observe a crossover of wave propagation, from sound excitation at low impact to shock front formation at high impact. One of our findings is a nonlinear acoustic regime prior to the shock regime in which the wave speed decreases with the particle-velocity amplitude due to frictional sliding and rearrangement. Also, we show that the impulsive shock waves at high impact exhibit a characteristic spatial width of approximately 10 particle diameters, regardless of shock amplitude. This finding is similar to that observed in 1D granular chains and appears to be independent of the contact microstructure, whether involving dry or wet glass beads, or sand particles. The final and main finding is that we observe the coexistence of the shock front and the sound waves (ballistic propagation and multiple scattering), separated by a distinct time interval. This delay increases with impact amplitude, due to the increase shock speed on one hand and the decrease of the elastic modulus (and sound speed) in mechanically weakened granular packings by high impact on the other hand. Introducing a small amount of wetting oil into glass bead packings leads to significant viscous dissipation of scattered acoustic waves, while only slightly affecting the shock waves evidenced by a modest increase in shock front width. Our study reveals that shock-induced sound waves and scattering play an important role in shock wave attenuation within a mechanically weakened granular packing by impact. Investigating impact-driven wave propagation through such a medium also offers one way of interrogating a 3D FPUT-like system where nonlinear and linear forces between grains are involved."

      "summary": "Neural circuits exhibit remarkable computational flexibility, enabling adaptive responses to noisy and ever-changing environmental cues. A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns how a wide range of behaviors can emerge from a relatively limited set of underlying biological mechanisms. In particular, the interaction between activities of neuronal populations and plasticity modulation of synaptic connections may endow neural circuits with a variety of functional responses when coordinated over different characteristic timescales. Here, we develop an information-theoretic framework to quantitatively explore this idea. We consider a stochastic model for neural activities that incorporates the presence of a coupled dynamic plasticity and time-varying stimuli. We show that long-term plasticity modulations play the functional role of steering neural activities towards a regime of optimal information encoding. By constructing the associated phase diagram, we demonstrate that either Hebbian or anti-Hebbian plasticity may become optimal strategies depending on how the external input is projected to the target neural populations. Conversely, short-term plasticity enables the discrimination of temporal ordering in sequences of inputs by navigating the emergent multistable attractor landscape. By allowing a degree of variability in external stimuli, we also highlight the existence of an optimal variability for sequence discrimination at a given plasticity strength. In summary, the timescale of plasticity modulation shapes how inputs are represented in neural activities, thereby fundamentally altering the computational properties of the system. Our approach offers a unifying information-theoretic perspective of the role of plasticity, paving the way for a quantitative understanding of the emergence of complex computations in coupled neuronal-synaptic dynamics."

Here, we report a pathway to manipulate the frequency, damping and absorption of YIG thin films via interface coupling. The growth on YIG of PtMn, a metallic antiferromagnet, leads to a power dependence of the oscillation frequency and an increased linewidth at low fields. In gadolinium iron garnet/YIG film bilayers, the two films couple antiferromagnetically at low temperatures and there is a strong damping of the magnetisation dynamics that is further enhanced at the spin-flop field, suppressing the FMR signal. When combining both GdIG and PtMn interfaces, we can tune the exponent of the power dependence of frequency with field and achieve an almost complete quenching of the magnetisation dynamics over a range of fields/frequencies due to non-collinear magnetic order. These effects offer a means to tune and suppress magnetisation dynamics for frequency filters, magnonics, spin pumping and other applications."

In contrast to the usual expanding dynamics of ring dark solitons in a homogeneous system, the ring FDS radius exhibits self-sustained oscillations accompanied by the nematic tensor breathing at the magnetization-vanishing ring FDS core. When the ring radius greatly exceeds the FDS width, motion is nearly elastic, and we derive the ring-radius equation of motion (EOM) which admits exact solutions. This equation can be recast into a form analogous to the inviscid Rayleigh-Plesset equation governing spherical bubble dynamics in classical fluids, but with anomalous terms. At the ring FDS core, the nematic tensor motion is parameterized by a single parameter that connects the two types of FDSs monotonically. Beyond the hydrodynamics regime, density and spin wave emissions become significant and cause energy loss, shrinking the ring FDS radius oscillation; below a threshold, collapses occur followed by the ring FDS annihilation. In the zero quadratic Zeeman energy limit, the ring radius and eigenvalues of the nematic tensor become stationary, while oscillations of the nematic tensor components, driven by the ring curvature, persist at the core. Excellent agreements are found between analytical predictions and numerical simulations."

However, their stability under realistic, finite-temperature conditions remains an open question. Here, we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of thermal magnon-magnon interactions in van der Waals honeycomb ferromagnets, focusing on both gapless and gapped Dirac magnons. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory with magnon self-energy corrections and a T-matrix resummation that captures two-magnon bound states, we quantitatively reproduce temperature- and momentum-dependent energy shifts and linewidths observed experimentally in the gapless Dirac magnon material CrBr$_3$, even near the Curie temperature. Our approach resolves discrepancies between prior theoretical predictions and experiment and highlight the significant role of bound states in enhancing magnon damping at low temperatures. For gapped Dirac magnon materials such as CrI$_3$, CrSiTe$_3$, and CrGeTe$_3$, we find a thermally induced reduction of the topological magnon gap but no evidence of thermally driven topological transitions. Classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations corroborate the gap' s robustness up to the Curie temperature. Furthermore, we establish a practical criterion for observing topological gaps by determining the minimum ratio of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to Heisenberg exchange required to overcome thermal broadening throughout the ordered phase, typically around 5%. Our results clarify the interplay of thermal many-body effects and topology in low-dimensional magnets and provide a reliable framework for interpreting spectroscopic experiments."

      "summary": "Disordered (amorphous) materials, such as glasses, are emerging as promising candidates for applications within energy storage, nonlinear optics, and catalysis. Their lack of long-range order and complex short- and medium-range orderings, which depend on composition as well as thermal and pressure history, offer a vast materials design space. To this end, relying on machine learning methods instead of trial and error is promising, and among these, inverse design has emerged as a tool for discovering novel materials with desired properties. Although inverse design methods based on diffusion models have shown success for crystalline materials and molecules, similar methods targeting amorphous materials remain less developed, mainly because of the limited availability of large-scale datasets and the requirement for larger simulation cells. In this work, we propose and validate an inverse design method for amorphous materials, introducing AMDEN (Amorphous Material DEnoising Network), a diffusion model-based framework that generates structures of amorphous materials. These low-energy configurations are typically obtained through a thermal motion-driven random search-like process that cannot be replicated by standard denoising procedures. We therefore introduce an energy-based AMDEN variant that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo refinement for generating these relaxed structures. We further introduce several amorphous material datasets with diverse properties and compositions to evaluate our framework and support future development."

      "summary": "Magnetic excitations of the exchange-dipole quasi 1D XXZ antiferromagnet are studied in the ordered phase. We observe a transformation of the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum when crossing the N\\'{e}el temperature near 0.2 K. The single-mode ESR of a correlated XXZ chain transforms in the multi-mode spectrum in the ordered phase. The multi-mode spectrum consists mainly of the intensive mode of a single correlated chain, which is surrounded and/or indented by numerous weak satellites. The number of securely fixed modes is eight at magnetic field parallel b-axis and twelve at magnetic field parallel a-axis. Besides of the multi-mode resonance observed at the transverse polarization of the microwave and static magnetic fields, we reveal a wide band of absorption by (k,-k)- pairs of quasiparticles at the longitudinal polarization. This kind of absorption of microwaves occurs both in the ordered and specific spin-liquid phases, revealing the presence of quasiparticles in the specific spin-liquid phase."

      "summary": "Increasingly intricate phase diagrams in new classes of superconductors host fascinating interactions between superconductivity, diverse quantum phases, and quantum critical dynamics. The native superfluids, however, often exhibit much lower density and much greater inhomogeneity than conventional superfluids. This may render the superconductivity susceptible to fluctuations that are ordinarily assumed to be frozen out far below the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, calling into question the degree to which the superconducting state is fully coherent. In this work, we leverage terahertz spectroscopy to demonstrate strongly fluctuating superconductivity in topological compositions of the multiband iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se). These fluctuations are found to persist undiminished far below $T_c$ and converge upon the limit of Planckian dissipation above $T_c$. These results indicate that extended quantum fluctuations dominate the electrodynamics of both the superconducting and Planckian-dissipative precursor states of Fe(Te,Se), and demonstrate that the assumption of phase coherence must be rigorously validated in emerging classes of unconventional superconductors."

The quantity $S^*$ determines strong short-range magnetic order in the absence of long-range order, in particular the correlation length.

      "summary": "This work aims to understand how quantum mechanics affects heat transport at low temperatures. In the classical setting, by considering a simple paradigmatic model, our simulations reveal the emergence of Negative Differential Thermal Resistance (NDTR): paradoxically, increasing the temperature bias by lowering the cold bath temperature reduces the steady-state heat current. In sharp contrast, the quantum version of the model, treated via a Lindblad master equation, exhibits no NDTR: the heat current increases monotonically with thermal bias. This marked divergence highlights the fundamental role of quantum effects in low-temperature thermal transport and underscores the need to reconsider classical predictions when designing and optimizing nanoscale thermal devices."

Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons."

Two points have apparently escaped their attention. First, thermal Hall signals with an amplitude well below this resolution bound have been detected in disordered perovskites. Second, the longitudinal thermal conductivity of their sample is significantly lower than the La$_2$CuO$_4$ sample displaying a thermal Hall signal.

The study focuses on the behavior of the Seebeck coefficient and its spin-resolved counterparts, with calculations performed by means of the numerical renormalization group method. We investigate the low-temperature transport regime, where a complex interplay between the two-stage Kondo effect, the ferromagnet-induced exchange field, and the Majorana coupling occurs. We demonstrate that thermoelectric measurements can reveal unique signatures of the Majorana interaction that are challenging to isolate in conductance measurements alone. It is shown that the exchange field fundamentally alters the thermoelectric response, leading to a rich, non-monotonic temperature evolution of the thermopower, which is driven by a temperature-dependent competition between the spin channels. Furthermore, we have identified qualitatively different regimes of spin thermopower generation, controlled by the interplay between the Majorana-induced asymmetry and the spin polarization of the leads. Finally, by connecting the system's thermoelectric response to the underlying transport asymmetries quantified by the conductance spin polarization, we provide a consistent and unified physical picture, proposing thermoelectric transport as a sensitive probe for Majorana signatures."

AMs combine zero net magnetization with spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, enabling the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose a four-terminal Josephson junction where a longitudinal phase bias between opposite superconducting terminals generates transverse supercurrents in the unbiased terminals. These transverse currents exhibit both a diode-like nonreciprocity and a finite anomalous phase offset, revealing a transverse anomalous Josephson effect (AJE). For certain parameter regimes, the transverse current becomes unidirectional, and the TJDE efficiency can exceed 1000\\%, demonstrating exceptionally strong diode behavior. Remarkably, the magnitude and direction of the TJDE and transverse AJE are tunable by rotating the N\\'eel vector. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for engineering field-free nonreciprocal superconducting transport in multiterminal devices."

Very recently, a novel hybrid 2D material termed glaphene, which combines monolayers of 2D silica glass and graphene, was experimentally realized. Inspired by glaphenes, we proposed a new class of similar structures named glaphynes, which are formed by stacking SiO$_2$ monolayers onto $\\alpha$-, $\\beta$-, and $\\gamma$-graphynes. Graphynes are 2D carbon allotropes with the presence of acetylenic groups (triple bonds). The glaphynes' structural and electronic properties were investigated using the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) method, as implemented in the DFTB+ package. Our analysis confirms their energetic and structural stability. We have observed that in the case of glaphynes, the electronic proximity effect can indeed open the electronic band gap, but not for all cases, even with the formation of Si-O-C bonds between silica and graphynes."

In this work, we investigate theoretically, by means of many-body perturbation theory, how interlayer twisting modulates magnetic interactions in bilayer van der Waals systems composed of two ferromagnetic layers. We demonstrate that the relative strengths of the interlayer Heisenberg exchange interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the anisotropic exchange interaction can be significantly altered by varying the twist angle between the layers, thus leading to tunable magnetic textures. We further show that these interactions are strongly dependent on the chemical potential, enabling additional control via electrostatic gating or doping. Importantly, our approach is applicable to arbitrary twist angles and does not rely on the construction of a Moir\\'e supercell, making it particularly efficient even at small twist angles."

Here, we report the first electrical characterization of gold nanowires (AuNWs) synthesized within the lumen of functionalized microtubules. Structural analyses confirm continuous metallic wires with local compositional inhomogeneities. Electrical measurements reveal three distinct conduction behaviours and abrupt, reversible resistance transitions under applied bias, consistent with defect-driven electromigration. Voltage pulsing enables active and reproducible modulation of resistance states without loss of metallic conduction, establishing a new RS mechanism intrinsic to pure metallic nanowires. Owing to their high aspect ratio, lateral geometry, and CMOS-compatible processing, microtubule-templated AuNWs provide a versatile platform for reconfigurable interconnects and neuromorphic device architectures."

Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations."

Using a first-principles many-body approach, we systematically investigate the phonon-assisted PL in bilayer MoS$_2$ and its dependence on temperature and external tensile strain. The effects of phonons are accounted for using a supercell approach: we identify the phonon momenta that are important to PL, construct supercells that are commensurate with these phonons, and examine the changes in the optical absorption after explicit displacements of atoms along each phonon mode. The PL intensity is then obtained via the van Roosbroeck-Shockley relationship from the optical absorption spectra. This approach enables us to investigate phonon-absorption and phonon-emission processes separately and how each process depends on temperature. Our results reveal that optical phonons associated with out-of-plane vibrations of S atoms and in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms contribute most to the indirect PL for unstrained bilayer MoS$_2$. Additionally, we also discuss how the PL spectra and the phonon contributions evolve with strain. In particular, we show that at high strain, additional phonon channels become available due to the modulation of the electronic band structure."

We demonstrate the formation and evolution of this phase in Fe films on C1v -symmetric (110) surfaces of GaAs and CdTe semiconductors.

The remarkable stability of the net-zero lattice is attributed to symmetry-enforced anisotropic magnetic interactions. Lowering interfacial symmetry to C1v thus enables frustrated chiral magnets, uniquely manifesting in thermodynamically stable net-zero topological soliton lattices, as revealed by our findings."

      "summary": "Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified."

      "summary": "Random graphs defined by an occurrence probability that is invariant under node aggregation have been identified recently in the context of network renormalization. The invariance property requires that edges are drawn with a specific probability that, in the annealed case, depends on a necessarily infinite-mean node fitness. The diverging mean determines many properties that are uncommon in models with independent edges, but at the same time widespread in real-world networks. Here we focus on the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the model, where the n nodes are assigned a Pareto($\\alpha$)-distributed fitness with 0 < $\\alpha$ < 1. We find that the leading eigenvalues are all of order square root of n, alternate in sign and are located at the intersection between the real axis and a logarithmic spiral in the complex plane, which we characterize analytically in terms of the Gamma function. We also calculate the associated eigenvectors, finding that they display complexvalued scaling exponents and log-periodicity, which are signatures of discrete scale invariance. In contrast with the typical finite-rank behaviour of random graphs with finite-mean variables, we find that a growing number of the leading eigenvalues emerges from the bulk, whose edge extends up to order square root of n and therefore reaches the same scale as that of the structural eigenvalues."

      "summary": "We introduce a quantity called the free mutual information (FMI), adapted from concepts in free probability theory, as a new physical measure of quantum chaos. This quantity captures the spreading of a time-evolved operator in the space of all possible operators on the Hilbert space, which is doubly exponential in the number of degrees of freedom. It thus provides a finer notion of operator spreading than the well-understood phenomenon of operator growth in physical space. We derive two central results which apply in any physical system: first, an explicit ``Coulomb gas'' formula for the FMI of two observables $A(t)$ and $B$ in terms of the eigenvalues of the product operator $A(t)B$; and second, a general relation expressing the FMI as a weighted sum of all higher-point out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). This second result provides a precise information-theoretic interpretation for the higher-point OTOCs as collectively quantifying operator ergodicity and the approach to freeness. This physical interpretation is particularly useful in light of recent progress in experimentally measuring higher-point OTOCs. We identify universal behaviours of the FMI and higher-point OTOCs across a variety of chaotic systems, including random unitary circuits and chaotic spin chains, which indicate that spreading in the doubly exponential operator space is a generic feature of quantum many-body chaos. At the same time, the non-generic behavior of the FMI in various non-chaotic systems, including certain unitary designs, shows that there are cases where an operator spreads in physical space but remains localized in operator space. The FMI is thus a sharper diagnostic of chaos than the standard 4-point OTOC."

In this paper, we present a new quantum algorithm and several complexity-theoretical results for the Berry phase estimation (BPE) problems. Our new quantum algorithm achieves BPE in a more general setting than previously known quantum algorithms, with a theoretical guarantee. For the complexity-theoretic results, we consider three cases. First, we prove $\\mathsf{BQP}$-completeness when we are given a guiding state that has a large overlap with the ground state. This result establishes an exponential quantum speedup for estimating the Berry phase. Second, we prove $\\mathsf{dUQMA}$-completeness when we have \\textit{a priori} bound for ground state energy. Here, $\\mathsf{dUQMA}$ is a variant of the unique witness version of $\\mathsf{QMA}$ (i.e., $\\mathsf{UQMA}$), which we introduce in this paper, and this class precisely captures the complexity of BPE without the known guiding state. Remarkably, this problem turned out to be the first natural problem contained in both $\\mathsf{UQMA}$ and $\\mathsf{co}$-$\\mathsf{UQMA}$. Third, we show $\\mathsf{P}^{\\mathsf{dUQMA[log]}}$-hardness and containment in $\\mathsf{P}^{\\mathsf{PGQMA[log]}}$ when we have no additional assumption. These results advance the role of quantum computing in the study of topological phases of matter and provide a pathway for clarifying the connection between topological phases of matter and computational complexity."

      "summary": "In the study of open quantum systems it is often useful to treat mixed states as pure states of a fictitious doubled system. In this work we explore the opposite approach: mapping isolated bilayer systems to open monolayer systems. Specifically, we show that arbitrary bilayer Hamiltonians possessing an antiunitary layer exchange symmetry, and subject to a constraint on the sign of interlayer couplings, can be mapped to Lindbladians on a monolayer system with some of the jump operators postselected on a fixed outcome (\"monitored\"). Low-energy states of the bilayer Hamiltonian then correspond to late-time states of the monolayer dynamics. Simulating the latter by quantum trajectory methods has the potential of substantially reducing the computational cost of estimating low-energy observables in the bilayer Hamiltonian by effectively halving the system size. The overhead due to sampling quantum trajectories can be controlled by a suitable importance sampling scheme. We show that, when the quantum trajectories exhibit free fermion dynamics, our approach reduces to the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. This provides a physically transparent interpretation of the AFQMC sign-free criteria in terms of properties of quantum dynamics. Finally, we benchmark our approach on the 1D quantum Ashkin-Teller model."

Employing the OTOC-Renyi-2 entropy theorem we derive a quantum speed limit for the OTOC, which sets an lower bound for the rate with which information can be scrambled. This bound becomes particularly tractable by describing the scrambling of information in a closed quantum system as an effective decoherence process of an open system interacting with an environment. We prove that decay of the OTOC can be bounded by the strength of the system-environment coupling and two-point environmental correlation functions. We validate our analytic bound numerically using the non-integrable transverse field Ising model. Our results provide a universal and model-agnostic quantitative framework for understanding the dynamical limits of information spreading across quantum many-body physics, condensed matter, and engineered quantum platforms."

      "summary": "The emergent practical applicability of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for approximate combinatorial optimization is a subject of considerable interest. One of the primary limitations of QAOA is the task of finding a set of good parameters. Parameter transfer is a phenomenon where QAOA angles trained on problem instances that are self-similar tend to perform well for other problem instances from that similar class. This suggests a potentially highly efficient and scalable non-variational learning method for QAOA angle finding. We systematically study QAOA parameter transferability from small problems (16, 27 qubits) onto large problem instances (up to 156 qubits) for heavy-hex graph Ising models with geometrically local higher order terms using the Julia based QAOA simulation tool JuliQAOA to perform classical angle finding for up to 49 QAOA layers. Parameter transfer of the fixed angles is validated using a combination of full statevector, Projected Entangled Pair States, Matrix Product State, and LOWESA numerical simulations. We find that the QAOA parameter transfer from single instances applied to unseen problem instances does not in general provide monotonically improving performance as a function of p - there are many cases where the performance temporarily decreases as a function of p - but despite this the transferred angles have a general trend of improved expectation value as the QAOA depth increases, in many cases converging close to the true ground-state energy of the 100+ qubit instances. We also sample the hardware-compatible Ising models using the ensemble of fixed QAOA angles on several superconducting qubit IBM Quantum processors with 127, 133, and 156 qubits. We find continuous solution quality improvement of the hardware-compatible QAOA circuits run on the IBM NISQ processors up to p=5 on ibm_fez, p=9 on ibm_torino, and p=10 on ibm_pittsburgh."

      "summary": "The term pristine interface was introduced by Beattie and Djerdjev 20 years ago for emulsions that consist of only water and oil with no surfactant. They are different from Pickering emulsions, which are also surfactant-free but stabilized with colloidal particles. In contrast to previous studies, we monitor the kinetics of the initial stages of emulsion formation. We conducted such tests in an open setup when samples are open to air and CO2 content in the water varies, and in closed setup when samples are isolated with fixed CO2 content. For the open setup, sonication and initial pH > 9 leads to emulsions with high zeta potential and sub-micron droplet size. There are two evolution patterns: short- and long-terms. The short term lasts about 1 day and has changing pH and zeta potential, but almost constant droplet size. The long term is is over several days or even weeks, with droplet size increase toward saturation value (rate dependent on mixing conditions), with pH and zeta potential remaining constant. Emulsification at the closed setup is much less pronounced and pH remains constant. This difference points to the importance of adsorbed CO2 and related carbonate ions in the formation of pristine emulsions and charging droplets interfaces. We hypothesize the existence of structured water molecule layer at the interface, following Eastoe and Ellis. The Electric Double Layer exerts a (dielectrostatic) force on the water dipole moments in this layer that compensates the Kelvins pressure. The droplet size from this model is close to our measurements. Also, there is a repulsion of the water dipole moments, which compensates for the surface tension parallel to the interface. After ruling out alternative hypotheses with our data, we conclude that the model suggested for explaining the stability of nano-bubbles is also consistent with our results for these pristine emulsions."

This work aims to determine the transition dynamics of these materials at radio-frequencies (rf) in the microwave range where they have enormous potential for new applications ranging from particle accelerators to dark matter searches. We have tested two types of coatings formed from rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO): a film deposited by electron-beam physical vapor deposition, and HTS conductor tapes soldered to a copper substrate with exposed REBCO surfaces. Testing was performed via a hemispherical transverse-electric mode cavity that maximizes the surface rf magnetic field and minimizes the surface electric field on a 2-inch diameter sample. We report on steady-state measurements at low rf power, as well as fully time-resolved transition dynamics on the microsecond timescale seen for the first time with strong surface rf fields."

This approach can efficiently solve certain quantum problems that are classically intractable, suggesting potential advantages of harnessing quantum data. However, addressing large-scale problems still requires significant amounts of data beyond the limited computational resources of near-term quantum devices. We propose a scalable ML framework called Geometrically Local Quantum Kernel (GLQK), designed to efficiently learn quantum many-body experimental data by leveraging the exponential decay of correlations, a phenomenon prevalent in noncritical systems. In the task of learning an unknown polynomial of quantum expectation values, we rigorously prove that GLQK substantially improves polynomial sample complexity in the number of qubits $n$, compared to the existing shadow kernel, by constructing a feature space from local quantum information at the correlation length scale. This improvement is particularly notable when each term of the target polynomial involves few local subsystems. Remarkably, for translationally symmetric data, GLQK achieves constant sample complexity, independent of $n$. We numerically demonstrate its high scalability in two learning tasks on quantum many-body phenomena. These results establish new avenues for utilizing experimental data to advance the understanding of quantum many-body physics."

We use reverse water gas shift as a model reaction system and show that for reactor configurations featuring a uniform metamaterial susceptor, the total system efficiency increases with scale. However, the throughput of these scaled reactors is limited by radial temperature gradients. We further show this bottleneck can be overcome by tailoring the radial effective conductivity profile of the susceptor, which can enable scaled reactors with nearly ideal plug flow-like capabilities.

      "summary": "Systems of individual electrons electrostatically trapped on condensed noble gas surfaces have recently attracted considerable interest as potential platforms for quantum computing. The electrons form the qubits of the system, and the purity of the noble gas surface protects the relevant quantum properties of each electron. Previous work has indicated that manipulation of a confining double-well potential for electrons on superfluid helium can generate entanglement suitable for two-qubit gate operations. In this work, we incorporate a time-dependent tuning of the potential shape to further explore operation of two-qubit gates with the superfluid helium system. Through numerical time evolution, we show that fast, high-fidelity two-qubit gates can be achieved. In particular, we simulate operation of the \\sqiswap and CZ gates and obtain fidelities of 0.999 and 0.996 with execution times of 2.9~ns and 9.4~ns, respectively. Furthermore, we examine the stability of these gate fidelities under non-ideal execution conditions, which reveals new properties to consider in the device design. With the insights gained from this work, we believe that an experimental realization of two-qubit gates using electrons on helium is feasible."

Combining accurate electronic structure theory, enhanced sampling, and machine learning, we fine-tune the MACE-MP0 foundation model and apply the resulting machine learning potentials to obtain statistically converged free energy profiles and reaction rates. We confirm that the level of electronic structure theory is important, and inaccurate density functionals can overestimate the reaction rate by up to nine orders of magnitude. We also find that harmonic transition state theory underestimates reaction rates by about one order of magnitude. For the surface reaction, we find and characterize a new, ultrafast decomposition pathway wherein the carbonyl is deeply inserted into the lithium surface and bent by about 70$^\\circ$. This reaction, which occurs in a few tens of picoseconds, generates a ring-opened intermediate that is a precursor for CO or CO$_2$ formation; by contrast, an alternative pathway that yields CO$_3^{2-}$ and ethylene is found to be non-competitive, occurring on a timescale of tens of nanoseconds."

On the other hand, quantum computers are emerging as powerful tools for exploring the complex dynamics of these quantum many-body systems. In this work, we demonstrate the quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using IBM's superconducting quantum computers, employing over 100 qubits. We introduce a first-order Trotterization scheme and extend it to an optimized second-order Trotterization for the time evolution in the Fermi-Hubbard model, specifically tailored for the limited qubit connectivity of quantum architectures, such as IBM's platforms. Notably, both Trotterization approaches are scalable and maintain a constant circuit depth at each Trotter step, regardless of the qubit count, enabling us to precisely investigate the relaxation dynamics in the Fermi-Hubbard model by measuring the expectation value of the N\\'eel observable (staggered magnetization) for time-evolved quantum states. Finally, our successful measurement of expectation values in such large-scale quantum many-body systems, especially at longer time scales with larger entanglement, highlights the quantum utility of superconducting quantum platforms over conventional classical approximation methods."

In particular, our result generalizes the seminal work of Chatterjee and Varadhan (2011), who derived an LDP for Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs via graphon theory. We move beyond their binary (Bernoulli) setting to encompass arbitrary edge-weight distributions. Specifically, we analyze the distribution on probability graphons induced by random weighted graphs in which edges are sampled independently from a common reference probability measure supported on a compact Polish space. We prove that this distribution satisfies an LDP with a good rate function, expressed as an extension of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability graphons and the reference measure. This theorem can also be viewed as a Sanov-type result in the graphon setting. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for analyzing rare events in weighted networks and supports statistical inference in structured random graph models under distributional edge uncertainty."

      "summary": "Event-Chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) methods generate continuous-time and non-reversible Markov processes which often display significant accelerations compared to reversible counterparts. However their generalization to any system may appear less straightforward. In this work, our aim is to distinctly define the essential symmetries that such ECMC algorithms must adhere to, differentiating between necessary and sufficient conditions. This exploration intends to delineate the balance between requirements that could be overly limiting in broad applications and those that are fundamentally essential. To do so, we build on the recent analytical description of such methods as generating Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMP). Thus, starting with translational flows, we establish the necessary rotational invariance of the probability flows, along with determining the minimum event rate. This rate identifies with the corresponding infinitesimal Metropolis rejection rate. Obeying such conditions ensures the correct invariance for any ECMC scheme. Subsequently, we extend these findings to encompass schemes involving deterministic flows that are more general than mere translational ones. Specifically, we define two classes of interest of general flows: the ideal and uniform-ideal ones. They respectively suppresses or reduces the event rates. From there, we implement a comprehensive non-reversible sampling of a systems of hard dimers by introducing rotational flows, which are uniform-ideal. This implementation results in a speed-up of up to $\\sim 3$ compared to the state-of-the-art ECMC/Metropolis hybrid scheme."

This focus has restricted time-reversal invariant TSCs to helical $p$-wave states with only a single Majorana Kramers pair, whose existence is tied to the criterion of an odd number of Fermi surfaces (FSs). In this Letter, we demonstrate that a bilayer system with pure cubic RSOC and intrinsic odd-parity pairing on a single FS yields a rare 2D helical $f$-wave TSC. This state is characterized by a large mirror Chern number (MCN) of ${\\cal N}_{\\text{M}}=3$ and hosts three Kramers pairs of Majorana edge modes. Remarkably, the interplay of linear and cubic RSOCs in this bilayer can generate a helical hybrid $p+f$-wave TSC with an even larger MCN of ${\\cal N}_{\\text{M}}=4$ from a normal state with two FSs, thereby circumventing the conventional odd-FS criterion. Our work establishes higher-order RSOC as a powerful design principle for realizing TSCs with multiple Majorana Kramers channels, fundamentally reshapes the helical hybrid for helical TSCs, and holds immediate relevance for tunable platforms like oxide heterostructures."

      "summary": "Mechanical metamaterials enable precise control over structural properties, but their design method remains challenging due to their complex structure. Although additive manufacturing has expanded geometric freedom, navigating this vast and complex design space still requires computationally intensive simulations or expert-driven processes. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design approaches have emerged to address these limitations, but many studies restrict their scope to parametric representations, limiting their generative capacity to predefined shapes. Here, we present a point cloud-based generative framework that enables the inverse design of 3D metamaterial without parametric constraints. Trained on a number of structurally valid unit cells, the present machine learning model learns geometric patterns, mitigates common connectivity issues inherent in point cloud generation. The proposed model constructs a latent space organized by mechanical properties and naturally clustered by unit cell types. By sampling this latent space, our method supports both property-guided inverse design and generation of topologically gradient transition between distinct unit cell types. This approach facilitates inverse design of 3D metamaterials with high geometric complexity."

Specifically, we study the transition of the critical behavior of such multilayer film systems from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) as a function of the film thickness and the distance to the critical point, which enables dimensional crossover observations. Our results indicate that the effective critical exponents exhibit a clear transition in their scaling behavior, with thinner films showing 2D-like characteristics and thicker films displaying 3D-like behavior, for both the DPT and the thermodynamic phase transitions (TPT). Quantitatively, the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior occurs at larger film thicknesses for the DPT compared to the TPT, suggesting that DPT and TPT are governed by distinctly different length scales and underlying surface effects. These findings are in agreement with experimental observations in ultrathin Co films, where dynamic and thermodynamic critical exponents were found to differ. Therefore, our study provides an in-depth explanation for critical phenomena in thin-film ferromagnets driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. By comparing the dimensional crossover properties of both TPT and DPT, we present a comprehensive understanding of how thin-film geometry and surface effects influence the scaling laws and critical behavior in nonequilibrium systems."

In this Letter, we investigate the transport and localization properties of electron and hole carriers in a prototypical halide perovskite (CsPbBr$_3$), through \\textit{ab initio} tight-binding nonadiabatic dynamics approach for large-scale (tens of nm size) supercell calculations, to simulate electron and ion dynamics on the same footing. We found distinct structural, lattice polarization, and electron-phonon coupling properties at low (below 100 K) and high temperatures, consistent with experimental observations. In particular, at low temperature we find spontaneous formation of polar grain boundaries in the nonpolar bulk systems, which result in two-dimensional polarization patterns that serve to localize and separate electrons and holes. We reveal phonon-assisted variable-range hopping mostly responsible for low-temperature transport, and their characteristic frequency correlates with temperature-dependent phonon power spectrum and energy oscillation frequency in nonadiabatic dynamics. We answer the critical questions of long electron-hole recombination lifetime at low temperature and offer the correlation among polarization domains, electron-phonon couplings, and photocarrier dynamics."

We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemomechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations.

We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. Specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes."

In this work, we provide a quantitative metric for the degree of chirality in solids, independent of the type of system and the dimensionality, through the continuous chirality measure (CCM). We quantitatively analyze the correlation between CCM and spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization, as well as circular dichroism (CD) and the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). By internal spin-orbit field analysis, we demonstrate a distinct character (proportionality among Rashba, Deresselhaus, and Weyl contributions) and chirality dependence among different chiral solids. Furthermore, unlike CD, we found that absorption dissymmetry factor $g_{CD}$ could remain unchanged as a function of chirality and show anisotropic dependence on CCM. In addition, we show that the relation between CCM and CPGE is rather complex. At low excitation energy close to the bandgap transition, the CCM continuously tunes the total SOC, and therefore, the CPGE response. However, at high excitation energy, CPGE includes more than just band edge transitions, which complicates the relation of chirality and CPGE due to changes in the optical dipole strength and electron-hole group velocity difference. Ultimately, this causes CPGE to be only correlated with chirality at excitation energies close to the band edge. At the end, we discussed strategies of manipulating chiral-optical properties through chirality transfer at interfaces or applying strain. The insights developed in this work will inspire the design of materials for future spintronics and orbitronics, as well as spin-optronics applications."

      "summary": "The theoretical description of materials' properties driven out of equilibrium has important consequences in various fields such as semiconductor spintronics, nonlinear optics, continuous and discrete quantum information science and technology. The coupling of a quantum many-body system to an external bath can dramatically modify its dynamics compared to that of closed systems, new phenomena like relaxation and decoherence appear as a consequence of the non-unitary evolution of the quantum system. In addition, electron-electron correlations must be properly accounted for in order to go beyond a simple one-electron or mean-field description of the electronic system. Here we discuss a first-principles methodology based on the evolution of the electronic density matrix capable of treating electron-environment interactions and electron-electron correlations at the same level of description. The effect of the environment is separated into a coherent contribution, like the coupling to applied external electro-magnetic fields, and an incoherent contribution, like the interaction with lattice vibrations or the thermal background of radiation. Electron-electron interactions are included using the nonequilibrium Green's function plus generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz. The obtained non-Markovian coupled set of equations reduces to ordinary Lindblad quantum master equation form in the Markovian limit."

Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques.

Thanks to the surface sensitivity of PES and XAS, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The layer selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the monoclinic insulating phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the rutile metallic phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the rutile metallic phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the monoclinic insulating phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the rutile metallic and monoclinic insulating phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the monoclinic insulating to the rutile metallic phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers."

In this work, we show that Eshelby-like structures can be precisely identified and localized using a topological invariant known as the continuous Burgers vector. By combining analytical and simulation techniques, we reveal the emergence of a topological Burgers ring around Eshelby plastic events, enabling the precise identification of their center of mass and capturing their orientation as well. This proposed method offers a clear and unambiguous framework to locate and characterize the plastic rearrangements that govern plasticity in glasses."

A key requirement for their practical use is the ability to control the spin order in a reliable and tunable manner. In this work, we investigate how the spin order in kagome antiferromagnets -- an important class of NCAFMs -- can be manipulated via strain. Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive an effective action for the kagome antiferromagnet that captures the coupling between the spin order and the system's strain tensor. At the microscopic level, this coupling arises from strain-induced modifications of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and exchange interactions. Using this effective description, we explore two strain-driven phenomena: (1) strain-induced switching of the antiferromagnetic spin order and (2) the piezomagnetic response. We numerically show that strain facilitates thermally assisted switching between spin configurations of opposite chirality. Specifically, we find that uniform tensile and compressive strain govern both the average switching time and the preferred switching direction between chiral states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strain induces a net magnetization and provide an experimentally testable prediction of this effect for a typical NCAFM. Our results provide a theoretical framework for modeling strain-induced manipulation of kagome antiferromagnets, underscoring strain as a promising route for functional control of NCAFMs."

As device dimensions shrink, the coercive field in ultra-thin ferroelectric films increases, which challenges low-voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase and improves ferroelectric performance. Robust ferroelectricity is observed in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, dynamic switching behavior is analyzed using the KAI model. At low frequencies (less than 16.7 kHz), capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents (0.036 and 0.028, respectively), indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent (0.093), indicating stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.036. Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction is used to measure strain differences in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, revealing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain, and switching behavior in ultra-thin films."

The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit analytical expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels."

A direct observation of this effect is elusive, due to difficulties in the quantification of SRO. Here, we deliver a structurally agnostic analysis that instead searches for unusual patterns in crystal size effects as evidence of SRO-induced strengthening. For this purpose, we assemble a large dataset of strengthening measurements drawn from a range of thermomechanical processing conditions known to produce SRO. Based on a comparative analysis with pure metal benchmarks, we find no evidence for significant coupling of SRO to strengthening in CrCoNi, and that patterns suggesting a positive finding may be explained by cross-study measurement scatter. Nevertheless, we leverage our analysis to provide an upper bound estimate of SRO-induced strengthening in the unlikely scenario where other sources of scatter are negligible."

The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\\tau\\times L\\times L = 660\\times66\\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit.

The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$. We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Its mean field yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experiments. Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals."

      "summary": "We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed."

      "summary": "Magnetic materials often exhibit complex energy landscapes with multiple local minima, each corresponding to a self-consistent electronic structure solution. Finding the global minimum is challenging, and heuristic methods are not always guaranteed to succeed. Here, we apply a recently developed automated workflow to systematically explore the energy landscape of 194 magnetic monolayers obtained from the Materials Cloud 2D crystals database and determine their ground-state magnetic order. Our approach enables effective control and sampling of orbital occupation matrices, allowing rapid identification of local minima. We find a diverse set of self-consistent collinear metastable states, further enriched by Hubbard-corrected energy functionals, when the $U$ parameters have been computed from first principles using linear-response theory. We categorise the monolayers by their magnetic ordering and highlight promising candidates. Our results include 109 ferromagnetic, 83 antiferromagnetic, and 2 altermagnetic monolayers, along with 12 novel ferromagnetic half-metals with potential for spintronics technologies."

Periodic boundary conditions(PBC) are applied in XY plane and open boundary condition (OBC) is applied along Z-direction. The thermodynamic behaviours of sublattice magnetisation, total magnetisation, magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are studied as functions of the temperature. The interesting compensation phenomenon, i.e., the vanishing of the total magnetisation even with nonvanishing sublattice magnetisation, has been observed. The compensation temperature and the critical temperature are found to depend on the strength of single-site anisotropy. The comprehensive phase diagram is shown in the temperature-anisotropy plane. The finite size analysis has been done through the temperature dependence of fourth order Binder cumulant, and the scaling exponents are estimated."

      "summary": "The ordering of magnetic or electric dipoles leading to real-space topological structures is at the forefront of materials research as their quantum mechanical nature often lends itself to emergent properties. Atomic lattice vibrations (phonons) are often a key contributor to the formation of long-range dipole textures based on ferroelectrics and impact the properties of the emergent phases. Here, using monochromated, momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (qEELS) with nanometer spatial resolution and meV-spectral-precision, we demonstrate that polar vortex lattices in PbTiO$_3$ spatially modulate the material's vibrational spectrum in patterns that directly reflect the overlying symmetry of the topological patterns. Moreover, by combining experiments with molecular dynamics simulations using machine learned potentials we reveal how these structures modify phonon modes across the vibrational spectrum. Beyond simple intensity modulation, we find that the chirality of the vortex topology imparts its unique symmetry onto phonons, producing a distinctive asymmetrical spectral shift across the vortex unit cell. Finally, the high spatial resolution of the technique enables topological defects to be probed directly, demonstrating a return to trivial PbTiO$_3$ modes at vortex dislocation cores. These findings establish a fundamental relationship between ferroelectric-ordering-induced topologies and phonon behavior, opening new avenues for engineering thermal transport, electron-phonon coupling, and other phonon-mediated properties in next-generation nanoscale devices."

This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies."

We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. A construction of constant-depth circuits of the above logical gates via cup product cohomology operation is also presented for three copies of identical toric codes on arbitrary 3-manifolds. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\\log(n))$ and $O(\\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\\log^{\\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\\log^{\\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements."

While there has been a comprehensive and concerted effort towards developing diagnostics for non-Markovian dynamics, all existing measures rely on time-domain measurements which are typically slow and expensive as they require averaging several runs to resolve small transient features on a broad background, and scale unfavorably with system size and complexity. In this work, we propose a spectroscopic measure of non-Markovianity which can detect persistent non-Markovianity in the system steady state. In addition to being experimentally viable, the proposed measure has a direct information theoretic interpretation: a large value indicates the information loss per unit bandwidth of making the Markov approximation. In the same vein, we derive a frequency-domain quantum master equation (FD-QME) that goes beyond the standard Born-Redfield description and retains the full memory of the state of the reduced system. Using the FD-QME and the proposed measure, we are able to reliably diagnose and quantify non-Markovianity in several system-environment settings including those with environmental correlations and retardation effects."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that expands the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, and plays a central role in the emergence of nonequilibrium stresses - arising from both viscous and thermal effects - that are essential to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics."

The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar \"extremal weight property\" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous \"extremal monomial property\" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the \"X-series\" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct measurement of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental bubble number density values."

We find that, at early times, the complexity of the full operator is equal to the average of the symmetry-resolved contributions. At later times, however, the interplay among different charge sectors becomes more intricate. In general, the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity depends on the charge sector, although in some cases this dependence disappears, leading to a form of Krylov complexity equipartition. Our analysis lays the groundwork for a broader application of symmetry structures in the study of Krylov space complexities with implications for thermalization and universality in many-body quantum systems."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. More broadly, fluorescent proteins emerge as tractable model systems for probing evolutionary pressures on chromoprotein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling may extend coherence time into the regime required for ultrafast gate operations, suggesting fluorescent protein dimers as a viable platform for bio-inspired qubits."

Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\\Delta \\phi_d = \\Delta \\phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\\(\\Delta \\phi_d\\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\\(\\Delta \\phi_g\\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. Up to around 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than 150 000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3 500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. For the analyzed dataset, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as >90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to few parameters, which are known only at the leading order in the perturbative expansions. The major challenges are from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and it closely relates to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of the conserved current 3-point correlators using the exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that the multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to the constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep the first few terms of the subgraphs to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to the current correlators $\\langle JJJ\\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\\langle JJ\\sigma_{T}\\rangle$ and $\\langle JJ\\sigma\\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative result with the bootstrap data and discuss its application for the conductivity near the quantum critical point."

A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated."

This study demonstrates suppression of dynamic phase errors via rapid reversal of the direction of inertial sensitivity, at a rate much faster than the measurement bandwidth of the interferometer.

Though approximate, the analytical formulas for the unstrained system are highly accurate unless the twist angle is less than 0.4°, far below the first magic angle. When the twist angle is around or above ≳ 1°, the formulas for the strained system are also highly accurate, even if the heterostrain is as large as 1 % .
