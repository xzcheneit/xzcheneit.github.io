As such, the motion of an exciton cannot be described by the same Landau quantization that characterizes the motion of a free electron or hole in magnetic field. This contrast raises the question: How can a bound exciton state in magnetic field be expressed through the Landau quantization of its electron and hole components? Here, the authors establish a scattering selection rule between the Landau levels { n e , n h } of the electron and hole components, and identify an elegant pairing law between these Landau levels, n e = n h + l . The pairing law provides information on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number l , and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. [Phys.

      "summary": "This article studies Dirac materials undergoing complex quantum phase transitions. The authors consider the case of two different types of order, e.g., magnetism and superconductivity, and demonstrate that the system can show emergent symmetry: it acts as if it has enhanced symmetry as compared to its underlying microscopic structure. Such behavior is known to be exceptional in the absence of Dirac excitations. Using a three-loop renormalization group study of the underlying Gross–Neveu–Yukawa quantum field theory, they provide evidence that it is actually prevalent in Dirac materials. [Phys. Rev.

      "summary": "Coherent control of photoelectron circular dichroism, a chiral-sensitive observable obtained upon photoionization of chiral molecules in the gas phase, is shown to be readily realized by shining an XUV frequency comb together with an IR field onto the molecular ensemble. The delay between the two fields controls the strength of the chiral observable, and adjusting the polarization directions of the two fields allows for separating chiral signatures from the bound and continuum part of the electronic spectrum.
