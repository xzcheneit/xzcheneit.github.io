      "summary": "The authors demonstrate here that incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) driven inversion symmetry breaking in YTe 3 produces a Kramers nodal line across the Brillouin zone. ARPES agrees well with a b i n i t i o band structure calculations when the CDW twin domains are considered. Consequently, symmetry-protected CDW shadow-band crossings with bilayer-split main bands that reach the Fermi level are identified. The noncentrosymmetric crystal structure has been established by x-ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy. These findings establish YTe 3 as a CDW-driven topological nodal-line metal. [Phys. Rev.

It is shown that jet drift imparts an enhancement of elliptic flow ( v 2 ) and increases the mean acoplanarity for low- and intermediate-energy particles ( p T [Phys. Rev.
