      "summary": "This work investigates experimentally and numerically the dynamics of rigid particles settling under gravity in a highly viscous fluid. We demonstrate that certain shapes: cones, crescent moons, arrowheads, and open flat rings reorient and approach a stationary configuration. We determine the mobility coefficients and the characteristic reorientation times. We find out that the two rotational-translational mobility coefficients have opposite signs. Therefore, based on the equations of motion for rigid bodies with two orthogonal planes of symmetry, theoretically derived by Joshi and Govindarajan, Phys. Rev. Lett., 134, 2025, 014002 and Ekiel-Jezewska and Wajnryb, J. Phys. Condens. Matter, 21, 2009, 204102, we conclude that the approached stationary configurations are stable. Owing to the similarity principle, our experimental findings apply to micro-objects in water-based solutions. The reorientation of sedimenting rigid particles of certain shapes to a stationary stable configuration in a relatively short time might be used for biological, medical, or industrial applications."

      "summary": "Enskog-Vlasov equation is currently the most sophisticated kinetic model for describing non-equilibrium evaporative flows. While it enables more efficient simulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in reproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by the underlying assumptions of the Vlasov forcing term. To address this limitation, this work proposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with the Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate the equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the liquid-vapour coexistence curve, vapour pressure, and surface tension coefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate non-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity distribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The findings reveal significant deviations from the Maxwellian distribution in the vapour region, suggesting that the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation becomes inaccurate when non-equilibrium effects are pronounced. Therefore, this work represents a critical step towards the development of an accurate and efficient computational framework for modelling non-equilibrium liquid-vapour flows for real fluids, with direct relevance to practical applications such as flow cooling."

      "summary": "This study investigates the fracture behavior under both opening (Mode I) and in-plane sliding (Mode II) conditions for a semi-infinite crack in a rotating, spatially graded magnetoelastic orthotropic strip with combined horizontal and vertical initial normal stresses. The strip is assumed infinite in extent, with the crack aligned along its longitudinal axis and parallel to the rotation axis. The governing field equations are reduced to an analytically tractable form by employing the Fourier transform in the spatial domain and the Laplace transform in the temporal domain. The effect of a sudden application of traction, represented by a Heaviside step function, is analyzed for both normal and shear loading conditions. The resulting boundary-value problem is addressed through the Wiener Hopf method, yielding analytical representations of the stress intensity factors (SIFs). The near tip asymptotic stress fields are evaluated to derive explicit SIF representations for each loading configuration. Laplace inversion is performed using the generalized Chebyshev Laguerre polynomial method. Numerical simulations are conducted for Uranium and Graphite--Epoxy, with isotropic materials considered for comparison to assess the role of anisotropy. The temporal evolution of the SIFs is investigated for varying material gradation parameters, rotation rates, magnetoelastic coupling, and initial stresses. Results reveal that functional grading significantly influences both the magnitude and time evolution of the SIFs, rotation introduces a stabilizing effect, and magnetoelasticity exhibits mode-dependent impacts. These findings provide valuable insight into fracture behavior in advanced magnetoelastic composites, with relevance to high-performance rotating structures such as surface acoustic wave devices, aircraft wings, and helicopter blades."

We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\\Delta S^{\\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase -- a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\\Delta S^{\\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\\Delta S^{\\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter."

While prior work has focused on separated conduction and valence bands, we probe the extensive semimetallic regime of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. We survey a rich phase diagram dominated by flavor-symmetry breaking and reveal an electric-field-driven band inversion through fermiology. Near this inversion, we find a superconducting-like state confined to a region with emergent electron and hole Fermi surfaces. In addition, two multiferroic orbital-magnetic phases are observed: a ferrovalley state near zero field and a ferroelectric state at large fields around charge neutrality. The latter shows electric-field-reversible magnetic hysteresis, consistent with a $\\Delta P \\cdot M$ multiferroic order parameter. Our fermiology analysis elucidates the correlated semimetal regime in rhombohedral graphene and underscores its potential to host diverse quantum phases."

      "summary": "Improvement of numerical methods for calculating charge transport quantities of materials from the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is important for prediction of material properties. In particular, techniques which allow for more accurate models of scattering rates and band structures while remaining less computationally involved are valuable. The self-scattering technique is one such technique for implementing energy- and momentum-dependent scattering relaxation times in Monte Carlo simulations of charge transport or iterative techniques for solving the BTE. While the technique initially uses a constant relaxation time in the simulation algorithm, we found, upon analysis of the technique, that the energy and momentum total scattering relaxation time may be recovered. To show this, we preformed self-scattering Monte Carlo simulations of electron transport for both energy-dependent and independent relaxation times. The relaxation times and the fraction of scattering type selected in the simulation matched the full rates implemented in the simulation. In order to understand these results, we developed the theory behind the technique, demonstrating that the probability distribution function of free-flight times created using the self-scattering algorithm produces the analytical probability distribution function expression generated by full energy, momentum and time dependent relaxation times and probabilities. However, certain forms of relaxation times may cause the simulation to fail, depending on implementation. Clarity about such techniques is important for improvement of charge transport simulation models and implementation of ab initio scattering rates and band structures."

Accurate predictions, however, do not guarantee an understanding of the underlying physical phenomena and the key factors that control them. In this paper, we illustrate the merits and limitations of linear regression models of glassy dynamics built on high-dimensional structural descriptors. By analyzing data for a two-dimensional glass model, we show that several descriptors commonly used in glass-transition studies display multicollinearity, which hinders the interpretability of linear models. Ridge regression suppresses some of the shortcomings of multicollinearity, but its solutions are not succinct enough to be physically interpretable. Only by using dimensional reduction techniques we eventually obtain linear models that strike a balance between prediction accuracy and interpretability. Our analysis points to a key role of local packing and composition fluctuations in the glass model under study."

      "summary": "We propose the powerful integration of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (hybridMC) algorithm and Well-Tempered Metadynamics. This new algorithm, hybridMC-MetaD, enhances the flexibility and applicability of metadynamics by allowing for the utilization of a wider range of collective variables (CVs), namely non-differentiable CVs. We demonstrate the usage of hybridMC-MetaD through five examples of rare events in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including a rare transition in a model potential system, condensation of the argon system, crystallization in a nearly-hard sphere system, a nearly-hard bipyramid system and a colloidal suspension. By taking advantage of hybridMC, which combines molecular dynamics (MD) and MC, we are able to bias the transitions along non-differentiable CVs for all five cases, which would be unfeasible with conventional MD simulations. Enabled by metadynamics, we observed significant acceleration of the phase transitions and calculated free energy barriers using the hybridMC-MetaD simulation data. For the nearly-hard bipyramid system whose crystallization is primarily driven by entropy, we report the free energy surface for the first time. Through our case studies, we show that our hybridMC-MetaD scheme reduces the complexity of using metadynamics and increases its accessibility. We believe the hybridMC-MetaD algorithm will stimulate greater interest in, and foster broader applications of metadynamics."

Here, we demonstrate that monolayer AgF$_2$ hosts a dual topological state, driven by a single ferroelastic distortion. This polar transition breaks inversion symmetry and unleashes relativistic spin-orbit effects, simultaneously imparting non-trivial topology to electrons and magnons. The result is valence bands with opposite Chern numbers, $C^E=\\pm3$, and a magnon spectrum with a full topological gap and chiral bands, $C^M=\\pm1$. This work realizes topological altermagnonics in a tangible material platform, with a clear experimental fingerprint in the transverse thermal Hall effect. The coexistence of fermionic and bosonic topology in AgF$_2$ opens new directions for designing intrinsically hybrid quantum matter."

Mitigating such losses requires controlling the formation of native oxides at the metal-air interface. Here, we report the growth of alkyl-phosphonate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Nb thin films following oxide removal. The impact of passivation was evaluated via the performance of coplanar waveguide resonators at 10mK, in terms of quality factor and resonant frequency, over six days of air exposure. Un-passivated resonators exhibited an ~80% increase in loss at single-photon power levels, whereas SAM-passivated resonators maintained excellent temporal stability, attributed to suppressed oxide regrowth. By employing a two-component TLS model, we discern distinct prominent loss channels for each resonator type and quantified the characteristic TLS loss of the SAMs to be ~5x10^-7. We anticipate our passivation methodology to offer a promising route toward industrial-scale qubit fabrication, particularly where long-term device stability is critical."

      "summary": "High temperature superconductivity is typically associated with strong coupling and a large superconducting gap, yet these characteristics have not been demonstrated in the nickelates. Here, we provide experimental evidence that Eu substitution in the spacer layer of Nd1-xEuxNiO2 (NENO) thin films enhances the superconducting gap, driving the system toward a strong-coupling regime. This is accompanied by a magnetic-exchange-driven magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. We investigate the upper critical magnetic field, Hc2, and superconducting gap of superconducting NENO thin films with x=0.2 to 0.35. Magnetoresistance measurements reveal magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity in NENO films. We interpret this phenomenon as a result of interaction between magnetic Eu ions and superconducting states in the Ni dx2-y2 orbital. The upper critical magnetic field strongly violates the weak-coupling Pauli limit. Infrared spectroscopy confirms a large gap-to-Tc ratio $2 \\Delta k_B T_c \\approx 5 - 6$, indicating a stronger coupling pairing mechanism in NENO relative to the Sr-doped NdNiO2. The substitution of Eu in the rare-earth layer provides a method to modify the superconducting gap in Nd-based nickelates, an essential factor in engineering high-Tc superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates."

These advances present new challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML) models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra in training ML models."

      "summary": "We investigate the layered magnetic semiconductor EuTe4, focusing on its intricate charge-density wave (CDW) states near and above room temperature through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic, and thermoelectric measurements.The XRD measurement revealed that the CDW state inducing the polar lattice distortion persists even at 650 K, demonstrating its remarkable thermal stability. Notably, the Seebeck coefficient near room temperature reaches values exceeding 500 uVK-1. This large Seebeck coefficient, not fully captured by a simple band calculation, is comparable to those observed in heavy-electron semiconducting oxides, suggesting the importance of electron correlation and spin/lattice instabilities. Furthermore, potentially reflecting the competition of two types of CDW states, the thermal conductivity near room temperature is as low as 0.02 Wcm-1K-1. As a result, the thermoelectric figure of merit zT reaches 0.22 at 460 K. These findings establish EuTe4 as a compelling platform to explore novel types of thermoelectric materials with multiple electronic instability."

      "summary": "We study the magnon spin photocurrent in effective spin models for Cr2O3, a material known for its magnetoelectric effect. Using nonlinear response theory, we show that magnon spin current can be generated by both linearly and circularly polarized electromagnetic waves via one-magnon processes. While linearly polarized waves induce a spin current even in the absence of a static magnetic field, circularly polarized waves lead to a spin current only when a static field is present, and the current reverses its direction upon field inversion. The distinct dependence on the external magnetic field and the contrasting responses to different polarizations allow the spin photocurrent to be differentiated from competing effects such as spin pumping or inhomogeneous heating, facilitating experimental verification. These results suggest that Cr2O3 is a promising candidate for experimental studies of magnon photocurrent."

Once dismissed as mere background hiss, it is now recognized as both a currency of information and a source of order in systems driven far from equilibrium. From nanometer-scale motor proteins to meter-scale bird flocks, active collectives harness noise to break symmetry, explore decision landscapes, and poise themselves at the cusp where sensitivity and robustness coexist. We review the physics that underpins this paradox: how energy-consuming feedback rectifies stochastic fluctuations, how multiplicative noise seeds patterns and state transitions, and how living ensembles average the residual errors. Bridging single-molecule calorimetry, critical flocking, and robophysical swarms, we propose a unified view in which noise is not background blur but a tunable resource for adaptation and emergent order in biology and engineered active matter."

In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals a narrow temperature window around 400 {\\deg}C in which crystallization occurs. At higher temperatures the phase decomposes. Pair distribution function analysis shows 2D sheets of MgZrCl$_6$ form after milling, with heating driving 3D crystallization. Raman spectroscopy also shows evidence of MgZrCl$_6$ after milling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy does not reveal ionic conductivity in MgZrCl$_6$ (limit of detection ca. $1.4 \\times 10^{-8}$ S/cm).

      "summary": "Strain engineering offers a powerful route to tailor topological electronic structures in correlated oxides, yet conventional epitaxial strain approaches introduce extrinsic factors such as substrate-induced phase transitions and crystalline quality variations, which makes the unambiguous identification of the intrinsic strain effects challenging. Here, we develop a flexural strain platform based on van der Waals epitaxy and flexible micro-fabrication, enabling precise isolation and quantification of intrinsic strain effects on topological electronic structures in correlated oxides without extrinsic interference. Through strain-dependent transport measurements of the Weyl semimetal SrRuO3, we observed a significant enhancement of anomalous Hall conductivity by 21% under a tiny strain level of 0.2%, while longitudinal resistivity remains almost constant -- a hallmark of intrinsic topological response. First-principles calculations reveal a distinct mechanism where strain-driven non-monotonic evolution of Weyl nodes across the Fermi level, exclusively governed by lattice constant modulation, drives the striking AHC behavior. Our work not only highlights the pivotal role of pure lattice strain in topological regulation but also establishes a universal platform for designing flexible topological oxide devices with tailored functionalities."

In this work, we demonstrate an alternative stabilization mechanism based on kinetic energy. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional mixture of a quasi-BEC and a Tonks-Girardeau gas, and show that the kinetic energy of the TG component can counteract the interspecies attraction, thereby preventing collapse. This balance leads to the formation of a self-bound quantum droplet, which exhibits two distinct regimes: a low-density and a high-density droplet. We argue that these regimes are smoothly connected by a crossover. Furthermore, an analysis of the derivatives of the ground state energy reveals that the transition from a miscible mixture to the droplet phase is of third order. Our findings extend the theoretical understanding of quantum droplets in low-dimensional quantum gases, and the proposed system is experimentally accessible within current ultracold atom platforms."

We argue that whether such a correction is present or not is related to the asymptotic behavior of a function that measures the extent to which the average magnetization of a finite system with an external field is influenced by the boundary conditions. Our discussion is informed by a mixture of heuristic calculations and rigorous results. Along the way, we review some recent results on the critical Ising model and prove properties of the average magnetization in two dimensions which are of independent interest."

This assignment is supported by an agreement in activation energy, capture cross-section, trap type and charge emission process, as well as simulations comparing the effects of phonon-assisted tunnelling (PAT) and Poole-Frenkel (PF) mechanisms on TSC spectra. DDTLS measurements revealed a quadratic dependence of the activation energy on the electric field strength, confirming PAT as the prevailing mechanism over PF in the case of the radiation-induced X-Defect.

Examples include nanotube brushes, nano-wire arrays, and also common biological structures. In a many-stranded bundle, there are potentially strong multi-strand vdW interactions that go beyond a simple sum of negative (attractive) pairwise inter-strand energies. Perturbative analysis showed that these contributions alternate in sign, with the odd (triplet, quintuplet, ...) terms being positive (repulsive). The triplet case leds to the intriguing speculation that these strands may prefer to coalesce into even-numbered bundles, which could have implications for the formation kinetics of DNA, for example. Here we use a non-perturbative vdW energy analysis to show that this conjecture is not true in general. As our counter-example we consider 6 strands and show that 2 well-separated bundles of 3 strands have a more negative total vdW energy than 3 well-separated bundles of 2 strands ( i.e. an odd-number preference). We also discuss a bundle of 6 strands and explore the relative contributions beyond pairwise interactions."

Magnetization measurements showed negligible coercivity, and specific heat data revealed no anomalies down to 3 K. Temperature-dependent neutron diffraction showed no evidence of long-range magnetic order. Optical absorption studies using UV-Visible spectroscopy displayed a sharp absorption edge in the UV region. Tauc analysis estimated a direct optical band gap of approximately 2.10 eV, with no clear indication of an indirect transition.

This is not only valuable in terms of acquiring fundamental understanding but is also important for future high-performance applications. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast control of magnetic relaxation in square artificial spin ice through femtosecond laser pulsed excitation, enabling rapid access to low-energy states via dipolar interactions. Time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements reveal that, after laser-induced demagnetization, the magnetization recovers within picoseconds. During this brief transient window, dipolar coupling drives a collective magnetic ordering. Ex-situ magnetic force microscopy confirms the emergence of extended Type I vertex domains, characteristic of ground-state ordering, thus establishing ultrafast laser-driven relaxation as a route to attain the low-energy states. Through complementary energy barrier calculations and micromagnetic simulations incorporating Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch dynamics, we elucidate the underlying mechanism: transient ultrafast demagnetization followed by rapid remagnetization that enables a dipolar-driven collective rearrangement. Moreover, a tailored decreasing-fluence laser annealing protocol is shown to enhance ground-state ordering, consistently achieving over 92% ground-state vertex populations. This work opens the way to ultrafast and spatially selective control of magnetic states in artificial spin ice for spin-based computation and memory technologies, and highlights the critical interplay of thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic coupling, and transient magnetization dynamics."

While control over configurations is essential, it typically requires local and individual access to all elements.

We illustrate this approach using bistable beams that snap through based on their collective rotation rate and acceleration. Through rational design and selection of drive cycles, we demonstrate targeted transitions along controllable pathways, including the writing of five-bit memories that encode all alphabetic characters. This form of dynamical control can be generalized to inertial, fluidic, electromagnetic, and electronic systems, thus providing a powerful method for writing memories and enabling smart, remotely controllable devices for applications in microfluidics, implants, smart infrastructure, and underwater or medical robotics."

The electronic and optical properties, both with and without spin-orbit coupling, have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and many-body excited-state calculations. The band gap, which is indirect in nature, is found to be 0.95 eV and 0.89 eV from PBE and PBEsol, respectively. The optical properties have been computed using four different approximations: independent particle approximation (IPA), IPA with scissor correction (IQPA), random phase approximation for local-field effects (LFEs), and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The estimated highest value of the imaginary part of the dielectric function using IQPA is 7 at 2 eV, which slightly decreases to 5.7 due to LFEs. Within BSE, the peak value is obtained to be maximum at 1.6 eV with a magnitude of 10.8, which indicates the strong excitonic effect below the optical gap. Large number of bright and dark bound excitons are found, where the binding energies of four main bound bright excitons are found in the range of 299-350 meV. The exciton amplitude in both reciprocal and real space is analyzed. The main bound bright exciton is localized in the reciprocal space, while this exhibits a delocalized nature in real space. The BSE predicts a highest absorption coefficient of 3.6 $\\times$ $10^{6}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1.7 eV, while a minimum reflectivity in the active region of the solar energy spectrum is obtained to be around 2.7\\%. Finally, the solar efficiency has been estimated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency approach and obtained highest value is 15.5% at a thickness of 0.5 $\\mu$m. These findings reveal a significant excitonic effect in the absorption spectra of RbTlCl$_{3}$ and highlight its potential as a promising material for single-junction thin-film solar cells."

      "summary": "Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is conventionally considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME), by means of a postulated Chiral Kinetic equation. In this paper we study magnetoconductivity in large Fermi energy Dirac semimetals, in one of which (ZrTe$_5$) the effect was observed for the first time. Starting with a Hamiltonian for a semi-realistic model of such a Dirac semimetal, we apply the Non-equilibrium Diagram Technique (NDT, or the Keldysh technique) to derive the kinetic equations, to investigate the electrons relaxation due to interaction with phonons and disorder, and, finally, to calculate the DC magnetoconductivity (the longitudinal to magnetic field component of conductivity) as a function of magnetic field strength and temperature. Finally, we compare the obtained temperature dependencies with available to us experimental data."

      "summary": "Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity through Pauli and orbital limiting effects. However, there are rare instances of magnetic-field-induced superconductivity, as seen in Chevrel phase compounds [1], organic conductors [2], uranium-based heavy-fermion systems [3, 4], and moire graphene [5], though these materials possess inherently low superconducting transition temperatures (Tc). Here, we demonstrate high field-stabilized superconductivity in a class of materials with a significantly higher Tc (up to 40 K): the infinite-layer nickelates [6]. Both low-field and high-field superconducting states can be plausibly explained by a compensation mechanism akin to the Jaccarino-Peter effect. These findings demonstrate the possibility of achieving substantially enhanced upper critical fields in high-temperature superconductors."

      "summary": "We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\\tau\\times L\\times L = 660\\times66\\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \\qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden."

We observe that the damping-like torque (DLT) per unit electric field depends on the choice of the ferromagnetic layer, with approximately seven times higher torque efficiency in $Ni/V$ as compared to $Fe_{60}Co_{20}B_{20}/V$. We find the sign of DLT per unit electric field from $V$ is opposite to that from $Pt$. These results collectively confirm the existence of negative orbital Hall effect (OHE) in $V$. Furthermore, the DLT per unit electric field increases with the $V$ layer thickness, maintaining the negative sign at all thicknesses. We also note that the DLT per unit electric field exceeds that of the $Pt$ reference samples at higher $V$ thicknesses. Through fitting using the drift-diffusion equation, we extract a high effective orbital Hall conductivity of $-(1.46 \\pm 0.09)\\,\\frac{\\hbar}{2e}\\,\\times 10^{5}\\,\\Omega^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ and a long orbital diffusion length of $(13.7 \\pm 0.9)\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ in $V$. ."

      "summary": "Mechanical cantilevers are central to nanotechnology, with ultimate sensitivity achieved at the atomic limit, where low bending rigidity makes stability the fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce a wrinkle-induced stiffening approach that enhances the bending rigidity of monolayer graphene by several orders of magnitude, enabling the fabrication of mechanically robust graphene cantilevers. When suspended over microcavities, these wrinkled membranes exhibit significant increases in both in-plane and out-of-plane stiffness, as confirmed by nanoindentation and resonance measurements, which also reveal that enhanced bending rigidity strongly influences their vibrational response. This behavior marks a transition from tension-dominated mechanics to a regime where bending effects become prominent, even in a single atomic layer. By sculpting these structures, we realize graphene cantilevers with measured bending rigidities between $10^6$ and $10^7$ eV, while maintaining femtogram-scale mass. These findings open new directions in nanomechanical sensing and cantilever-based technologies."

      "summary": "The study of the response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) assemblies to an external alternating magnetic field is of great interest for applications such as hyperthermia. The key quantity here is the complex susceptibility and its behavior in terms of temperature and frequency. From a theoretical point of view it can be obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with the time quantified Monte Carlo (TQMC) method if a physical time is associated with the MC step. Here we revisit this method by showing that the time unit can be derived from the MC stochastic process of the isolated particle. We first obtain a MC unit of time from the relaxation of the system at fixed temperature. Then this unit of time is used to compute complex susceptibilities. We show that it is now possible to match the TQMC results with actual experimental results regarding frequency dependent in phase susceptibilities and quantify the unit of time in seconds. Finally we show that the time unit obtained for the isolated particle remains valid when considering interacting particles such as the Heisenberg coupling or dipole dipole interactions."

Their plastic deformation responses differed markedly: in the as-built {\\alpha^\\prime} phase, slip activation followed the sequence prismatic \\rightarrow basal \\rightarrow pyramidal I \\langle c+a \\rangle, whereas in the heat-treated {\\alpha} phase, the sequence was basal \\rightarrow prismatic \\rightarrow pyramidal I \\langle c+a \\rangle.

The interfacial geometries featuring Co- or CoCo-atomic terminations for the Co2MnAl slab exhibit larger adhesion energies compared to those terminated with Mn-, Al-, or MnAl-atomic terminations. This indicates their greater interfacial stability. In contrast, MnAl-, Mn-, or Al-terminated interfaces preserve near half-metallicity, whereas Co- and CoCo-terminated geometries display a strongly metallic character. All studied interfaces show enhanced magnetic moments relative to their bulk counterparts, primarily arising from interfacial atoms and their nearest neighbours. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing Co2MnAl-based heterostructures in spintronic applications."

We demonstrate the use of time-reversal and space-group symmetries to obtain exciton eigenstates at symmetry-related center-of-mass momenta in the entire Brillouin zone from eigenstates calculated for center-of-mass momenta in the irreducible Brillouin zone. Furthermore, by explicitly calculating the irreducible representations of the little groups, we classify excitons according to their symmetry properties across the Brillouin zone. Using projection operators, we construct symmetry-adapted linear combinations of electron-hole product states, which block-diagonalize the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) Hamiltonian at both zero and finite exciton center-of-mass momenta. This enables a transparent organization of excitonic states and provides direct access to their degeneracies, selection rules, and symmetry-protected features. As a demonstration, we apply this formalism to monolayer MoS$_{2}$, where the classification of excitonic irreducible representations and the block structure of the BSE Hamiltonian show excellent agreement with compatibility relations derived from group theory. Beyond this material-specific example, the framework offers a general and conceptually rigorous approach to the symmetry classification of excitons, enabling significant reductions in computational cost for optical spectra, exciton-phonon interactions, and excitonic band structure calculations across a wide range of materials."

Intriguing recent evidence points towards a possibly chiral superconducting ground state, unlike the superconductivity found in other polytypes where the T layers are absent, requiring understanding of the possible contributions of electrons from the T layers. Here we use micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal that the T termination of the 4H\\textsubscript{b} structure is metallic, but a subsurface T layer -- seen below an H termination and thus more representative of the bulk case -- is gapped. The results imply a complete charge transfer of 1 electron per 13 Ta from the T to adjacent H layers in the bulk, but an incomplete charge transfer at the T termination, yielding a metallic Fermi surface with a planar-chiral character. A similar metallic state is found in an anomalous region with likely T-H-H' stacking at the surface. Our results exclude cluster Mott localisation in either the bulk or surface of 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ and point to a scenario of superconductivity arising from Josephson-like tunneling between the H layers."

Recently, ambient-pressure superconductivity is achieved in R-P bilayer nickelate thin films through epitaxial compressive strain, unlocking in-depth investigations into the superconducting characteristics. Here, through electrical transport study, we report the observation of spin-glass superconductivity with hysteretic magnetoresistance and glass-like dynamics in the bilayer nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films. The superconductivity develops in a two-step transition, with onset Tc exceeding 50 K and zero-resistance Tc around 15 K. Remarkably, magnetoresistance hysteresis, indicative of time-reversal symmetry breaking, is observed exclusively during the second-step transition to zero resistance. The hysteresis is observed under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields with significant anisotropy, and exhibits coalescing minima at zero field, fundamentally distinct from trapped vortices or long-range-ordered magnetism with coercivity. Successive oxygen reductions simultaneously suppress the superconductivity and hysteresis, revealing their mutual connections to the selective electronic orbitals. The removal of magnetic field triggers spontaneous and logarithmically slow resistance relaxations in the second-step transition, signatures of glassy dynamics, indicating that the superconducting ground state is correlated with an electronic spin-glass order. Our findings uncover an unprecedented superconducting state in the nickelate superconductors, providing phenomenological and conceptual advances for future investigations on high-Tc superconductivity."

For each class, we explore four distinct regimes defined by the presence or absence of interactions and disorder, employing both the Krylov-subspace iterative method and the correlation matrix approach. The ECW emerges universally across all cases, establishing its independence from particle statistics, interaction strength and disorder. In free fermions, the ECW formalism further enables analytical determination of the correlation matrix spectrum. The subsequent melting of the ECW exhibits symmetry- and statistics-dependent signatures, revealing finer structures in the growth of symmetry-resolved entanglement."

Hubbard $U$ corrections can mitigate such errors, but are often detrimental to the description of hybridized states, leading to spurious force contributions and wrong lattice structures. Here, we show that careful disentanglement of localized and delocalized states leads to accurate predictions of electronic states and structural distortions in ternary monouranates (AUO$_4$, where A represents Mn, Co, or Ni), for which standard $U$ corrections generally fail. Crucial to achieving such accuracy is a minimization of the mismatch between the spatial extension of the projector functions and the true coordination geometry. This requires Wannier-like alternatives to atomic-orbital projector functions, or corrections of Hubbard manifolds exclusively comprised of the most localized A-$3d$, U-$5f$ and O-$2p$ orbitals. These findings open up the computational prediction of fundamental properties of actinide solids of critical technological importance."

Pb atom is sensitive to all phase transitions, changing its dynamics with temperature. As temperature decreases, the crystal undergoes a sequence of three phase transitions. The first one to an intermediate (IM) phase, in which polar fluctuations are detected by THz and IR spectroscopy at frequencies below 100 cm-1 contributing to the maximum of permittivity and revealing important softening. Additional antipolar Pb fluctuations and softening were detected by Raman spectroscopy. At lower temperature, another transition to an antiferroelectric (AFE2) phase is revealed by nonpolar soft modes (antipolar and antiferrodistortive ones), and by an important drop of the dielectric strength of polar phonons. The final transition to the antiferroelectric phase (AFE1) is revealed by the appearance of new modes and a sudden change in the frequency of the soft modes when the antipolar shifts become larger. Using symmetry analysis and optical observation to study how the domain pattern changes with temperature, we identified a path for the cubic-AFE2 transition throughout the IM phase, of plausible tetragonal symmetry, driven by an instability from the center of the Brillouin zone. This mechanism coexists with antiferrodistortive instabilities that eventually drive the material into the AFE2 phase. The final phase transition to the AFE1 phase naturally follows from a mode outside the center of the Brillouin zone and a further doubling of the unit cell."

Due to the metastable nature of the ferroelectric phase in these materials, dopants and process parameters need to be optimized for its stabilization. Here, we present clear evidence of how dopants affect the properties in this material system and solutions to achieve improved reliability, desired crystallization behavior and polarization hysteresis shape/position through co-doping. Finally, the benefits of co-doping in a variety of application fields are demonstrated."

      "summary": "Flat-band (FB) materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring exotic quantum phases. While numerous candidates have recently been identified through spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, central challenges remain on how to tune FBs towards the Fermi level $E_F$ and to understand their impact on low-energy excitations probed in electronic transport experiments. Here, we show that, by attributing the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures to electron-phonon interband scattering, one can infer the position of FBs near $E_F$ across diverse material classes. As charge carriers scatter off phonons, interband transitions into FB states lead to distinctive sub- or superlinear resistivity at elevated temperatures, governed by the proximity of the FB to $E_F$. Our phenomenological model captures these universal transport behaviors observed across several recently studied FB compounds and offers a simple, broadly applicable method for detecting flat bands."

The correlation between the effective potential of the steady-state distribution and the logarithm of the exit rates determines the quality of this approximation. We demonstrate and explain this phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional particle system and in random dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass by providing the first explicit estimates of this correlation. We find that, as parameters of the dynamics vary, each system exhibits a threshold above and below which the correlation dramatically differs. We explain how these thresholds arise from underlying transitions in the relationship between the local and global \"parts\" of the effective potential."

In addition, 4Hb-TaS$_2$ shows negligible out-of-plane dispersion of the 1T-derived bands, in contrast to the pronounced interlayer coupling observed in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate this picture, revealing that the interlayer interaction of the chiral order in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is nearly two orders of magnitude weaker than in the 1T polytype.

      "summary": "When droplets of colloidal suspensions evaporate, the suspended colloids are transported to the edge of the drop by an outward radial flow. The resulting dried deposit has a high concentration of colloids along it's perimeter, and a low concentration near the center. This effect has been dubbed the coffee-ring effect [Deegan et al., Nature, 1997, 389, 827], and is undesirable in applications such as inkjet printing, where a smooth deposition would lead to more efficient coatings. Previous attempts at suppressing this effect using particle anisotropy have paradoxically shown that anisotropic particles can (1) form even deposits [Yunker et al., Nature, 2011, 476, 308] and (2) enhance the coffee ring effect [Dugyala et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2014, 119, 3860]. Here we use surface profilometry data to characterize the width of the dried deposits containing rod-shaped silica colloids of aspect ratios ranging from 1 to 20. We observe deposits over a broad range of concentrations (up to 0.35 volume fraction), and find that the width of the ring is independent of the particle anisotropy, even at previously unexplored high volume fractions. We also observe that polystyrene spheres form more even deposits than silica spheres when evaporated at high temperatures. This result serves to unify the literature by identifying a key parameter in controlling the deposit shape: the difference between the sedimentation velocity of colloids in solution and the velocity of the air-water interface."

In many-body settings, one can further characterize quantum operations based on underlying geometrical constraints, and a natural question is to understand the power of resource-generating operations that preserve locality. In this work, we address this question within the resource theory of asymmetry, which has recently found applications in the study of many-body symmetry-breaking and symmetry-restoration phenomena. We consider symmetries corresponding to both abelian and non-abelian compact groups with a homogeneous action on the space of $N$ qubits, focusing on the prototypical examples of $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$. We study the so-called $G$-asymmetry $\\Delta S^{G}_N$, and present two main results. First, we derive a general bound on the asymmetry that can be generated by locality-preserving operations acting on product states. We prove that, in any spatial dimension, $\\Delta S^{G}_N\\leq (1/2)\\Delta S^{G, \\rm max}_N[1+o(1)]$, where $\\Delta S^{G, \\rm max}_N$ is the maximum value of the $G$-asymmetry in the full many-body Hilbert space. Second, we show that locality-preserving operations can generate maximal asymmetry, $\\Delta S^{G}_N\\sim\\Delta S^{G, \\rm max}_N$, when applied to symmetric states featuring long-range entanglement. Our results provide a unified perspective on recent studies of asymmetry in many-body physics, highlighting a non-trivial interplay between asymmetry, locality, and entanglement."

The spin chains we investigate are given by the XXZ model with or without an external longitudinal magnetic field as well as the XX model, the XY model, and the Ising model, all of them subjected to an external transverse magnetic field."

      "summary": "The behavior of active matter under confinement poses significant challenges due to the intricate coupling between dynamics near boundaries and those in the bulk. A defining feature of active matter systems is that a substantial portion of their dynamics takes place near confining boundaries. In our previous work, we developed a kinetic framework that enables direct computation of the probability distribution functions for both the position and orientation of active rods. A distinguishing aspect of this approach is its explicit treatment of wall accumulation through the use of two coupled probability distribution functions: one describing the bulk population and the other representing rods accumulated at the boundary. Another novel feature is the structure of the governing equation, which is degenerate: it is second-order in one non-temporal variable and first-order in another. The main focus of this paper is to rigorously justify this model via multi-scale analysis. We first establish well-posedness of the system and then employ two distinct multi-scale derivations to obtain the model as a singular limit of a more classical kinetic system in the regime of vanishing translational diffusion. For analytical clarity, we consider the case in which active rods, once accumulated at the wall, remain permanently confined there. This work provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for reduced kinetic models of confined active matter, bridging microscopic dynamics and macroscopic accumulation phenomena."

We rationalize our observations with a model considering that crystals appear at a constant rate depending on the thermal shock on the expanding interface. This model provides dimensionless curves on the number and the surface area of crystals that we compare to our experimental measurements."

      "summary": "Particle-exchange machines utilize electronic transport to continuously transfer heat between fermionic reservoirs. Here, we couple a quantum mechanical resonator to a particle-exchange machine hosted in a quantum dot and let the system run autonomously. This way, part of the energy exchanged between the reservoirs can be stored in the resonator in the form of self-oscillations. Our analysis goes well beyond previous works by exploring the slow transport regime and accessing arbitrarily strong dot--resonator coupling. First, we introduce a faithful measure of self-oscillations, and use it to certify that they can occur in the slow-transport regime. We furthermore show that the electrical current through the dot can be used to witness self-oscillations. Finally, we establish that, under realistic conditions, self-oscillations occur only when the machine operates as a heater. We define an experimentally measurable performance metric characterizing the efficiency of current--to--self-oscillations conversion. It reveals that, counterintuitively, strong dot--resonator coupling is detrimental to the conversion performance. The framework developed here can be readily implemented in a variety of nanoscale devices, such as a suspended carbon nanotube with an embedded quantum dot."

      "summary": "Centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) incorporates nuclear quantum statistics into the calculation of vibrational spectra. However, when performed in Cartesian coordinates, CMD shows serious unphysical artifacts in certain vibrational bands, known as the curvature problem. Recent work showed that CMD spectra can be freed from the curvature problem by evolving the ring-polymer centroid on a potential of mean force (PMF) calculated at an elevated temperature ($T_e$-CMD). Here we present a partially-adiabatic implementation of $T_e$-CMD (PA-$T_e$-CMD), which eliminates the need for precomputed PMFs and instead yields the centroid force \\textit{on-the-fly}. We introduce a two-temperature path-integral Langevin thermostat to achieve a temperature separation between centroid and internal modes of the ring-polymer. Because it is paramount that the elevated temperature be chosen as low as possible for a given physical temperature in this formulation, we present a general scheme for its determination. We benchmark PA-$T_e$-CMD against exact vibrational spectra for the isolated water monomer and discuss its performance for challenging anharmonic systems: the carbonic acid fluoride molecule (CAF) and the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPI). We conclude that PA-$T_e$-CMD mitigates the curvature problem and eliminates the steep increase in computational cost with decreasing temperature of conventional path-integral methods. We observe some energy leakage from the hot internal modes to high-frequency centroid modes at low physical temperatures. Nevertheless, compared to other imaginary path-integral approximate methods, the PA-$T_e$-CMD spectra show more accurate lineshapes. While a fully adiabatic setup based on a coarse-grained centroid PMF is still preferable when a good pre-trained PMF can be easily obtained, PA-$T_e$-CMD presents a low-barrier single-shot setup for any system."

These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations."

Through a quench protocol where the system evolves from the steady state of one Lindbladian to another, we reveal that topological transitions can occur at analytically predictable critical times, even when the initial and final steady states share identical topological indices. These transitions are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to depend solely on dissipation parameters. Entanglement spectrum analysis demonstrates bulk-edge correspondence in non-equilibrium density matrices via coexisting single-particle gap closures (periodic boundaries) and topologically protected zero modes (open boundaries), directly underpinning the detection of dissipation-induced topology in quantum simulators."

      "summary": "Many real-world phenomena can be modelled as dynamical processes on networks, a prominent example being the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Mean-field approximations are a widely used tool to analyse such dynamical processes on networks, but these are typically derived using plausible probabilistic reasoning, introducing uncontrolled errors that may lead to invalid mathematical conclusions. In this paper we present a rigorous approach to derive mean-field approximations from the exact description of Markov chain dynamics on networks through a process of averaging called approximate lumping. We consider a general class of Markov chain dynamics on networks in which each vertex can adopt a finite number of ``vertex-states'' (e.g. susceptible, infected, recovered etc.), and transition rates depend on the number of neighbours of each type. Our approximate lumping is based on counting the number of each type of vertex-state in subsets of vertices, and this results in a density dependent population process. In the large graph limit, this reduces to a low dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, special cases of which are well known mean-field approximations. Our approach provides a general framework for the derivation of mean-field approximations of dynamics on networks that unifies previously disconnected approaches and highlights the sources of error."

In particular, we use symmetric matrix product states and introduce link-enhanced matrix product operators (LEMPOs) that can act on both the physical and virtual spaces of the matrix product states. This construction allows us to study Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories on infinite lattices.

      "summary": "Living cells exhibit a complex organization comprising numerous compartments, among which are RNA- and protein-rich membraneless, liquid-like organelles known as biomolecular condensates. Energy-consuming processes regulate their formation and dissolution, with (de-)phosphorylation by specific enzymes being among the most commonly involved reactions. By employing a model system consisting of a phosphorylatable peptide and homopolymeric RNA, we elucidate how enzymatic activity modulates the growth kinetics and alters the local structure of biomolecular condensates. Under passive condition, time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron source reveals a nucleation-driven coalescence mechanism maintained over four decades in time, similar to the coarsening of simple binary fluid mixtures. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that peptide-decorated RNA chains assembled shortly after mixing constitute the relevant subunits. In contrast, actively-formed condensates initially display a local mass fractal structure, which gradually matures upon enzymatic activity before condensates undergo coalescence. Both types of condensate eventually reach a steady state but fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates a peptide diffusivity twice higher in actively-formed condensates consistently with their loosely-packed local structure. We expect multiscale, integrative approaches implemented with model systems to link effectively the functional properties of membraneless organelles to their formation and dissolution kinetics as regulated by cellular active processes."

Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian serve as a genuine witness of bipartite entanglement and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point. In the paradigmatic spin-boson model, the non-monotonic features of the quantum Fisher information matrix signal changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems."

      "summary": "Interlaced metallic wire meshes are 3D metamaterials consisting of two intertwined metallic networks. These plasmonic double nets give rise to otherwise unobserved longitudinal, weakly dispersive and broadband electron acoustic modes from the effective plasma frequency of the double net down to arbitrarily low frequencies. These modes have recently been shown to generate confined slab modes with extremely long lifetimes (high quality factors), so-called quasi-bound states in the continuum. This work reveals the central role of the double net termination in determining the mode's resonant frequency and quality factor. We compare two limiting cases, a tennis net termination recently studied experimentally by others and a protruding column array with a much lower quality factor, as demonstrated by microwave transmission experiments and full-wave simulations. Our work thus vividly demonstrates the failure of a homogenisation approach to explain and quantify the physics of terminated plasmonic network materials. We introduce a new approach, in which additional evanescent bulk states are included in the scattering problem, yielding a qualitative understanding of the slab's optical response. The resulting engineering principles pave the way for the design and exploitation of these materials for applications such as coherent light generation."

The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that not only includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) but also accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters."

The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data."

      "summary": "Carbon dots (CDs) are renowned for their bright and tunable photoluminescence (PL), stability, and biocompatibility, yet it remains challenging to link their heterogeneous structures to their spectroscopic properties. This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to systematically investigate how the spectroscopic properties of CDs of complex CDs with multiple layers and multiples defects are determined by their structures and compositions. Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing groups, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift absorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing groups, such as hydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission, except when they interact strongly with more oxidizing groups. We find that not only the excitation energy, but also the excitation character itself is impacted by the presence of specific groups, and the pH-dependence of the spectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent excitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated folding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation energies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally observed emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights provide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including bioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices."

We first consider a quantum Hall droplet within finite $N$ matrix Chern-Simons theory. Taking into account the differential geometry of the matrix Chern-Simons droplet for a partially-filled fuzzy two-sphere, we first generalize the quantization procedure by replacing the Poisson bracket, a classical Lie derivative, with a quantum counterpart, the Lie derivative for a deformed fuzzy sphere. This yields the topological invariant introduced in earlier works on the quantum skyrmion Hall effect and previously unidentified fusion rules. This is consistent with treatment of a spin $S$ of multiplicity $2S+1$ as a quantum Hall droplet within matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N=2S+1$ spinless electrons and a generalization of a Jain composite particle for a Laughlin state. We then construct $D$-dimensional arrays of coupled small $N$ matrix Chern-Simons droplets as effective field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. In higher-symmetry constructions, this yields what appears to be a D+1 dimensional $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory, but actually contains $\\delta$ extra fuzzy dimensions from the finite $N$ MCS theory as well as deformations from $U(N)$ due to partial filling of the fuzzy spheres. In this construction, the Chern-Simons level is $k+1$ for each small $N$ droplet, while the entire array can be interpreted as an unbounded matrix Chern-Simons theory at level $k$. Such constructions at $k=2$ are consistent with earlier results for the multiplicative Chern insulator. We also formulate the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in terms of a Lagrangian for an array of potentially distinct, small $N$ droplets within anisotropic fuzzification. We discuss the relevance of these results to spin lattice models and lattice gauge theories."

      "summary": "Linear electromagnetic wave scattering systems can be characterized by an impedance matrix that relates the voltages and currents at the ports of the system. When the system size becomes greater than the wavelength of the fields involved, the impedance matrix becomes a complicated function of the details of the system, in which case a statistical model, such as the Random Coupling Model (RCM) becomes useful. The statistics of the elements of the RCM impedance matrix depend on the excitation frequency, the spectral density of the modes of the enclosed system volume, the average loss factor (Q^{-1}) of the system, and the properties of the coupling ports as given by their radiation impedances. In this paper, properties of the elements of impedance matrices are explored numerically and experimentally. These include the two point frequency correlation functions for the complex impedance of elements and the expected difference in frequencies between which impedance values are approximately repeated. Universal scaling arguments are then given for these quantities, hence these results are generic for all sufficiently complicated scattering systems, including acoustic and optical systems. The experimental data presented in this paper come from microwave graphs, billiards, and three-dimensional cavities with embedded tunable perturbers such as metasurfaces. The data is found to be in generally good agreement with the predictions for the two point frequency correlations and the frequency interval for successive repetitions of impedance matrix elements values."

Of particular interest are RTNs on hyperbolic geometries, with local tensors typically chosen from the unitary Haar measure, that model critical boundary states of holographic bulk-boundary dualities. In this work, we elevate static pictures of ensemble averages to a dynamical one, to show that RTN states exhibit equilibration of time-averaged operator expectation values under a highly generic class of Hamiltonians with non-degenerate spectra. We prove that RTN states generally equilibrate at large bond dimension and also in the scaling limit for three classes of geometries: Those of matrix product states, regular hyperbolic tilings, and single \"black hole\" tensors. Furthermore, we prove a hierarchy of equilibration between finite-dimensional instances of these classes for bulk and boundary states with small entanglement. This suggests an equivalent hierarchy between corresponding many-body phases, and reproduces a holographic degree-of-freedom counting for the effective dimension of each system. These results demonstrate that RTN techniques can probe aspects of late-time dynamics of quantum many-body phases and suggest a new approach to describing aspects of holographic dualities using techniques from statistical mechanics."

This gives the most accurate ab initio total energy till date. However, our results show that the per-atom EPI energy is unit-cell-size dependent due to the partial-Fan-Migdal term that arises from the antisymmetric nature of the crystal wavefunction. Due to this, only energy differences between polytypes, in supercells with identical number of atoms, are meaningful, rather than per-atom total energy. This violates our understanding of Quantum Mechanics applied to periodic solids and raises serious theoretical questions. In his original (1951) paper, Fan suggested, without specifying any reason, that second-order perturbation theory applied to the whole crystal is of questionable validity. Our results support Fan's suggestion for the reason that the partial-FM term makes the per-atom total energy unit-cell-size dependent. This leads to a new fundamental problem in condensed matter physics, viz. second-order perturbation theory is invalid for whole crystals, an entire class. It is essential to resolve this problem, especially because it causes the standard Hamiltonian, the starting point of EPI studies and the most accurate ab initio total energy, to be of questionable validity."

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements comparing Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$I$_8$ allow us to experimentally confirm these findings by revealing spectroscopic footprints of the degree of correlation. Our calculations uncover how the thickness and the stacking affect the degree of correlations and predict that the entire material family can be tuned into correlated charge-transfer or Mott-insulating phases upon doping. Our magnetic property analysis based on our model parameter library additionally confirms that inter-layer magnetic interactions drive the lattice phase transition to the low-temperature structures. The accompanying bilayer hybridization through inter-layer dimerization yields magnetic singlet-like ground states in the Cl, Br, and I compounds. We further prove that all low-temperature compounds are dynamically stable and that electron-phonon coupling to the low-energy subspace is suppressed. Our findings establish Nb$_3$X$_8$ as a robust, versatile, and tunable class for van der Waals-based Coulomb and Mott engineering with a rich phase diagram and allow us to speculate on the symmetry-breaking effects necessary for the recently observed Josephson diode effect in NbSe$_2$/Nb$_3$Br$_8$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures."

Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited.

      "summary": "Identifying the universality class of critical active phase transitions has been the subject of recent interest and controversy. Resolving these controversies will require robust numerical investigations to determine whether active critical exponents point to novel universality classes or are consistent with established ones. Here, we conduct large-scale computer simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis of motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in three dimensions (3D), finding that the static and dynamic critical exponents all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which flows to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and likely the entire phase diagram of active Brownian spheres is similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics."

      "summary": "Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally."

However, continuum solids with inherent non-reciprocal mechanics remain underexplored, despite their promising potential for applications such as wave guiding, robotics, and adaptive materials. Here, we introduce a design principle by employing the shear jamming transition from granular physics to engineer non-reciprocal mechanics in soft composite solids. Through the control of the interplay between inclusion contact networks and matrix elasticity, we achieve tunable, direction-dependent asymmetry in both shear and normal mechanical responses. In addition to static regimes, we demonstrate programmable non-reciprocal dynamics by combining responsive magnetic profiles with the anisotropic characteristics of shear-jammed systems. This strategy enables asymmetric spatiotemporal control over motion transmission, a previously challenging feat in soft materials. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for designing non-reciprocal matter, bridging granular physics with soft material engineering to realize functionalities essential for mechano-intelligent systems."

      "summary": "Quasiparticles are central to condensed matter physics, but their stability can be undermined by quantum many-body interactions. Magnons, quasiparticles in quantum magnets, are particularly intriguing because their properties are governed by both real and spin space. While crystal symmetries may be low, spin interactions often remain approximately isotropic, limiting spontaneous magnon decay. Textbook wisdom holds that collinear Heisenberg magnets follow a dichotomy: ferromagnets host stable magnons, while antiferromagnetic magnons may decay depending on dispersion curvature. Up to now, relativistic spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear order that connect spin space to real space, were shown to introduce more complex magnon instability mechanisms. Here, we show that even in nonrelativistic isotropic collinear systems, this conventional dichotomy is disrupted in altermagnets. Altermagnets, a newly identified class of collinear magnets, exhibit compensated spin order with nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking and even-parity band splitting. Using kinematic analysis, nonlinear spin-wave theory, and quantum simulations, we reveal that even weak band splitting opens a decay phase space, driving quasiparticle breakdown. Additionally, d-wave altermagnets form a rare ``island of stability'' at the Brillouin zone center. Our findings establish a quasiparticle stability trichotomy in collinear Heisenberg magnets and position altermagnets as a promising platform for unconventional spin dynamics."

The additional tuning parameters cause the SSH4 (SSHLR) model to host chiral symmetry protected two (two and four) zero-energy modes producing a richer phase diagram that we characterize by momentum space, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space winding numbers. We introduce time to study charge transport in the periodically driven SSH4 and SSHLR models under the adiabatic limit. We remarkably find that the whole parameter space turned topological for a certain choice of the remaining parameters leading to always finite quantized value of pumped charge at the end of a complete cycle. Considering time as another variable, we characterize these new phases of the driven models by momentum space Chern number, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space Bott index. We also investigate the time evolution of pumped charge for these models and connect it with the intriguing windings of the mid-gap energy levels with time. Interestingly, the maximum value of Chern number or Bott index for the driven models is more than that of the winding number associated with the static model indicating the fact that there exist more zero-energy modes during the full course of a driving cycle compared to the underlying static models. We further extend our study to the quantum metric where the fluctuations in the above quantity can identify the presence of a topological phase boundary."

In this study, we introduce well-controlled, localized defects in the form of isolated missing struts to evaluate their impact on crack growth in brittle lattice specimens. Using mechanical testing combined with digital image correlation (DIC), we track crack propagation and identify failure processes at the scale of individual lattice cells. While the imperfections do not alter the location of crack initiation or the peak load, they consistently lead to an increase in work to failure when the crack path is tortuous or crack bridging occurs. These findings demonstrate how small, targeted modifications to an otherwise regular lattice can significantly influence fracture resistance in brittle architected materials."

      "summary": "In statistical physics, it is well established that the liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with divergent critical fluctuations belongs to the Ising universality class. Whether non-equilibrium effects can alter this universal behavior remains a fundamental open question. Here, we theoretically investigate LG criticality in a hyperuniform (HU) fluid of active spinners, where phase separation is driven by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the critical point the HU fluid displays normal Gaussian density fluctuations rather than the expected divergence, while the compressibility still diverges. The system is thus calm yet highly susceptible, in fundamental violation of the conventional fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Consistently, we observe anomalous zero-range correlation functions coexisting with quasi-long-range response functions. Based on a generalized model B and renormalization-group analysis, we show that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension from $d_c = 4$ to $d_c = 2$, and the system exhibits anomalous finite-size scaling in density fluctuations, energy fluctuations, and the Binder cumulant. Furthermore, the HU fluid undergoes non-classical spinodal decomposition, where the decomposition time diverges but the characteristic length scale remains finite as criticality is approached. The origin of these anomalies lies in the center-of-mass-conserving dynamics of the spinners, which endows the system with a scale-dependent effective temperature, $T_{\\rm eff} \\propto q^2$, underlying a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relationship. These findings establish a striking exception to classical paradigms of critical phenomena and illustrate how non-equilibrium forces can fundamentally reshape universality classes."

      "summary": "Accurate computational modeling of damage and fracture remains a central challenge in solid mechanics. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used for numerical modeling of fracture problems; however, classical damage models without gradient regularization yield mesh-dependent and usually inaccurate predictions. The use of gradient damage with FEM improves numerical robustness but introduces significant mathematical and numerical implementation complexities. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can encode the governing partial differential equations, boundary conditions, and constitutive models into the loss functions, offering a new method for fracture modeling. Prior applications of PINNs have been limited to small-strain problems and have incorporated gradient damage formulation without a critical evaluation of its necessity. Since PINNs in their basic form are meshless, this work presents a PINN framework for modeling fracture in elastomers undergoing large deformation without the gradient damage formulation. The PINN implementation here does not require training data and utilizes the collocation method to formulate physics-informed loss functions. We have validated the PINN's predictions for various defect configurations using benchmark solutions obtained from FEM with gradient damage formulation. The crack paths obtained using the PINN are approximately insensitive to the collocation point distribution. This study offers new insights into the feasibility of using PINNs without gradient damage and suggests a simplified and efficient computational modeling strategy for fracture problems. The performance of the PINN has been evaluated through systematic variations in key neural network parameters to provide guidance for future applications. The results provide motivation for extending PINN-based approaches to a broader class of materials and damage models in mechanics."

      "summary": "Heat transfer is a critical aspect of modern electronics, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential for building faster, smaller, and more powerful devices with an improved performance and efficiency. In such nanoscale structures, the heat transfer between two materials is limited by the finite thermal boundary conductance across their interface. Using ultrafast electron diffraction under grazing incidence we investigated the heat transfer from ultrathin epitaxial Pb films to an Si(111) substrate under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Applying an intense femtosecond laser pulse, the 5-7 ML thin Pb film experiences a strong heat up by 10-120 K while the Si substrate remains cold at $\\approx$ 10 K. At such large temperature discontinuities we observe a significantly faster cooling for stronger excited Pb films. The decrease of the corresponding cooling time constant is explained through the thermal boundary conductance in the framework of the diffuse mismatch model. The thermal boundary conductance is reduced by more than a factor of three in comparison with Pb films grown on H-terminated substrates, pointing out the importance of the morphology of substrate, heterofilm and their interface."

With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals."

Large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit.

Here, we present a direct experimental demonstration of non-local magnon transport in the \\textit{d}-wave altermagnet \\ch{LuFeO3}, using both spin Seebeck and spin Hall effect-based injection and detection. We observe a non-local spin signal at zero magnetic field when the transport is along an altermagnetic direction, but not for transport along other directions. The observed sign reversal between two distinct altermagnetic directions in the spin Seebeck response demonstrates the altermagnetic nature of the magnon transport. In contrast, when transport is aligned along or perpendicular to the easy axis, both the first-harmonic signal and the sign-reversal effect vanish, consistent with symmetry-imposed suppression. These findings are supported by atomistic spin dynamics simulations, as well as linear spin wave theory calculations, which explain how our altermagnetic system hosts anisotropic spin Seebeck transport. Our results provide direct evidence of direction-dependent magnon splitting in altermagnets and highlight their potential for field-free magnonic spin transport, offering a promising pathway for low-power spintronic applications."

Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($>$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials."

      "summary": "We develop a closed-form analytical theory for the transport of a chiral active Brownian particle (cABP) in three dimensions, moving through a fluctuating local density field that coarse-grains steric and dynamical interactions in a dense active medium. The density field is modeled as an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process with finite correlation time $\\tau$ and fluctuation strength $\\sigma_\\rho^2$, capturing both spatial variations and temporal memory. Within this framework, we derive exact expressions for the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and time-dependent diffusivity, showing how chirality and density coupling renormalize orientational persistence and generate dynamical crossovers. The theory predicts: (i) anomalously high initial diffusivity in denser regions, arising from a transient drift driven by local swim-pressure gradients; (ii) a finite crossover time $t_c$ for homogenizing density inhomogeneities, with steady-state diffusivity retaining memory of the initial environment; (iii) a non-monotonic $t_c(\\Omega)$ with a global minimum at intermediate chirality, and a three-regime suppression of $D_\\infty(\\Omega)$ consistent with clustered phases in simulations; and (iv) a resonance-like peak in early-time oscillatory transport at an optimal chirality $\\Omega^*$. The framework reproduces known scaling of $D_\\infty$ with activity and chirality, while uncovering new memory effects and chirality-controlled optimal transport, offering predictive insight for biological circle swimmers and active metamaterials."

The characterization of anomalous diffusion from the measurement of an individual trajectory is a challenging task, which traditionally relies on calculating the trajectory mean squared displacement. However, this approach breaks down for cases of practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, heterogeneous behaviour, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new approaches have been proposed, mostly building on the ongoing machine-learning revolution. To perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition, the Anomalous Diffusion challenge (AnDi). Participating teams applied their algorithms to a commonly-defined dataset including diverse conditions. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, machine-learning-based approaches achieved superior performance for all tasks. The discussion of the challenge results provides practical advice for users and a benchmark for developers."

Our method exploits the mesoscopic-leads formulation, where macroscopic reservoirs are modeled by a finite collection of modes that are continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium by an appropriate Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. Focussing on non-interacting fermionic systems, we access the time-resolved full counting statistics through a trajectory unraveling of the master equation. We show that the integral fluctuation theorems for the total entropy production, as well as the martingale and uncertainty entropy production, hold. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuations of the dissipated heat in finite-time information erasure. Conceptually, our approach extends the continuous-time trajectory description of quantum stochastic thermodynamics beyond the regime of weak system-environment coupling."

We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. It is known that environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models."

In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $6 \\leq k\\leq13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge."

Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations."

The attractors observed in theoretical models are first driven by a rapid expansion of matter, which later gives way to the decay of exponentially damped transient excitations into the viscous fluid regime. Recently, a theoretical proposal was made how to realize hydrodynamic attractors in cold atomic gases focusing on the decay of transients and opening prospects for a future experimental realization in table top experiments. Motivated by this, in the present paper we show how the far-from-equilibrium, expansion-driven part of the hydrodynamic attractor emerges in a model of a nearly-unitary Fermi gas."

In most experimental settings, however, performing arbitrary quantum measurements is highly unfeasible. In open quantum systems, an alternative approach to metrology involves the measurement of stochastic currents flowing from the system to its environment. However, the present understanding of current-based metrology is mostly limited to Markovian master equations. Considering a parameter estimation problem in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor, we identify the key elements that determine estimation precision within the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism. Crucially, this approach allows us to address arbitrary coupling and temperature regimes. Furthermore, we obtain analytical results for the precision in linear-response and zero-temperature regimes. For the specific parameter estimation task that we consider, we demonstrate that the boxcar transmission function is optimal for current-based metrology in all parameter regimes."

Here we revisit this problem and show that, surprisingly, material dissipation alone cannot fully regularize the singular behavior of the normal modes of a nonreciprocal cavity. We demonstrate that the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics."
