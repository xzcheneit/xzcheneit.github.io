      "summary": "Neutron stars, the remnants of supernova explosions, are the densest objects in the Universe. A typical neutron star has a mass between one and two solar masses, and a radius of around 12 km. The density at the center of the star is higher than that in atomic nuclei. As a result, the properties of neutron stars provide important information about the behavior of ordinary matter under extreme compression. In recent years, new information about neutron stars has emerged from two sources. The first is the observation of the gravitational-wave signal from the final inspiral of a coalescing binary neutron star. The second is a careful measurement of the x-ray pulse profile of a spinning neutron star. This review discusses these measurements and summarizes how they constrain masses, radii, and central densities. The results are compared to predictions based on calculations of the nuclear equation of state at densities comparable to that in atomic nuclei, which are then extrapolated to higher density. The review ends with an outlook on future observational opportunities. [Rev. Mod. Phys. 97, 045007] Published Wed Dec 24, 2025"

This Letter presents a mixed dynamical-decoupling (MDD) protocol to simultaneously suppress spatial variations and temporal noise, enabling robust coherence protection. Theory shows that MDD can extend coherence times to several minutes while providing intrinsic resilience to field inhomogeneity, to support operation with ensembles of up to 10 4 ions and rf magnetic field sensitivity of 13 fT/ Hz .
