This apparent paradox has sparked recent proposals to restore stability by projecting out repulsive modes, effectively restricting the problem to the attractive sector. The authors show here that a Bogoliubov variational construction yields a bounded free energy and stabilizes the BCS state, without constraining the energy landscape. Simple models highlight the role of the full BCS kernel in correctly identifying collective modes, offering a robust framework for multichannel superconductors. [Phys. Rev.

      "summary": "In quantum metrology, Lindblad estimation spans a host of applications, from probing weak stochastic signals to noise spectroscopy and characterization of emerging technologies. Regrettably, the ultimate quantum limits of Lindblad estimation are not understood in general. By examining the performance of the optimal sequential strategy that can simulate any other metrological strategy, the authors show that it is best to rapidly projectively measure and reinitialize the quantum state. This protocol may accelerate searches for stochastic gravitational waves, quantum gravity, and axionic dark matter, and also may enhance noise spectroscopy with qubits and Pauli Lindblad estimation.

Using density functional theory, Boltzmann transport theory, and explicit consideration of phonon-phonon and electron-phonon interactions, the authors show that BaCuGdTe 3 exhibits ultralow κ l , due to its layered structure and local distortions that strongly suppress acoustic phonon modes, and excellent electrical transport properties, due to strong covalent bonding within its layers. These results can be used as a basis for designing compounds with ultralow κ l . [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, L041003] Published Fri Oct 17, 2025"
