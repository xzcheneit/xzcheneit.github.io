      "summary": "Magnetic domains are known to move along temperature gradients, a phenomenon for which various mechanisms have been theoretically proposed. Here, the authors use magnetic force microscopy to quantify this effect for domains in a perpendicularly magnetized Pt/CoB/Ir multilayer. The domains always moved towards the hottest region. Quantitative evaluation of the different effects that could drive the domain motion shows that entropic forces, related to the spatial gradient in domain wall energy, dominate over spin-transfer torques arising from currents of magnons or electron spins.

These are SC1, in which the critical temperature ( T c ) decreases with increasing pressure, and SC2, where T c increases. Using 125 Te NMR measurements, the authors reveal the coexistence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic fluctuations, where the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are enhanced as pressure increases. This suggests a significant role for antiferromagnetic fluctuations in stabilizing the SC2 phase, while rendering the SC1 phase less favorable. [Phys. Rev. B 113, 014510] Published Tue Jan 20, 2026"
