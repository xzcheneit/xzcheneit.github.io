Both are governed by a Landauer-type expression for the current, though arising from distinct theoretical frameworks: fluctuational electrodynamics and Landauer–Büttiker scattering theory. The authors develop here a quantum scattering theory for thermal excitations, revealing that the reactive response of thermal bodies leads to an energy-current operator beyond the Landauer–Büttiker formalism.

Nevertheless, combining high quality factors with strongly coupled and tunable nonlinear resonators in a scalable architecture remains challenging.

By metallizing the membranes and actuating them capacitively, the team achieves tunable frequencies and controllable coupled parametric responses.

Their results highlight finite-size and finite-depth effects and provide a practical framework for benchmarking quantum devices, enabling validation of much larger systems than previously possible.
