      "summary": "A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \\to 0$ or $Wi \\to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \\to \\infty$ and $El \\ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications."

      "summary": "Understanding how frustration and disorder shape relaxation in complex systems is a central problem in statistical physics and quantum annealing. Spin-glass models provide a natural framework to explore this connection, as their energy landscapes are governed by competing interactions and constrained topologies. We investigate the non-exponential relaxation behavior of spin glasses on network architectures relevant to quantum annealing hardware -- such as finite size Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr graphs -- where embedding constraints and finite connectivity strongly modulate the distribution of barriers and metastable states. This slow relaxation arises from the combined effects of frustration and disorder, which persist even beyond the conventional spin-glass transition. Within the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Coniglio-Klein (FKCK) cluster formalism, the appearance of unfrustrated cluster regions gives rise to multiple relaxation scales, as distinct domains follow different dynamical pathways across a rugged energy landscape. This framework enables a more comprehensive characterization of spin-glass energy landscapes and offers valuable insight into how topological constraints and disorder jointly govern relaxation dynamics, providing quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the performance and limitations of quantum annealing architectures."

      "summary": "Cesium based halide perovskites, such as CsPbI3 and CsSnI3, have emerged as exceptional candidates for next generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic technologies, but their practical application is limited by temperature dependent phase transitions and structural instabilities. Here, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials within the LATTE framework to simulate these materials with near experimental accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost compared to previous computational studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations based on the trained MLIPs reproduce energies and forces across multiple phases, enabling large scale simulations that capture cubic tetragonal orthorhombic transitions, lattice parameters, and octahedral tilting with unprecedented resolution. We find that Pb based perovskites exhibit larger octahedral tilts and higher phase transition temperatures than Sn based analogues, reflecting stronger bonding and enhanced structural stability, whereas Sn based perovskites display reduced tilts and lower barriers, suggesting tunability through compositional or interface engineering. Beyond these systems, our work demonstrates that MLIPs can bridge first principles accuracy with simulation efficiency, providing a robust framework for exploring phase stability, anharmonicity, and rational design in next generation halide perovskites."

      "summary": "Better wall plug efficiency of deep-ultraviolet light emitting diodes (DUV-LEDs) requires simultaneous low resistivity p-type and n-type contacts, which is a challenging problem. In this study, the co-optimization of p-InGaN and n- AlGaN contacts for DUV LEDs are investigated. We find that using a thin 7%InGaN cap is effective in achieving ohmic p-contacts with specific contact resistivity of 3.10x10^{-5} Ohm.cm^2. Upon monolithic integration of p- and n- contacts for DUV LEDs, we find that the high temperature annealing of 800C required for the formation of low resistance contacts to n-AlGaN severely degrades the p-InGaN layer, thereby reducing the hole concentration and increasing the specific contact resistivity to 9.72x10^{-4} Ohm.cm^2. Depositing a SiO2 cap by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) prior to high temperature n-contact annealing restores the low p-contact resistivity, enabling simultaneous low-resistance p- and n-contacts. DUV-LEDs emitting at 268 nm fabricated with the SiO2 capping technique exhibit a 3.5 V reduction in operating voltage at a current level of 400 A/cm^2 and a decrease in differential ON-resistance from 6.4 mOhm.cm^2 to 4.5 mOhm.cm^2. This study highlights a scalable route to high-performance, high-Al-content bipolar AlGaN devices."

We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain."

The possibility of an effectively attractive character of the minority components is established by constructing a generalized reduction scheme for an imbalanced N-component setup with arbitrary interaction signs. These components may suffer intra- and inter-component modulation instability, which along with the presence of an attractive potential well induces the dynamical formation of highly reproducible vector rogue waves. Exploiting different Rb hyperfine states, it is possible to flexibly tune the effective interactions stimulating the realization of a plethora of vector rogue waves, including single and double Peregrine-like wave peaks. The experimental findings are in quantitative agreement with suitable three-dimensional mean-field simulations, while quasi-one-dimensional analysis of the non-polynomial Schr\\\"odinger model provides additional insights into the rogue wave characteristics."

      "summary": "Thermodynamic phase transitions, a central concept in physics and chemistry, are typically controlled by an interplay of enthalpic and entropic contributions. In most cases, the estimation of the enthalpy in simulations is straightforward but evaluating the entropy is notoriously hard. As a result, it is common to induce transitions between the metastable states and estimate their relative occupancies, from which the free energy difference can be inferred. However, for systems with large free energy barriers, sampling these transitions is a significant computational challenge. Dedicated enhanced sampling algorithms require significant prior knowledge of the slow modes governing the transition, which is typically unavailable. We present an alternative approach, which only uses short simulations of each phase separately. We achieve this by employing a recently developed deep learning model for estimating the entropy and hence the free energy of each metastable state. We benchmark our approach calculating the free energies of crystalline and liquid metals. Our method features state-of-the-art precision in estimating the melting transition temperature in Na and Al without requiring any prior information or simulation of the transition pathway itself."

      "summary": "Predicting and controlling the transport of colloids in porous media is essential for a broad range of applications, from drug delivery to contaminant remediation. Chemical gradients are ubiquitous in these environments, arising from reactions, precipitation/dissolution, or salinity contrasts, and can drive particle motion via diffusiophoresis. Yet our current understanding mostly comes from idealized settings with sharply imposed solute gradients, whereas in porous media, flow disorder enhances solute dispersion, and leads to diffuse solute fronts. This raises a central question: does front dispersion suppress diffusiophoretic migration of colloids in dead-end pores, rendering the effect negligible at larger scales? We address this question using an idealized one-dimensional dead-end geometry. We derive an analytical model for the spatiotemporal evolution of colloids subjected to slowly varying solute fronts and validate it with numerical simulations and microfluidic experiments. Counterintuitively, we find that diffuseness of solute front enhances removal from dead-end pores: although smoothing reduces instantaneous gradient magnitude, it extends the temporal extent of phoretic forcing, yielding a larger cumulative drift and higher clearance efficiency than sharp fronts. Our results highlight that solute dispersion does not weaken the phoretic migration of colloids from dead-end pores, pointing to the potential relevance of diffusiophoresis at larger scales, with implications for filtration, remediation, and targeted delivery in porous media."

In this paper, we introduce an energy-conserving contact dynamics framework for arbitrary convex rigid-body particles, integrating vertex-boundary interactions in 2D with vertex-surface and edge-edge detection in 3D. This formulation enables continuous force evaluation and strictly prevents particle overlap while conserving total energy during translational and rotational motion. Simulations of polygonal and polyhedral particles confirm the framework's stability and demonstrate its capability to capture packing behavior, anisotropic diffusion, and equations of state. The framework establishes a robust and extensible foundation for investigating the nonequilibrium dynamics of complex nonspherical particle systems, with potential applications in colloidal self-assembly, granular flow, and hydrodynamics."

Using quantum mechanical density functional theory calculations, we propose a prototypical bilayer heterostructure composed of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and silicon carbide (SiC), characterized by a lattice mismatch of 18.77\\% between their primitive unit cells. We find that the removal of boron atoms from specific lattice sites can convert the interlayer interaction from weak vdW coupling to robust localized silicon-nitrogen covalent bonding. Motivated by this, we study the binding of transition-metal adatoms and formulate design guidelines to enhance surface reactivity, thereby enabling the controlled isolation of single-metal atoms. Our machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations confirm both dynamical stability and metal anchoring feasibility at finite temperatures. Our results suggest the hBN/SiC heterostructure as a versatile platform for atomically precise transition-metal functionalization, having potential for next-generation catalytic energy-conversion technologies."

      "summary": "We investigate the collective dynamics of active Brownian particles (ABPs) subjected to a steady two-dimensional four-roll-mill flow using numerical simulations. By varying the packing fraction ($\\phi$), we uncover a novel flow-induced phase separation (FIPS) that emerges beyond a critical density ($\\phi \\geq 0.6$). The mean-square displacement (MSD) exhibits an intermediate bump between ballistic and diffusive regimes, indicating transient trapping and flow-guided clustering. The effective diffusivity decreases quadratically with $\\phi$, while the drift velocity remains nearly constant, demonstrating that large-scale transport is primarily dictated by the background flow. Number fluctuations show a crossover from normal to giant scaling, signaling the onset of long-range density inhomogeneities in the FIPS regime. Our findings provide new insights into the coupling between activity, crowding, and flow, offering a unified framework for understanding phase behavior in driven active matter systems."

The technique uses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the high-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using optical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a continuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse widths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in Y3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the characteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their relative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and coherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse of 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate, corresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle. Our results show that time-dependent strobe light measurement of magnetization dynamics can be achieved in the gigahertz frequency range under a pump-probe detection scheme."

Conventional strategies often rely on filler incorporation or chemical modification, which can limit energy dissipation and constrain structural stability. Here, we leverage the unique morphology of Spirulina trichomes to investigate a reinforcement mechanism based on physical filament entanglement. By comparing helical trichomes with their morphologically straightened counterparts, we isolate filament geometry as the key parameter governing mechanical performance. Trichome-based suspensions exhibit enhanced viscoelastic response and a threefold increase in yield stress. When processed via extrusion-based 3D printing using hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) as a matrix, entangled trichomes yield a 290% improvement in bending strength and a 15-fold enhancement in work of fracture. Fracture surface analysis reveals a transition from interfacial debonding and pull-out (in filaments) to crack propagation through the entangled network, indicating structure-mediated toughening. These findings establish trichome entanglement as a scalable, physically driven mechanism for enhancing damage tolerance through microstructural architecture."

Secondly, these classes of materials present electronic states with unusual properties, leading to exotic phenomena and making them relevant for potential applications. In this thesis we explore both fundamental and technological aspects of the first discovered topological phase: the topological insulator. To this end, we consider different models of topological insulators with a particular emphasis on Bismuth compounds, evaluating their viability for photovoltaic applications, and separately, the impact of structural disorder on their properties."

This advance permits a direct investigation of superconducting order over a wide temperature range and facilitates a comparison with zero-temperature infinite Projected Entangled Pair State simulations.

In this work, we investigate the vibrational dynamics of the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice using a spring-mass model with central-force interactions. The model incorporates mass contrast and variable coupling strengths among nearest, next-nearest, and third-nearest neighbors. From the dynamical matrix, we obtain the phonon dispersion relations and identify tunable phononic band gaps governed by both mass and spring-constant ratios. The angular dependence of phase and group velocities is analyzed to reveal the pronounced anisotropy inherent to this lattice geometry. We also examine the distinctive features of the square-octagon geometry, including flat-band anomalies in the density of states and anisotropic sound propagation induced by longer-range couplings. In addition, we explore the emergence of chiral phonons by introducing a time reversal symmetry-breaking term in the dynamical matrix, and to elucidate their optical signatures, we construct a minimal model to study infrared circular dichroism arising from chiral phonon modes."

      "summary": "Understanding the pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductors remains a core challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly the ongoing debate over whether the related effects caused by electron-electron interactions unify various unconventional superconductors (UcSs). To address this challenge, it is necessary to establish a universal quantitative relationship for the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$), which can be directly obtained from experiments and correlated with microscopic parameters of different material systems. In this work, we establish a relation: $N_{\\text{CP}}\\cdot k_{B}T_{c}^\\star = \\alpha\\cdot U $, where $\\alpha = 1/(16\\pi)$ is a universal constant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{c}^\\star$ is the maximal $T_{c}$, $U$ is the on-site Coulomb interaction, and $N_{\\text{CP}}$($\\propto(\\xi_0/a)^D$) quantifies the spatial extent of Cooper pairs ($\\xi_0$) relative to lattice parameter ($a$) in $D$ dimensions. The validity of this scaling relationship is empirically demonstrated, across a four order-of-magnitude $T_c^\\star$ range (0.08--133 K), by database from 173 different compounds spanning 13 different UcS families in over 500 experiments. The fact that the unified relationship is satisfied by different materials of different UcS families reveals that they may share superconducting mechanisms. In addition, the scaling relationship indicates the existence of a maximum $T_{c}^\\star$ determined by the minimum $N_{\\text{CP}}$, providing a benchmark for theoretical and experimental exploration of high-temperature superconductivity."

Using reactive molecular dynamics and first-principles calculations, we show that long-range ordered Ni$_2$Cr in Ni-33at.%Cr alloys corrodes far more rapidly in FLiNaK salt at 800{\\deg}C than short-range ordered or random solid solutions. This accelerated attack originates from percolating Cr pathways that enhance near-surface diffusion and a lowered energetic barrier for Cr dissolution, as confirmed by first-principles calculations. Contrary to earlier explanations that attributed this behavior to residual stresses, our stress-free simulations demonstrate that ordering alone accelerates the degradation. These results establish percolation as a critical link between chemical ordering and corrosion kinetics, offering a mechanistic basis for experimental observations."

The quasilinear dependence of MR on the magnetic field at low temperatures and the practically isotropic properties of MR in these compounds are tentatively attributed to the specifics of Weyl electron spectra and general disorder of the materials."

      "summary": "Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies."

In this work, we apply uniaxial tensile and compressive strain to thin 1T-TaS2 flakes using a flexible, device-compatible platform, and systematically investigate the strain-dependent behavior of the nearly commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC) CDW phase transition. This transition is driven by Joule heating at room temperature. Electrical transport measurements reveal that both the switching threshold voltage and the resistance of the NC-CDW phase exhibit clear, reversible strain dependence. Furthermore, we identify a quadratic dependence between the strain-induced resistance change and the threshold voltage, confirming that piezoresistive modulation governs the strain-tunability of the phase transition. We demonstrate a room-temperature, electrically-readout strain and displacement sensor with threshold-like response in a programmable window. These results highlight the potential of 1T-TaS2 for on-chip sensing of strain and displacement."

      "summary": "Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) exhibit remarkable optical and electrical properties making them one of the most promising materials for next generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Their electronic properties strongly depend on their chirality, i.e., their structural configuration, as well as on the presence and nature of atomic defects. Currently, the lack of versatile and efficient structural characterization techniques limits SWCNT applications. Here, we report how four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical challenges in SWCNT structural analysis. Using modern fast pixelated electron detectors, we were able to acquire rapidly a large number of low noise electron diffraction patterns of SWCNTs. The resulting 4D-STEM data allow to precisely determine the local chirality of multiple nanotubes at once, with limited electron dose (down to 1750 e-/{\\AA}^2) and nanometric spatial resolution (down to 3.1 nm). We also show how this approach enables to track the chirality along a single nanotube, while giving access to the strain distribution. Then, we report how 4D-STEM data enable to reconstruct high-resolution images with electron ptychography. With this second approach, structural information can be obtained with atomic scale spatial resolution allowing atomic defect imaging. Finally, we investigate how multi-slice electron ptychography could provide even further insight on nanotube defect structures thanks to its close to 3D imaging capabilities at atomic resolution."

In the present paper, we report an enhancement of ionic conductivity in Cu2P2-xVxO7 by vanadium substitution. The electrical (dc and ac conductivity, diffusivity, hopping rate, electric modulus and dielectric properties) and crystal structural properties of Cu2P2-xVxO7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) are investigated by impedance spectroscopy and neutron diffraction, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study confirms the presence of Cu2+, P5+and V5+ mono-valence states. The dc conductivity results reveal a two orders of magnitude enhancement of ionic conductivity from ~3.81x10-5 S cm-1 for x =0 to ~2.08x10-3 S cm-1 for x =1 at 993 K, revealing a possible application in SOFCs. DC transport number studies reveal that the total conductivity is dominated by ionic conduction (> 95%). In addition, the diffusivity and hopping rate of oxide ions increase with increasing x. Besides, ac conductivity, electric modulus and dielectric properties have been investigated to illustrate the microscopic conduction mechanism. The derived results suggest that the mechanism for ionic conduction is the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) process. The soft-bond valence sum (BVS) analysis of the neutron diffraction patterns reveals the three-dimensional (3D) oxide ion conduction pathways within the crystal structure. The present study provides a pathway to enhance the ionic conductivity, as well as understanding of microscopic conduction mechanism, ionic conduction pathways and the role of crystal structure on the ionic conduction."

The model is motivated by the physics of fracton excitations, which only possess mobility in a reduced dimension compared to the full model. We provide an exact mapping of this model to an arbitrary number of independent transverse-field Ising chain segments with open boundary conditions. The number and lengths of these segments correspond directly to the number of immobile excitations and their respective distances from one another. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces between them, resulting in a non-trivial spectrum."

Among many options, Cs2AgBiBr6 stands out as one of the most suitable eco-friendly materials for numerous optoelectronic applications. In this study, quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBr6 nanosheets (NSs) were prepared via the low-temperature injection colloidal synthesis and used to fabricate high-performance photodetectors in a transport-layer-free architecture. The reaction temperature and ligands played vital roles in the structural purity, shape, and size of the synthesized Cs2AgBiBr6 NSs. The fabricated NSs disclosed lateral sizes of up to 1.4 um and are only a few nanometers thick. The high-performance photodetectors fabricated using the Cs2AgBiBr6 NSs yielded a high detectivity (D) of 1.15*10^12 Jones, responsivity (R) of 121 mA/W, a notable on/off ratio of 2.39*10^4, and a fast rise and decay time of 857 and 829 us, respectively. The device demonstrates remarkable stability. Basically, it sustains its entire photocurrent after storage in ambient conditions for 80 days. This work showcases a pathway for the colloidal synthesis of quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBr6 lead-free double perovskite NSs with suitable properties for high-performance photodetection and other optoelectronic applications."

In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical instabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization, the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the system's environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may depend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how simple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments."

By combining numerical simulations of a binary Vicsek model and the analysis of coarse-grained continuum equations, we demonstrate that nonreciprocity destabilizes the ordered phase formed by mutually aligning or anti-aligning species in a large part of the phase diagram. For aligning populations, this instability results in one species condensing in a single band that travels within a homogeneous liquid of the other species. When interactions are anti-aligning, both species self-assemble into polar clusters with large-scale chaotic dynamics. In both cases, the emergence of structures is accompanied by the demixing of the two species, despite the absence of repulsive interactions. Our theoretical analysis allows us to elucidate the origin of the instability, and show that it is generic to nonreciprocal flocks."

It is shown that when covering a linear cavity on the flat surface of a graphite crystal with a multilayer graphene sheet, an open (unfilled slit) can form only if the cavity width does not exceed a critical value L_o (for width L>L_o, only a closed state of the slit is formed, with the cavity space filled by the covering sheet). The critical width of the open slit L_o increases monotonically with the number of layers K in the covering sheet. For a single-layer cavity, there is a finite critical value of its width L_o 7.6nm, a stationary closed state is also possible, in which its lower and upper surfaces adhere to each other. Simulation of thermal oscillations showed that open states of two-layer slits with width L 400K transition from the open to the closed state. Open states of three-layer slits are always stable against thermal oscillations."

We find the orbital-disordered phase in LaMnO$_{3}$ to comprise a mixture of differing structural distortions with and without inversion symmetry, implying a mixture of different orbital arrangements. These distortions are highly dynamic with an estimated lifetime of $\\sim 40$ fs at 1,000 K, and their fluctuations converge with the timescales of conventional thermal motion in the high-$T$ phase - indicating that the electronic instability responsible for static Jahn-Teller distortions at low temperature instead drives phonon anharmonicity at high temperatures.

We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities in the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes either in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion manipulation enabled by the IL-DMI."

The lack of a predictive theory directly connecting the architecture of the nucleation cap to the resulting (n,m) has hindered the controlled synthesis of specific chiralities. Here, we derive a universal topological sum rule that quantifies this relationship. We show that (n,m) is uniquely determined by the sum of the coordinates of the six pentagons in the cap. The complete set of these coordinates, evaluated across rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully defines the carbon cap structure. This rule establishes that chirality is encoded deterministically at nucleation, as any perturbation to the pentagon positions overwhelmingly leads to a predictable, quanti able, and entropically irreversible shift in (n,m). We further explain the preferential formation of the (126) nanotube by identifying a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to the catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the focus from growth kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis."

      "summary": "Simulating finite temperature phase transitions from first-principles is computationally challenging. Recently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have opened a new avenue for finite-temperature calculations with near-first-principles accuracy. Here we use MLFFs, generated using on-the-fly training, to investigate structural phase transitions in four of the most well-studied ferroelectric oxides; BaTiO$_3$, PbTiO$_3$, LiNbO$_3$ and BiFeO$_3$. Only using the 0 K ground state structure as input for the training, the resulting MLFFs can qualitatively predict all the main structural phases and phase transitions, while the quantitative results are sensitive to the choice of exchange correlation functional with PBEsol found to be more robust than LDA and r$^2$SCAN. MD simulations also reproduce the experimentally observed order-disorder character of Ti displacements in BaTiO$_3$, the abrupt first order transitions of BiFeO$_3$ and PbTiO$_3$, and the mixed order-disorder and displacive character of the ferroelectric transition in LiNbO$_3$. Finally, we discuss the potential and limitations of using MLFFs for simulating ferroelectric phase transitions."

      "summary": "Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin: Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics."

By comparing microscopic simulations, stochastic partial differential equations, and their deterministic counterparts, we analyze four models of increasing complexity. Our results identify macroscopic quantities that can be altered by the conserved multiplicative noise that typically appears in the Dean-Kawasaki-type description. We find that this noise enhances front propagation in systems with density-dependent diffusivity, accelerates the onset of pattern formation in particle systems with nonlocal interactions, and reduces hysteresis in systems interacting via repulsive forces. In some cases, it accelerates transitions or induces structures absent in deterministic models. These findings illustrate that (conservative) fluctuations can have constructive and nontrivial effects, emphasizing the importance of stochastic modeling in understanding collective particle dynamics."

Most studies so far have focused on low-$Q$ solitons ($|Q| \\leq 1$), such as skyrmions, bimerons, and vortices. Here, we present the first calculations of the lifetimes of high-$Q$ bimerons and demonstrate that they are fundamentally more stable than high-$Q$ skyrmions over a wide range of temperature. To obtain realistic results, our chosen system is an experimentally feasible van der Waals interface, Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. We show that the lifetimes of high-$Q$ (anti)bimerons can exceed the lifetime of those with $|Q|=1$ by 3 orders of magnitude. Remarkably, this trend remains valid even when extrapolated to room temperature (RT), as the lifetimes are dominated by entropy rather than energy barriers. This contrasts with high-$Q$ skyrmions, whose lifetimes fall with $|Q|$ near RT. We attribute this fundamental difference between skyrmions and bimerons to their distinct magnetic texture symmetries, which lead to different entropy-dominated lifetimes."

Distinct thermodynamic features differentiate ALLPS from SLLPS: (1) in ALLPS, polymers co-concentrate within a single dense phase coexisting with a solvent-rich phase, whereas in SLLPS each polymer forms a separate phase; (2) the attractive interaction per monomer in ALLPS is strongly dependent on solvent quality, but solvent-independent in SLLPS; and (3) ALLPS binodals exhibit near-universal behavior, largely independent of solvent content. SCF results further show that interfacial tension increases and interfacial width decreases with distance from the CP. We provide scaling relations for both quantities are provided. Compared with SLLPS, ALLPS displays higher interfacial tension and a thinner interface, reflecting distinct molecular organization at the liquid-liquid boundary."

By incorporating the noise-induced statistical correlations between the quasiparticles, we extend this description to the full-time probability distribution of the entanglement entropy. Our generalized quasiparticle picture allows us to compute the average time evolution of a generic function of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem.

Although operating near a quantum critical point (QCP) is known to enhance engine performance, the precise thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot efficiency limit remain unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the low-temperature regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the net work output is given by $ W = k_B \\delta \\ln (g_{\\text{crit}}/g_0) $ with $ \\delta = T_H - T_L $, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency $ \\eta_C = 1 - T_L/T_H $, independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency only with a perfect regenerator, here no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the thermal population remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear quantum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate this universal result by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems, including spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively, which converges to classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This analysis establishes a general and robust foundation for designing quantum thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering finite work."

      "summary": "This study investigates the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, driven by structural randomness that effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. Given this unusual situation, it is essential to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. To perform this study, a minimal model for disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, is analyzed using a formulation of gauge mean-field theory (GMFT) directly in real space. This approach allows the inclusion of disorder effects exactly and provides access to non-perturbative effects. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. Moreover, the Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations appears tiny and restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the uniqueness of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart."

Such systems are typically characterized by power-law correlations and universality, and are studied using the powerful framework of the renormalization group (RG). Intriguingly, power laws and weak forms of universality also pervade real-world datasets and deep learning models, motivating the application of RG ideas to the analysis of deep learning. In this work, we develop an RG framework to analyze self-similarity and its breakdown in learning curves for a class of weakly non-linear (non-lazy) neural networks trained on power-law distributed data. Features often neglected in standard treatments -- such as spectrum discreteness and lack of translation invariance -- lead to both quantitative and qualitative departures from conventional perturbative RG. In particular, we find that the concept of scaling intervals naturally replaces that of scaling dimensions. Despite these differences, the framework retains key RG features: it enables the classification of perturbations as relevant or irrelevant, and reveals a form of universality at large data limits, governed by a Gaussian Process-like UV fixed point."

We demonstrate this approach using condensation in a Lennard-Jones truncated and shifted fluid as an example, showing an excellent agreement with previous Umbrella Sampling simulations. The method is straightforward to implement, computationally inexpensive, requires only a small number of particles comparable to the critical cluster size, does not rely on the use of Classical Nucleation Theory, and does not require any cluster definition or reaction coordinate. All of these advantages hold the promise of opening the door to simulate nucleation processes in complex molecules of atmospheric, chemical or pharmaceutical interest that cannot be easily simulated with current techniques."

This system is electrically neutral, thus its coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid. We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires, showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical oscillators with currents."

In this study, we investigate the adsorption behavior and tribochemical stability of three additives: Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), and Amine Neutralized Acid Phosphate (ANAP). These additives are studied on iron and hematite surfaces using both ab initio calculations and experimental analyses on steel. Simulations revealed that ANAP exhibited the strongest adsorption on iron, followed by DBHP, while OAP showed weaker interactions, though its chemisorption was enhanced on hematite via hydrogen loss. Under tribological conditions, the DBHP phosphite dissociated more readily than the other two phosphates molecules due to its lower phosphorus coordination, as confirmed by bond order analysis. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements indicated significant differences in adsorption behavior across temperatures, with DBHP forming stable deposits, while ANAP exhibited poor retention, in agreement with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed DBHP's strong chemisorption and molecular dissociation, leading to increased phosphorus deposition. OAP, despite forming a phosphorus-based layer, caused a reduction in Fe oxide, consistent with its hydrogen release mechanism observed in simulations. These findings highlight the critical role of molecular structure and oxidation state in tribofilm formation and stability. Understanding these interactions at the atomic level provides valuable insights for designing high-performance lubricant additives for extreme operating conditions."

Here, we report a strong longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) in antiferromagnetic V2O3 thin films. The LSSE response at cryogenic temperatures increases as a function of the external magnetic field until it approaches saturation. The response at given power and field exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, with a pronounced peak that shifts toward higher temperatures as the field increases. Furthermore, the magnitude of the LSSE signal decreases consistently with increasing thickness, implying that the bulk SSE dominates any interfacial contribution. This negative correlation between the SSE and the thickness implies that the magnon energy relaxation length in V2O3 is shorter than the thickness of our thinnest film, 50 nm, consistent with the strong spin-lattice coupling in this material."

Cooper pairing in the recently discovered KTO-based heterostructures has been proposed to be mediated by the soft TO mode.

The coupling to the soft TO mode is by far the largest, with comparable contributions from both intraband and interband processes. Remarkably, we find that for this mode, spin-non-conserving matrix elements are particularly relevant. We develop a three-band microscopic model with spin-orbit coupled $t_{2g}$ orbitals that reproduces the main features of the ab initio results. For the highest energy band, the coupling can be understood as a \"dynamical\" isotropic Rashba effect. In contrast, for the two lowest bands, the Rashba-like coupling becomes strongly anisotropic. The DFPT protocol implemented here enables the calculation of the full electron-phonon coupling matrix projected onto any mode of interest, and it is easily applicable to other systems."

      "summary": "Optical gain is a critical process in today's semiconductor technology and it is most often achieved via stimulated emission. In this theoretical study, we find a resonant TE mode in biased low-symmetry two-dimensional metallic systems which may lead to optical gain in the absence of stimulated emission. We do so by first modeling the optical conductivity using Boltzmann non-equilibrium transport theory and then simulating the scattering problem using a scattered-wave formalism. Assuming that the system may possess a Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and a non-zero Magnetoelectric tensor (MET), we find that the optical conductivity has a non-trivial dependence on the direction of the applied bias, which allows for probing the TE mode. After analyzing the system with one of each of the effects, we find that the resonant TE mode is only accessible when both effects are present. Further studies are necessary to find materials with a suitably large BCD and MET, in order to realize the predictions within this study."

      "summary": "A common method for reading out the state of a spin qubit is by latching one logical qubit state, either $|1\\rangle$ or $|0\\rangle$, onto a different, metastable charge state. Such a latched state can provide a superior charge sensing signal for qubit readout, and it can have a lifetime chosen to be long enough that the charge sensed readout can be high fidelity. However, the passive reset out of latched states is inherently long, which is not desirable. In this work, we demonstrate an on-demand, high fidelity (> 99%) re-initialization of a quantum dot qubit out of a latched readout state. The method is simple to apply as it involves a single baseband voltage pulse to a specific region in the quantum dot stability diagram where the relaxation time from the latched state to the ground state is over 50 times faster. We describe the mechanism for the reset process as well as the boundaries for the optimal reset region in the qubit gate voltage space."

      "summary": "Hydrogen hydrates (HH) are a unique class of materials composed of hydrogen molecules confined within crystalline water frameworks. Among their multiple phases, the filled ice structures, particularly the cubic C2 phase, exhibit exceptionally strong host-guest interactions due to ultra-short H2-H2O distances and a 1:1 stoichiometry leading to two interpenetrated identical diamond-like sublattices, one comprised of water molecules, the other of hydrogen molecules. At high pressures, nuclear quantum effects involving both hydrogen molecules and the water lattice become dominant, giving rise to a dual-lattice quantum system. In this work, we explore the sequence of pressure- and temperature-driven phase transitions in HH, focusing on the interplay between molecular rotation, orientational ordering, lattice symmetry breaking and hydrogen bond symmetrization. Using a combination of computational modeling based on classical and path-integral molecular dynamics, quantum embedding, and high pressure experiments, including Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction at low temperatures and high pressures, we identify signatures of quantum-induced ordering and structural transformations in the C2 phase. Our findings reveal that orientational ordering in HH occurs at much lower pressures than in solid hydrogen, by inducing structural changes in the water network and enhancing the coupling of water and hydrogen dynamics. This work provides new insights into the quantum behavior of hydrogen under extreme mechanochemical confinement and establishes hydrogen-filled ices as a promising platform for the design of hydrogen-rich quantum materials."

This extreme sub-thermal photoemission signal is consistent with direct emission of electrons photoexcited from the Fe dopant states into the low effective mass and positive electron affinity primary conduction band, and it is superimposed on a stronger signal with a larger MTE associated with an (optical)phonon-mediated momentum resonant Franck-Condon (FC) emission process from a thermally populated and negative electron affinity upper conduction band. For photon energies above 4.5eV, a transition from a long to a short transport regime is forced by an absorption depth reduction to below 100nm and both MTE signals exhibit spectral trends consistent with phonon-mediated FC emission if the polaron formation self-energy is included in the initial photoexcited electron thermalization."

      "summary": "The pursuit of universal governing principles is a foundational endeavor in physics, driving breakthroughs from thermodynamics to general relativity and quantum mechanics. In 1951, Wigner introduced the concept of a statistical description of energy levels of heavy atoms, which led to the rise of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) in physics. The theory successfully captured spectral properties across a wide range of atomic systems, circumventing the complexities of quantum many-body interactions. Rooted in the fundamental principles of stochasticity and symmetry, RMT has since found applications and revealed universal laws in diverse physical contexts, from quantum field theory to disordered systems and wireless communications. A particularly compelling application arises in describing the mathematical structure of the many-body wavefunction of non-interacting Fermi gases, which underpins a complex spatial organization driven by Pauli's exclusion principle. However, experimental validation of the counting statistics predicted in such systems has remained elusive. Here, we probe at the single-atom level ultracold atomic Fermi gases made of two interacting spin states, obtaining direct access to their counting statistics in situ. Our measurements show that, while the system is strongly attractive, each spin-component is extremely well described by RMT predictions based on Fredholm determinants. Our results constitutes the first experimental validation of the Fermi-sphere point process through the lens of RMT, and establishes its relevance for strongly-interacting systems."

In the wet regime, this exponent is $3/2$ as expected. In the nonwetting gap of the model, the exponent is again $3/2$, except for the approach to the critical endpoint on the neutral line where $\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\sigma_{\\alpha\\gamma}$.

      "summary": "Recent laboratory experiments suggest an intrinsic asymmetry between heating and cooling, with heating occurring more efficiently. Two decades earlier, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations had examined a related setup - heating one side of a computational cell while cooling the other via distinct thermostats. We revisit those calculations, recapitulating the underlying theory and showing that earlier MD results already hinted at the observed laboratory asymmetry. Recent realizations of a simple two-dimensional single-particle model, thermostatted in $x$ and $y$ at different temperatures, reproduces key features: at equilibrium, thermostat variables were identical, but under nonequilibrium conditions, the heating variable is weaker than the cooling one. At the same time, MD simulations from four decades ago by Evans and Holian reported a surprising skew in the Nose--Hoover thermostat variable $\\xi$ under equilibrium - indicating a statistical bias in energy injection versus extraction. We revisit those results with exact reproduction of their setup. We show that when (1) the center-of-mass velocity is set to zero, (2) integration is done carefully with finite differencing, and (3) sampling is sufficiently long, the distribution of $\\xi$ is symmetric and Gaussian with zero mean, as predicted by theory and validated by two independent error estimates. However, in the two-temperature cell, the distribution of thermostat variables become asymmetric, the cold bath requires significantly stronger damping than the hot bath requires anti-damping, with $\\langle \\xi_x \\rangle / \\langle \\xi_y \\rangle = -T_y/T_x$. This exact analytic relation links thermostat effort to thermal bias and the negative rate of change in the entropy of the system. These results identify the microscopic origin of heating-cooling asymmetry as a genuine nonequilibrium effect, consistent with experimental findings."

      "summary": "ZBLAN glass is a promising material for infrared optical fibers due to its wide transmission window and low theoretical attenuation. However, its strong tendency to crystallize during processing limits optical performance. While microgravity environments have been shown to suppress crystallization, the role of mechanical vibration under normal gravity conditions remains poorly understood. This study systematically investigates the influence of vibration on the crystallization behavior of ZBLAN using a controlled heating and vibration apparatus. Samples were subjected to varied thermal and vibrational conditions, and their crystallization onset and morphological evolution were examined through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results show that vibration reduces the crystallization onset temperature, indicating enhanced atomic mobility and nucleation kinetics. Progressive morphological transitions from needle-like to bow-tie and feather-like crystals were observed with increasing temperature and vibration intensity. Surface roughness analysis corroborates these findings, revealing a significant increase in nanoscale roughness in crystallized regions. Although brief exposure duration and partial thermal decoupling introduced variability among samples, the overall results confirm that vibration acts as a direct facilitator of nucleation rather than a purely thermal effect. This work provides new insight into vibration-induced crystallization in fluoride glasses and establishes the experimental foundation for follow-up modeling and apparatus optimization studies under terrestrial and microgravity conditions."

These couplings depend on the relative orientation of $d$-vectors, analogous to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and $\\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism, leading to an effective \"pliability\" of the pairing order that competes with superfluid stiffness. Such couplings cannot originate from spin-orbit coupling; rather, they can arise, for example, when itinerant electrons are coupled to a local exchange field composed of frustrated spin moments. Using a $T$-matrix expansion, we show that coupling to a local exchange field leads to an effective tunneling of itinerant electrons that is dependent on the underlying spin configurations at the barrier between superconducting grains. Furthermore, Josephson tunneling through frustrated spin textures can produce a Josephson diode effect. The diode effect originates either from nonvanishing spin chirality in the barrier, or from antisymmetric Josephson coupling between noncollinear $d$-vectors, both of which break inversion and time-reversal symmetries."

For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of \"ideal\" (disorder free) overdoped cuprates."

However, there has not yet been a model based on three-terminal potentials that can quickly model the velocity saturation effect as well as the carrier concentration distribution and the electric field distribution inside the HEMT, which makes the existing models have to rely on a number of empirical parameters in the modelling process, which lacks the actual physical significance. In previous publications, models for the electric field, carrier concentration distribution based on the effective length of the gate were presented. In this paper, the model proposed in previous publications is improved to enable: (1) the calculation of the current Ids without relying on the Newton iterative method with fast simulation convergence behavior; (2) The Vdsat when the HEMT reaches saturation at different Vgo is redefined instead of using Vdsat = Vgo; (3) The expression of the v-E relationship is redefined relying on the different transport of carriers, which solves the problem of the large model error of the electric field distribution in the region below the gate, and makes the model's accuracy of the I-V characteristic further improved. The model was validated by characterising the I-V and E-V of the HEMT through TCAD simulation with RMSE below 5%."

These complementary approaches divide the design space: periodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent components, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in spatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric processes, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in superconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation between interacting tones. Applying this framework, I design a kinetic inductance TWPA with a novel phase-matching architecture, and a backward-pumped Josephson TWPA exploiting an ambidextrous i.e., right-left-handed transmission line."

      "summary": "The quality of high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) deposited films can often improve through the effective use of metal-ion acceleration, requiring precise measurements of time-of-flight (ToF). These measurements are commonly done using time- and energy-resolved mass spectrometry but require careful consideration of the transit time of ions inside. The transit time is typically calculated by considering the travel length in various parts of the spectrometer (e.g. from orifice to detector), but errors associated with these estimations can lead to nonphysical values in a HiPIMS process (e.g. negative ToFs). Here we report a practical approach to determine ion ToF experimentally, using a bipolar HiPIMS power supply to synchronize a gating pulse to the front-end of a HIDEN Analytical EQP-300 mass spectrometer, placed at the working distance. The ToF is measured by applying a +70 V bias to repel ions, and a 5 us gating pulse of 0 V to accept them. To prevent interference with the HiPIMS plasma, a grounded shield is placed in front of the mass-spec head with a variable slit-opening (0.5-3 mm). The effectiveness of the shielding is verified by Langmuir probe measurements, noting negligible shifts in plasma potential for a DC sputter discharge. The gate is then synchronized to a HiPIMS pulse and data collected at 5 us intervals by adjusting the pulse delay. Measurements of the time-of-flights of Ar+, Al+, Sc+, Y+, and W+ ions are presented; Al+ and Ar+ ions were also compared to ToF calculated using mass spectrometry flight tube equations."

      "summary": "We prove the existence of a phase transition in dimension $d>1$ in a continuum particle system interacting with a pair potential containing a modified attractive Kac potential of range $\\gamma^{-1}$, with $\\gamma>0$. This transition is \"close\", for small positive $\\gamma$, to the one proved previously by Lebowitz and Penrose in the van der Waals limit $\\gamma\\downarrow0$. It is of the type of the liquid-vapor transition observed when a fluid, like water, heated at constant pressure, boils at a given temperature. Previous results on phase transitions in continuum systems with stable potentials required the use of unphysical four-body interactions or special symmetries between the liquid and vapor. The pair interaction we consider is obtained by partitioning space into cubes of volume $\\gamma^{-d}$, and letting the Kac part of the pair potential be uniform in each cube and act only between adjacent cubes. The \"short-range\" part of the pair potential is quite general (in particular, it may or may not include a hard core), but restricted to act only between particles in the same cube. Our setup, the \"boxed particle model\", is a special case of a general \"spin\" system, for which we establish a first-order phase transition using reflection positivity and the Dobrushin--Shlosman criterion."

Our approach generalizes the Wang-Wen-Witten symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, building on two recent advances in the study of fermionic TQFTs and related homotopy theory. The first is the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. The second, which we develop further in a planned sequel to this paper, is a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups, closely paralleling techniques from cobordism theory. By integrating supercohomology and cobordism methods within the recently developed categorical framework of fusion 2-categories, we provide a concrete and systematic route to constructing fermionic TQFTs with specified anomalies, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between anomaly realization, cobordism, and higher-categorical structures."

In this work, we use reservoir engineering to induce non-reciprocal hopping and pairing in the fermionic Kitaev chain, and reveal the emergence of a pairing-induced phase transition. The two phases appear in the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Kitaev Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of correlations, separated by an exceptional point. In the non-reciprocal phase, dynamics are characterized by directionality and slow relaxation, and the steady state supports non-reciprocal density and spatial correlations. At strong pairing, we uncover an unexpected density wave phase, featuring short relaxation times, a modulation in particle occupation and strikingly different correlation spreading depending on pairing non-reciprocity. Our work highlights the non-trivial breakdown of non-reciprocity due to superconducting pairing and invites experimental investigation of non-reciprocal fermionic systems."

      "summary": "We present a unified field-theoretic framework for the dynamics of activity and connectivity in interacting neuronal systems. Building upon previous works, where a field approach to activity--connectivity dynamics, formation of collective states and effective fields of collective states were successively introduced, the present paper synthesizes and extends these results toward a general description of multiple hierarchical collective structures. Starting with the dynamical system representing collective states in terms of connections, activity levels, and internal frequencies, we analyze its stability, emphasizing the possibility of transitions between configurations. Then, turning to the field formalism of collective states, we extend this framework to include substructures (subobjects) participating in larger assemblies while retaining intrinsic properties. We define activation classes describing compatible or independent activity patterns between objects and subobjects, and study stability conditions arising from their alignment or mismatch. The global system is described as the collection of landscapes of coexisting and interacting collective states, each characterized both by continuous (activity, frequency) and discrete (class) variables. A corresponding field formalism is developed, with an action functional incorporating both internal dynamics and interaction terms. This nonlinear field model captures cascading transitions between collective states and the formation of composite structures, providing a coherent theoretical basis for emergent neuronal assemblies and their mutual couplings."

Hydrogen becomes strongly siderophilic above $\\sim$25 GPa but weakens beyond $\\sim$200 GPa, whereas helium remains lithophilic yet increasingly soluble in metal with pressure. Incorporating these trends into coupled structure-chemistry models suggests that majority of hydrogen and helium reside in planetary interiors, not atmospheres, with abundances strongly depending on planet mass. Such volatile exchange may influence the redox states of secondary atmospheres, longevity of primordial envelopes, predicted CHNOPS abundances, and emergence of helium-enriched atmospheres, while He 1083 nm and H Lyman-$\\alpha$ lines provide potential probes of atmosphere-interior exchange. These findings link atomic-scale interactions to planetary-scale observables, providing new constraints on the origins of Earth-to-Neptune-sized worlds."

At the core of the proposed framework is a generalized maximum-entropy principle that can describe the evolution of a mesoscopic physical system formed by an interconnected ensemble of analog elements, including devices that can be readily fabricated on standard integrated circuit technology. We show that the maximum-entropy state of this ensemble corresponds to a margin-propagation (MP) distribution and can be used for computing correlations and inner products as the ensemble's macroscopic properties. Furthermore, the limits of computational throughput and energy efficiency can be pushed by extending the framework to non-equilibrium or transient operating conditions, which we demonstrate using a proof-of-concept radio-frequency (RF) correlator integrated circuit fabricated in a 22 nm SOI CMOS process. The measured results show a compute efficiency greater than 2 Peta ($10^{15}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (PetaOPS/W) at 8-bit precision and greater than 0.8 Exa ($10^{18}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (ExaOPS/W) at 3-bit precision for RF data sampled at rates greater than 4 GS/s.

In Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023), a systematic and efficient strategy was introduced to encode multiple problems into a special unit-disk graph: the King's subgraph. However, King's subgraphs are not the optimal choice in two dimensions. Due to the power-law decay of Rydberg interaction strengths, the approximation to unit-disk graphs in real devices is poor, necessitating post-processing that lacks physical interpretability. In this work, we develop an encoding scheme that can universally encode computationally hard problems on triangular lattices, based on our innovative automated gadget search strategy. Numerical simulations demonstrate that quantum optimization on triangular lattices reduces independence-constraint violations by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to King's subgraphs, substantially alleviating the need for post-processing in experiments."

We call them NLIE I and II. The derivation of the equations, is based on T-Q relations given by the equivalent thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) formulation of the problem in the repulsive regime. Though the equations are derived in the repulsive regime at discrete values of the coupling constant, a straightforward analytical continuation ensures their validity within the whole repulsive regime of the theory. For the NLIE I formulation, appropriate analytical continuation makes the penetration into the attractive regime also possible. However, the magnitude of this penetration is restricted by the spin of the largest spin conserved charge contained in the Gibbs ensemble. Within their range of validity, these NLIE formulations provide efficient theoretical frameworks for computing expectation values of conserved charge densities, their associated currents, and vertex operators and their descendants, with respect to the generalized Gibbs ensemble."

Analysis of individual SiV$^-$ centers shows significant variation in polarizabilities between defects indicating that the polarizability strongly depends on local parameters like strain. The observed polarizabilities are 3-25 times larger than those of tin vacancy centers, which we attribute to valence band resonances that delocalize the $e_u$ wavefunctions. Photoluminescence excitation measurements reveal that optical linewidths increase moderately with applied electric field strength. Our results demonstrate that large electrical Stark shifts can overcome the inhomogeneous distribution of transition frequencies, representing a significant step toward scalable SiV$^-$-based quantum technologies such as quantum repeaters."

      "summary": "Spin-splitting induced in a conventional superconductor weakens superconductivity by destroying spin-singlet and creating spin-triplet Cooper pairs. We demonstrate theoretically that such an effect is also caused by an adjacent compensated antiferromagnet, which yields no net spin-splitting. We find that the antiferromagnet produces N\\'eel triplet Cooper pairs, whose pairing amplitude oscillates rapidly in space similar to the antiferromagnet's spin. The emergence of these unconventional Cooper pairs reduces the singlet pairs' amplitude, thereby lowering the superconducting critical temperature. We develop a quasiclassical Green's functions description of the system employing a two-sublattice framework. It successfully captures the rapid oscillations in the Cooper pairs' amplitude at the lattice spacing scale as well as their smooth variation on the larger coherence length scale. Employing the theoretical framework thus developed, we investigate this N\\'eel proximity effect in a superconductor/antiferromagnet bilayer as a function of interfacial exchange, disorder, and chemical potential, finding rich physics. Our findings also offer insights into experiments which have found a larger than expected suppression of superconductivity by an adjacent antiferromagnet."

      "summary": "Strange metals defy the quasiparticle description of conventional metals, exhibiting a linear in temperature ($T$-linear) resistivity in a broad temperature range. It has become increasingly clear that, together with $T$-linear resistivity, strange metals exhibit a characteristic response in strong magnetic fields, which might point to the quantum critical origin of the strange metal behavior. To explore the effects of strong magnetic fields on the dynamics of quantum fluctuations in a strange metal, here we report the thermodynamic study of electronic density of states on the Fermi surface in CeCoIn$_5$. Using ultrafast nanocalorimeters, we access the electronic density of states at low temperatures and high magnetic fields through two independent thermodynamic probes -- the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate and the electronic specific heat -- measured simultaneously on the same crystal. Both thermodynamic probes exhibit magnetic field and temperature competition, characteristic of quantum criticality, indicating that magnetic field acts as a cutoff for the dynamics of quantum critical fluctuations in CeCoIn$_5$. However, at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the electronic specific heat and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate cannot be understood solely in terms of a critical enhancement of the electronic density of states at the Fermi surface. This indicates that quantum criticality in CeCoIn$_5$ involves both local and itinerant fluctuating critical modes."

In particular, well-known Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states occur at magnetic impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors.

Analogously to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states the bound states in S/AF bilayers are spin split, but the spin of a particular bound state is determined by the sublattice to which the impurity belongs. The standard decay of the bound state LDOS is superimposed by atomic oscillations related to the staggered character of the exchange field in the host material and by another oscillating pattern produced by finite-momentum Neel triplet pairing generated at the impurity."

Moreover, in contrast to bosons and fermions that carry exchange statistics of $0$ and $\\pi$ respectively, these quasiparticles of FQH fluids, when braided around one another, can accumulate a Berry phase, which is a fractional multiple of $\\pi$. Deploying the spherical geometry, we numerically demonstrate that composite fermion particle (CFP) excitations in the Jain FQH states carry Abelian fractional statistics. Previously, the exchange statistics of CFPs were studied in the disk geometry, where the statistics get obscured due to a shift in the phase arising from the addition of another CFP, making its determination cumbersome without prior knowledge of the shift. We show that on the sphere this technical issue can be circumvented and the statistics of CFPs can be obtained more transparently. The ideas we present can be extended to determine the statistics of quasiparticles arising in certain non-Abelian partonic FQH states."

We demonstrate that strong disorder not only leads to a topological transition from the parity anomalous semimetal to a diffusive metal with non-quantized anomalous Hall conductance, but also induces the topological phase in a trivial insulating phase. Our calculations of the local density of states provide clear picture for the formation of a single gapless Dirac fermion, which emerges as the disorder strength increases. The half quantized Hall effect is attributed to the existence of the gapless Dirac cone. Our findings of disorder-induced parity anomalous semimetal and diffusive metal significantly advance our understanding of the disorder-driven topological phase transition in magnetic topological insulators, opening up new avenues for further exploration in the field of quantum materials."

In this study, we analyze the resistivity of infinite-layer nickelate Nd$_{0.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$NiO$_2$ based on a three-dimensional tight-binding model within the framework of the quasi-particle picture by applying linear response theory. We take account of the self-energy by the fluctuation-exchange approximation for the Ni orbital and the T-matrix approximation for an impurity effect on the Nd orbitals. We find that (i) the $T$-linear resistivity at low temperatures is derived from the spin fluctuations, and (ii) a negative and $T$-linear Seebeck coefficient is obtained. Therefore, NdNiO$_2$ behaves as a quasi-two-dimensional electron system, similar to CeCoIn$_5$."

However, the applicability and predictability of phase-field models are inherently limited by their ad hoc nature, and there is currently no version of this approach that enables truly first-principles predictive modeling of large-scale non-equilibrium processes. Here, we present a bottom-up framework that provides a route to the construction of mesoscopic phase-field models entirely based on atomistic information. Leveraging molecular coarse-graining, we describe the formulation of an order parameter-based free energy functional appropriate for a phase-field description via the enhanced sampling of rare events. We demonstrate our approach on ice nucleation dynamics, achieving a spatiotemporal scale-up of nearly $10^8$ times compared to the microscopic model. Our framework offers a unique approach for incorporating atomistic details into mesoscopic models and systematically bridges the gap between microscopic particle-based simulations and field-theoretic models."

It is rigorously shown that, within this class, the only integrable systems are those that have been solved by the Bethe ansatz method, and that all other systems are nonintegrable, in the sense that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. Here, \"nontrivial\" excludes quantities like the Hamiltonian or the total magnetization, and \"local\" refers to sums of operators that act only on sites within a finite distance. This result establishes the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and, consequently, demonstrates that the quantum many-body scars observed in this model emerge independently of any conservation laws of local quantities. Furthermore, we extend the proof of nonintegrability to more general spin-1 models that encompass anisotropic extensions of the bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian, and completely classify the integrability of generic Hamiltonians that possess translational symmetry, $U(1)$ symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and spin-flip symmetry. Our result accomplishes a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems."

In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks."

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of prescribed curvatures on a quasi-2D assembly of anisotropic patchy particles. By varying curvature and surface coverage, we uncover a rich geometric phase diagram, with curvature inducing ordered structures entirely absent on planar surfaces. Large spatial domains of ordered structures can contain hidden microdomains of orientational textures imprinted by the surface on the assembly. The dynamical landscape is also reshaped by surface curvature, with a glass-like state emerging at modest densities and high curvature. Changes to the symmetry of the surface curvature are found to result in distinct structures, including phases with mesoscale ordering. Our findings show that the coupling between surface curvature and particle geometry opens an unexplored space of morphologies and structures that can be exploited for material design."

Our approach relies on a Bayesian active learning workflow to efficiently train an accurate machine learning force field on density functional theory data. Our large-scale simulations provide direct indication that melting of SiC proceeds incongruently via decomposition into silicon-rich and carbon phases at high temperature and pressure. During cooling at high pressures, carbon nanoclusters nucleate and grow within the homogeneous molten liquid. During heating, the decomposed mixture reversibly transitions back into a homogeneous SiC liquid. The full pressure-temperature phase diagram of SiC is systematically constructed using MLMD simulations, providing new understanding of the nature of phases, resolving long-standing inconsistencies from previous experiments and yielding technologically relevant implications for processing and deposition of this material."

Within the higher-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, we find that there is no apparent finite-size boundary drift between the thermal phase and the many-body localized regime. We substantiate this observation by introducing the Van Vleck perturbation theory into the field of many-body localization. The appropriateness of this method rests largely on the peculiar Hilbert-space structure enabled by the particles' Bose statistics. The situation is reversed in the lower-energy section of the dynamical phase diagram, where the significant finite-size boundary drift pushes the putative many-body localized regime up to the greater disorder strengths. We utilize the algebraic projection method to make a connection linking the disordered Bose-Hubbard model in the lower-energy section to an intricate disordered spin chain model. This issue of the finite-size drift could hence be analogous to what happens in the disordered Heisenberg chain. Both trends might be traced back to the particles' intrinsic or emergent single-occupancy constraint like the spin-$1/2$, hard-core boson, or spinless fermion degrees of freedom."

      "summary": "Quantum materials combining magnetism and topological fermions are a key platform for low-energy electronics, spintronics, and quantum phases that break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Coupling a topological insulator to a magnetic material allows proximity magnetization with the potential to achieve these phases at elevated temperatures. One potential architecture for realizing QAHE at elevated temperature is a heterostructure comprising two single-septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with four-quintuple layer (4QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle. However, the origin of this gap has not yet been explicitly determined, as there are other non-magnetic mechanisms that have been shown to produce bandgaps in similar systems. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, the magnetic nature of the gap opening is investigated to demonstrates direct control of the spin state via small magnetic fields and confirm the magnetic origin of the gap through spin splitting and broken TRS. Furthermore, the hallmark chiral spin texture of non-magnetic topological insulators is preserved away from the {\\Gamma}-point, despite the large 72+/-10 meV exchange gap at the Dirac point. The robust magnetic gap and controllable spin texture hold significant promise for future technologies requiring both magnetic properties and topological protection."

      "summary": "Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein Condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, three-body loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for the extraction of the three-body loss rate coefficient $L_3$ and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths."

      "summary": "The Kondo screening of a localized magnetic moment crucially depends on the spectral properties of the electronic bath to which it is coupled. Unlike textbook examples, realistic systems as well as dynamical mean-field theory of correlated lattice models force us to explicitly consider sharp features in the hybridization function near the Fermi energy. A case currently under the spotlight is twisted bilayer graphene, where the hybridization function of the heavy-fermion-like bands to the itinerant ones displays a divergence. We clarify how this impacts the screening mechanisms by means of a toy model with a tunable $\\delta$-peak in the hybridization function, superimposed to a regular part. Our analysis unveils an unexpectedly big impact on the Kondo screening already for a parametrically small weight of the flat band in the bath."

      "summary": "Long wavelength dynamics of 1D Bose gases with repulsive contact interactions can be captured by Generalized HydroDynamics (GHD) which predicts the evolution of the local rapidity distribution. The latter corresponds to the momentum distribution of quasiparticles, which have infinite lifetime owing to the integrability of the system. Here we experimentally investigate the dynamics for an initial situation that is the junction of two semi-infinite systems in different stationary states, a protocol referred to as `bipartite quench' protocol. More precisely we realise the particular case where one half of the system is the vacuum state. We show that the evolution of the boundary density profile exhibits ballistic dynamics obeying the Euler hydrodynamic scaling. The boundary profiles are similar to the ones predicted with zero-temperature GHD in the quasi-BEC regime, with deviations due to non-zero entropy effects. We show that this protocol, provided the boundary profile is measured with infinite precision, permits to reconstruct the rapidity distribution of the initial state. For our data, we extract the initial rapidity distribution by fitting the boundary profile and we use a 3-parameter ansatz that goes beyond the thermal assumption. Finally, we investigate the local rapidity distribution inside the boundary profile, which, according to GHD, presents, on one side, features of zero-entropy states. The measured distribution shows the asymmetry predicted by GHD, although unelucidated deviations remain."

      "summary": "We seek an extension to Schrodinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. We find that a suitable hybrid between two leading approaches, the Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories, accomplishes this goal in a way that is consistent with Born's rule. Our theory posits that the Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schrodinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, which causes the wavefunction to eventually localizes. This proposed loss of ergodicity mechanism recasts one of the foundational postulate of quantum mechanics as a emergent feature and has important implications regarding the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing."

Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size."

Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport.

Performing extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we characterize the interplay between long-range dipolar interactions, field alignment, and self-propulsion. We find that the competition between activity (favoring bond breaking) and the field's orientational constraint (promoting bond formation) gives rise to a rich variety of self-assembled, actuated structures. At low to intermediate field strengths, disordered fluids composed of active chains and active percolated networks can emerge, whereas strong fields drive the formation of polarized columnar clusters. Counterintuitively, low activity levels significantly extend the range of field strengths over which percolated networks persist. This structural evolution manifests in the polarization response of strongly dipolar systems, which exhibit a transition from super-Langevin to sub-Langevin behavior with increasing activity, as a result of the coupling between structure formation and activity-induced bond breaking."

The Lindblad formalism is employed to couple the system to the environment. The quantum theoretical approach comprises differences in the effects of dephasing, originating from destructive interference of different wave vectors, and spin-lattice relaxation.

Traditional beyond-DFT approaches (e.g., hybrid functionals, GW) are prohibitively expensive for the large supercells needed to capture the extended, hydrogenic wavefunctions, while semi-local DFT underestimates band gaps and suffers from delocalization errors. We present a simple, practical protocol for shallow donors based on the DFT-1/2 approximate quasiparticle correction that maintains the computational cost of standard DFT and enables supercells up to thousands of atoms. This approach provides a straightforward and reproducible workflow that delivers reliable donor binding energies with minimal computational overhead. Applied to group-V donors in Si, Si:X (X= P, As, Sb, Bi), the method yields binding energies in close agreement with experiment. We found that, for Si:Bi, it is essential to include spin-orbit coupling to achieve near-experimental values with a difference of only $\\sim$ 4 meV. For arsenic, the method yields excellent agreement with experiment, with a difference of only ~0.3 meV. For antimony, the results match experiment to within ~5 meV, and for phosphorus, the deviation is within ~8 meV. Beyond its high accuracy, DFT-1/2 offers a significant practical advantage, providing a straightforward, reproducible, and transferable workflow that is less demanding than hybrid functional approaches while remaining fully generalizable to other shallow impurities in semiconductors."

Using representative 3d ferromagnets (Fe, Co, Ni) and Mn-based full Heusler compounds, we compute magnon dispersion relations directly from spin-spiral total energies and extract real-space Heisenberg exchange parameters via Fourier transformation. Curie temperatures are subsequently estimated within both the mean-field and random-phase approximations. The SC spin-spiral calculations yield exchange parameters and magnon spectra in excellent agreement with previous theoretical data, confirming their quantitative reliability across different classes of magnetic systems. In contrast, the MFT approach exhibits systematic quantitative deviations: it overestimates spin-spiral energies and exchange couplings in high-moment systems such as bcc Fe and the Mn-based Heuslers, while underestimating them in low-moment fcc Ni. The magnitude of these discrepancies increases strongly with magnetic moment size, exceeding several hundred percent in the high-moment compounds. These findings underscore the decisive role of self-consistency in accurately determining magnetic exchange parameters and provide practical guidance for future first-principles studies of spin interactions and excitations using the spin-spiral technique."

A key distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where $p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance $\\rho_{zz}(\\theta, \\phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band Hamiltonian. The results from the $\\text{FL}^*$ phase show good consistency with current experimental data. Conversely, the results for the SDW phase are highly sensitive to the ordering momentum along the $z$-direction. An ordering vector of $Q = (\\pi, \\pi, \\pi)$ yields predictions that starkly disagree with the experiment. The only possibility for agreement within the SDW scenario is to assume an ordering momentum of $Q = (\\pi, \\pi, 0)$. However, even in this specific case, the SDW scenario predicts a marginally smaller Yamaji angle at $\\phi=0$ than the FL* theory, and a second Yamaji peak near in-plane angle $\\phi = 45^\\circ$, which was not observed in the experiment. In reality, the N\\'eel ordering vector is likely uncorrelated between adjacent layers, so that there is no coherent interlayer transport of hole-pocket quasiparticles in the SDW scenario, and consequently no Yamaji effect. Our results support the FL* interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models."

      "summary": "The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors."

      "summary": "It is now well established that a laser pulse can demagnetize a ferromagnet. However, for a long time, it has not had an analytic theory because it falls into neither nonlinear optics (NLO) nor magnetism. Here we attempt to fill this gap by developing a nonlinear optical theory centered on the spin moment, instead of the more popular susceptibility. We first employ group theory to pin down the lowest order of the nonzero spin moment in a centrosymmetric system to be the second order, where the second-order density matrix contains four terms of sum frequency generation (SFG) and four terms of difference frequency generation (DFG). By tracing over the product of the density matrix and the spin matrix, we are now able to compute the light-induced spin moment. We apply our theory to FePt and FePd, two most popular magnetic recording materials with identical crystal and electronic structures. We find that the theory can clearly distinguish the difference between those two similar systems. Specifically, we show that FePt has a stronger light-induced spin moment than FePd, in agreement with our real-time ultrafast demagnetization simulation and the experimental results. Among all the possible NLO processes, DFGs produce the largest spin moment change, a manifestation of optical rectification. Our research lays a solid theoretical foundation for femtomagnetism, so the light-induced spin moment reduction can now be computed and compared among different systems, without time-consuming real-time calculations, representing a significant step forward."

      "summary": "Advances in quantum technologies are often limited by slow device characterization, complex tuning requirements, and scalability challenges. Spin qubits in electrostatically defined quantum dots provide a promising platform but are not exempt from these limitations. Simulations enhance our understanding of such devices, and in many cases, rapid feedback between measurements and simulations can guide the development of optimal design and control strategies. Here, we introduce a modular, graph-based simulator that acts as a digital surrogate for a semiconductor quantum dot device, where computationally expensive processes are accelerated using deep learning. We demonstrate its potential by estimating crosstalk effects between gate electrodes and applying these estimates to construct virtual gates in a quantum dot device. We validate our approach through comparison with experiments on a double quantum dot defined in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure. We envision that this simulation framework will advance semiconductor-based quantum technologies by enabling more efficient design, characterization, and control of complex devices."

The system is robust and versatile, as it generates a large RF field without compromising on the available optical access, and its central resonant frequency can be adjusted in situ.

Specifically, the torsional flexibility of the D-A dihedral angle and the dipole character of charge transfer states give rise to a distribution of TADF dynamics across the emitter ensemble. Here, we employ single molecule spectroscopy to access the photophysics of individual emitters, thus overcoming the limitations of ensemble averaging. Using photon correlation measurements and locally resolved spectral data from single D-A type TADF molecules embedded in host materials of different polarity and rigidity, we derive host-dependent characteristics and distributions in the TADF dynamics. These are directly linked to local conformational freedom and dielectric properties, offering new insight into host-emitter interactions and enabling rational design strategies for optimized host-emitter combinations in OLED applications."

This presents a novel approach to investigating the chiral phase transition in such systems. Among these, the quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states~(QMETTS) algorithm has recently attracted considerable interest. The massive Thirring model, which exhibits a variety of phenomena at low temperatures, includes both a chiral phase transition and a topologically non-trivial ground state. It therefore raises the intriguing question of whether its phase transition can be studied using a quantum simulation approach. In this study, the chiral phase transition of the massive Thirring model and its dual topological phase transition are studied using the QMETTS algorithm. Numerical results are obtained on a classical computer simulating circuit-based quantum computations. The results show that QMETTS is able to accurately reproduce the phase transition and thermodynamic properties of the massive Thirring model."

In recent years, various porous solid sorbents have drawn significant research interest as promising carbon capture materials. However, high synthesis cost, limited CO2 adsorption capacity, sluggish adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain major challenges for their practical implementation. Here, we present silk-nano-fibroin aerogels derived from natural mulberry silk as a sustainable, amine-rich, and support-free sorbent platform for energy-efficient CO2 capture. The aerogels exhibit a CO2 adsorption capacity competitive with state-of-the-art amino acid and amino acid ionic liquid-based solid sorbents. Thermogravimetric analysis confirms high thermal stability up to 250C, substantially higher than that of conventional amine sorbents, while complete sorbent regeneration occurs at only 60 C. Furthermore, the silk-nano-fibroin aerogels demonstrate rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, excellent multicycle stability, and full retention of CO2 adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Spectroscopic analyses (XPS, FTIR, Raman, and solid-state 13C NMR) confirm reversible CO2 chemisorption through intrinsic amine sites within the silk-fibroin backbone. Overall, this work establishes silk-nano-fibroin aerogels as a sustainable and low-cost route toward energy-efficient CO2 capture."

We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to induce transitions resonantly between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor. This allows for robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for various initial sensor preparations, including ground states and low- and high-correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition; with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. Our findings are presented for both linear and nonlinear response regimes and illustrated for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model."

We control and probe the dynamics of nanometer-scale spin spirals, and, by exploiting Hamiltonian engineering that enhances the microscopic symmetry of the interactions, we observe a disorder-resilient collective spin evolution.

We wish to know whether there are inherent limits for the costs of such phenomena, and common units in which those can be traded off against more familiar costs measured in terms of heat dissipation. We give this problem a concrete framing in the context of CRNs, for the problem of extracting a topologically restricted pathway from a larger distributed network, through activation of some reactions and selective elimination of others. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a NESS, and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we make use of their formal equivalence to electrical circuits. We prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. For small CRNs, we show how catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms can drastically alter pathway costs, enabling unfavorable pathways to become favorable and approach the cost of the hosting pathway. Our results provide insights into the thermodynamic principles governing open CRNs and offer a foundation for understanding the evolution of metabolic networks."

The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment.

We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\\gamma<\\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries.

Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow the realization of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most implementations of waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide coupling. Here, we study a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a high-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA), thus implementing a \\emph{giant atom} in a structured photonic environment. The non-local coupling produces interference with the CCA modes, selectively enhancing interaction with even and long-wavelength modes, while suppressing coupling to odd and short-wavelength modes. For a subset of symmetric, long-wavelength modes, we reach the superstrong coupling regime. In this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal strongly hybridized eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit participation at the frequency of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in agreement with theory. Time-domain measurements of the qubit dynamics show clear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings model, marked by the emergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking spatial inversion symmetry of the CCA, the qubit seeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left of the qubit, which we exploit to implement and characterize a directional photon-emission protocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode light--matter interaction in a structured photonic environment."

Within the epithelial layer arises a self-organized reticulum comprising two interpenetrating multiscale networks: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells embedded within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of these networks was found to be susceptible to specific mechanical and molecular stimuli. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that is well-captured by network theory, and implies self-organization and proximity to criticality. Thus, the findings demonstrate a completely new biological paradigm - reticular inhibition of proliferation (RIP)."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation, and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes offer the advantage of supporting fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates, yet their performance against realistic noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived, including a random 2-form $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \\approx 11\\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \\approx 2\\%$ against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements, establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors. Our results constitute a substantial advance towards assessing the practical performance of 3D topological codes. This contribution is timely and in high demand, as rapid hardware advancements are bringing complex codes into experimental reach. Moreover, our work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation and holds significant interest for quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics."

While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through model's \"specialisation\" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates. These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians. Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS."

      "summary": "The accurate calculation of Bloch state derivatives is numerically challenging yet indispensable for evaluating the quantum response functions, such as how materials interact with light. Here, the authors develop a band-resolved automatic differentiation approach for efficiently calculating quantum response properties, eliminating the need for manual analytical derivations and time-consuming full-band summation. This work incorporates the quantum response calculation into a broader paradigm of differentiable programming, unlocking new pathways for data-driven exploration and design of advanced quantum materials.
