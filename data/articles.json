      "summary": "Hydrogen-rich materials are the most promising candidates for high-temperature conventional superconductors under ambient pressure. Multinary hydrides have abundant structural configurations and are more promising to find high-temperature superconductors at ambient pressure, but searching for multinary materials in complex phase space is a great challenge. In this work, we used our developed AI search engine (InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. Several quaternary hydrides with high superconducting temperature~($T_c$) are predicted. In particular, the superconducting $T_c$ of K$_2$GaCuH$_6$ and K$_2$LiCuH$_6$ are calculated to be 68~K and 53~K under ambient pressure, respectively, which shows a significant enhancement in comparison with that of K$_2$CuH$_6$~($T_c$ $\\sim$ 16~K). We also find that intercalating atoms could cause phonon softening and induce more phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling. Hence, we propose that intercalating atoms is a feasible approach in searching for superconducting quaternary hydrides."

      "summary": "Controlling the optical properties of rare-earth ions in wide-bandgap semiconductors remains a major challenge in the development of next-generation photonic materials. Here, we show that external hydrostatic pressure modulates the structural characteristics of ZnO thin films and, in turn, tunes the optical emission behavior of embedded Eu3+ ions. By combining in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy under high-pressure conditions with first-principles calculations, we capture a pressure-induced phase transition from the hexagonal wurtzite to the cubic rocksalt structure near 10 GPa. This transformation is accompanied by complete quenching of the D0 - FJ Europium emissions near the transition threshold, followed by a partial recovery at higher pressures, likely associated with the emergence of structural disorder. Concurrently, the Stark components of the emission bands exhibit a redshift and significant broadening with increasing pressure, reflecting enhanced crystal field strength as interatomic distances decrease. Additional first-principles calculations support the observed pressure-induced shifts in the Eu-4f states and emphasize the influence of lattice symmetry on their electronic environment. These results show that hydrostatic pressure is an effective way to adjust the optical emissions of rare-earth ions by changing their symmetry and local environment, providing a basis for designing photonic devices and luminescent materials controlled by pressure."

      "summary": "Gutzwiller projections of non-interacting chiral topological phases are known to give rise to fractional, topologically ordered chiral phases. Here, we carry out a similar construction using two copies of non-interacting Euler insulators to produce a class of spinful interacting Euler models. To that end, we take advantage of the recently discovered exact representation of certain Euler insulators by a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) of bond dimension $D = 2$. The Gutzwiller projection can be implemented within the tensor network formalism, giving rise to a new PEPS of bond dimension $D = 4$. We, moreover, apply very recent state-of-the-art tensor network tools to evaluate these phases. In particular, we analyze its entanglement entropy scaling and find no topological correction to the area law, indicating that the state is not intrinsically topologically ordered. Its entanglement spectrum shows a clear cusp at momentum zero, similar to non-interacting Euler insulators, and the spectrum of the transfer operator indicates that the state is gapped, which could imply non-intrinsic topological features. Finally, the static structure factor displays Bragg peaks, indicating the simultaneous presence of local order."

      "summary": "Understanding how atoms collectively interact with light is not only important for fundamental science, but also crucial for designing light-matter interfaces in quantum technologies. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on arranging atoms in ordered arrays and using constructive (destructive) interference to enhance (suppress) the coupling to electromagnetic fields, thereby tailoring collective light-matter interactions. These studies have mainly focused on one- and two-dimensional arrays. However, only three-dimensional (3D) arrays can demonstrate destructive interference of coherent light scattering in all directions. This omnidirectional suppression of coherent light scattering in 3D atomic arrays has thus far not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we observe a strong reduction of light scattering in a 3D atomic array prepared in the form of a Mott insulator in optical lattices. The residual light scattering is shown to be caused by the delocalization of atoms, Raman scattering, and inelastic scattering associated with saturation. We also demonstrate how light scattering can be a sensitive probe for density fluctuations in many-body states in optical lattices, enabling us to characterize the superfluid-to-Mott insulator phase transition as well as defects generated by dynamical parameter ramps. The results of our work can be used to prepare subradiant states for photon storage and probe correlations for many-body systems in optical lattices."

      "summary": "Phase separation driven by nonequilibrium fluctuations is a hallmark of both living and synthetic active matter. Unlike equilibrium systems, where ordered states arise from the minimization of free energy, active systems are fueled by a constant injection of energy at the microscopic scale. The emergence of ordered phases in such driven systems challenges our conventional views of domain growth and interfacial structure. In this study, we investigate the coarsening of colloidal clusters in active liquids containing E. coli. Our experiments reveal that uniform dispersions of colloids and swimmers are inherently unstable, resulting in spontaneous phase separation characterized by fractal interfaces and unconventional kinetics. The correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamical scaling, with the size of colloidal domains growing as $t^{1/z}$, where $z \\sim 4$, in contrast to the well-known growth laws for thermal systems with a conserved order parameter. Furthermore, the structure factor exhibits non-Porod behavior, indicating domains with fractal interfaces. This non-Porod behavior also manifests itself as a cusp singularity in the correlation function. We elucidate our experimental findings using a scalar field theory in which the nonequilibrium fluctuations arising from swimmer activity are modeled as spatio-temporally correlated noise. This coarse-grained model, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and detailed balance, successfully reproduces key experimental observations. Furthermore, it reveals a fluctuating microphase separation, where the initial domain growth, following $t^{1/4}$ scaling, is eventually arrested, thereby shedding new light on the microscopic origins of unconventional phase separation of colloids in active liquids."

      "summary": "\\usepackage{iopams} Recent developments have revealed that symmetries need not form a group, but instead can be non-invertible. Here we use analytical arguments and numerical evidence to illuminate how spontaneous symmetry breaking of a non-invertible symmetry is similar yet distinct from ordinary, invertible, symmetry breaking. We consider one-dimensional chains of group-valued qudits, whose local Hilbert space is spanned by elements of a finite group $G$ (reducing to ordinary qubits when $G=\\mathbb{Z}_2$). We construct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose generators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is non-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per irrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order parameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have distinct entanglement patterns. We show that for each irrep of dimension greater than one the corresponding ground state exhibits string order, entanglement spectrum degeneracies, and has gapless edge modes on an open chain -- features usually associated with symmetry-protected topological order. Consequently, domain wall excitations behave as one-dimensional non-Abelian anyons with non-trivial internal Hilbert spaces and fusion rules. Our work identifies properties of non-invertible symmetry breaking that existing quantum hardware can probe."

However, how the superconductivity is established including superconducting fluctuations remains unclear. This study investigates the Nernst effect, which is sensitive to superconducting fluctuations, in ultrathin FeSe films on SrTiO3. Temperature dependence of Nernst signals in the normal state is similar to bulk FeSe, suggesting that the electrons of SrTiO3 are transferred only to a few layers near the FeSe/SrTiO3 interface. The Nernst effect caused by SC fluctuations was observed only below T ~ 1.2 Tconset within our measurement resolution, which is similar to other Fe chalcogenide systems. Our results suggest that the pseudogap in monolayer FeSe/STO possibly originates in other electronic states rather than superconductivity."

      "summary": "Chiral phonons, quantized lattice vibrations with circular polarization and non-zero angular momentum, offer new perspectives for phononic and quantum device engineering. Graphyne could be a promising candidate due to its unique lattice geometry, valley-structured electronic bands, and thermal transport capabilities. However, chiral phonons in graphyne remain unexplored owing to the existence of inversion ($\\mathscr{P}$) and time-reversal ($\\mathscr{T}$) symmetries. Herein, we have demonstrated the existence of chiral phonons in graphynes, achieved by breaking combined $\\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry through atomic-selective substitutional doping. We find that the B, N, dopants and ortho BN co-dopant in 6-6-12 and $\\gamma$-graphynes induce localized structural deformations. These deformations lift phonon degeneracies away from $\\Gamma$ point and give rise to circularly polarized vibrational modes. We further established a strong correlation between chiral phonon angular momentum and electron affinity of dopants. Electron-rich dopants increase local electron density which could enable chiral phonon modes to couple more effectively with electronic environment. This in turn increases phonon angular momentum, indicating potential role of electron-phonon interactions in angular momentum modulation of chiral phonons. Our prosposed approach provides a tunable route for controlling chiral phonon behavior, paving way for development of advanced phononic devices."

Using the property of the bound spectrum (upper bound) of the Morse potential, limited by the bond dissociation energy, we analytically derive the generalized partition function. We present results for both the high- and low-temperature limits. We propose the effective number of accessible states as a measure of nonextensivity. The calculation shows that the nonextensive framework further restricts the number of accessible states. We also derive the generalized internal energy and entropy and examine their dependence on temperature and the nonextensivity parameter \\( q \\). Numerical results confirm the strong effect of nonextensive behavior in the low-temperature regime (precisely low to moderate temperature), where the ratio of generalized internal energy and internal energy calculated from the Boltzmann Gibbs (BG) formula develops a nontrivial dip structure for \\( q < 1 \\). Moreover, the generalized specific heat shows the Schottky-type anomaly. We extend our study by deriving the specific heat of solids with BG and Tsallis statistics using the anharmonic energy levels of the Morse oscillator. This study suggests that the Morse oscillator is a solvable and physically meaningful testing ground for exploring the thermodynamics of quantum systems driven by nonextensive statistics, with implications for the vibrational properties of the non-equilibrium molecular thermodynamics (especially diatomic molecules)."

Migdal's minimal area rule of classical turbulence predicts that the probability density function of circulation around a closed contour is independent of the contour's shape. We verify the Migdal area rule for small loops with respect to the distance between the vortex and antivortex pairs and further characterize its universal breakdown for bigger loops. We further uncovered the nonequilibrium universality dictated by the KZM dynamics, which results in power-law scalings of the moments of the circulation statistics as a function of the quench time."

This perspective presents a systematic overview of recent advances in studying kagome metal Co3Sn2S2 achieved through scanning tunneling microscopy. We begin by introducing different methodologies for surface identification and propose using designer layer-selective chemical markers for conclusive surface identification. We then discuss the Berry curvature induced flat band orbital magnetism and the associated unconventional Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we explore boundary states arising from Weyl topology and analyze challenges in detecting Fermi arcs via quasiparticle interference patterns and in uncovering the topological aspect of the edge states. Finally, we review recent observations of spin-orbit-coupled quantum impurity states through spin-polarized tunneling spectroscopy, as well as their connection to Weyl topology and flat band magnetism. We also provide in-depth analysis and constructive comments on the limitations of the current research approach. This review highlights the critical role of scanning tunneling microscopy in unraveling the intricate interplay between topology, magnetism, and correlations at the atomic scale, and the methodology discussed here can be applied to study other topological quantum materials in general."

Owing to the small size of hydrogen atom and its unique interactions with the host metal, MHx is of broad interest in both fundamental science and technological applications. Determining where the hydrogen is located within the MHx, and whether it orders on the partially occupied interstitial sites is crucial for predicting and understanding the resultant physical and electronic properties of the hydride. Directly imaging hydrogen within a host material remains a major challenge due to its weak interaction with X-rays and electrons in conventional imaging techniques. Here, we employ electron ptychography, a scanning transmission electron microscopy technique, to image the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of H atoms in Palladium hydrides (PdHx) nanocubes, one of the most studied and industrially relevant MHx materials. We observe an unexpected one-dimensional superlattice ordering of hydrogen within the PdHx nanocubes and 3D hydrogen clustering in localized regions within PdHx nanocubes, revealing spatial heterogeneity in metal hydride nanoparticles previously inaccessible by other methods."

At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a > 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J<0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function."

      "summary": "We theoretically investigate current noise in metallic carbon nanotubes induced by electron-phonon scattering, focusing on the probability density function (PDF) of the current that characterizes the nonequilibrium steady state. Quantum transport simulations combined with analyses of higher-order statistical moments reveal that the PDF evolves continuously from a Gaussian distribution in the ballistic regime to a non-Gaussian gamma distribution in the diffusive regime. In the crossover regime, the PDF exhibits pronounced asymmetry, attributed to a statistical imbalance in the number of conduction pathways contributing to high- and low-current events. Furthermore, in the diffusive regime, we identify non-Markovian features arising from high-frequency resonances in the current noise, which dominate the asymptotic scaling behavior of the current variance."

      "summary": "We propose a mechanism to control the motion of magnetic Skyrmions through the generation of a Skyrmion number current. This current is induced and tuned by an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian that includes a Zeeman term arising from the interaction between the spin system and circularly polarized light. To capture the effect, we apply a first-order perturbation method to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, using a breathing Skyrmion ansatz based on the Belavin-Polyakov profile. This approach reveals that the time-dependent deformation of the Skyrmion boundary produces an anisotropic breathing mode, which in turn generates a nonzero Skyrmion number current. The resulting dynamics in momentum space form a limit cycle, whose characteristics depend solely on the external magnetic field amplitude, the Heisenberg exchange coupling, and the Gilbert damping constant. Our formulation not only clarifies the topological origin of optically driven Skyrmion motion but also points to Skyrmion number currents as a low-dissipation alternative to electric currents for efficient Skyrmion control."

While parameter-free methods such as Voronoi tessellation and the solid-angle nearest-neighbor (SANN) algorithm are effective in monodisperse systems, they become less reliable in mixtures with large size disparities. We introduce SANNR, a generalization of SANN that incorporates particle radii into the solid-angle criterion for robust, size-sensitive neighbor detection. We compare SANNR against Voronoi, Laguerre, and SANN in binary and size-disperse sphere mixtures. Using Wasserstein distance metrics, we show that SANNR closely matches size-aware Laguerre tessellation while preserving the geometric continuity of SANN. Applied to the crystallization of the complex AB$_{13}$ phase, SANNR improves detection of local bond-orientational order and better captures the emergence of global symmetry. SANNR thus offers a smooth, parameter-free, and extensible framework for neighbor detection in polydisperse and multicomponent systems."

      "summary": "Symmetry dictates the physical properties of materials. The symmetry of the Bravais lattice defines the set of points, lines, and planes over which sets of planewaves are degenerate, upon which atomic symmetry determines the interaction potentials which may lift such degeneracies. This results in wavefunctions which are single planewaves throughout the BZ, except in the vicinity of the removed degeneracies. As optical transitions between any two planewaves are forbidden, only regions of the Brillouin zone (BZ) near these lifted degeneracies contribute to optical properties. Application to optical response of Si and other semiconductors reveals that a single band transition, with only two planewaves, well describes their dielectric properties. Further, it provides a framework to understand non-linear optical response which is demonstrated to arise from higher order degeneracy existing along high symmetry lines/points of the BZ."

      "summary": "We investigate topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional electron system with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling driven by circularly polarized light. Within the Floquet framework, we demonstrate that light-matter interaction induces nontrivial band topology characterized by a quantized anomalous Hall response, with Chern insulating phases of C = 0, 1, and 3. These transitions are governed by gap closings at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, controlled by the intensity and energy of the incident light. Introducing a weak linear Rashba term displaces Dirac points in momentum space without modifying the topology, whereas a purely linear Rashba system remains topologically trivial (C = 0). When both linear and cubic Rashba couplings are finite, the linear term confines nonzero-Chern phases to narrow parameter windows. In contrast, incorporating a linear Dresselhaus term into the cubic Rashba system can trigger topological transitions even at small coupling strengths. These results clarify the interplay between distinct spin-orbit interactions in Floquet-engineered Chern insulators and offer experimentally relevant pathways for achieving light-controlled topological phases."

We show that the effect predicts thermal Hall conductivities that compare favorably with actual experimental observations across a variety of materials, reproducing both their temperature dependencies and magnitudes by assuming effective contact thicknesses on the order of 10$^{-2}$ of sample widths. It even reproduces the subtle differences in temperature dependencies between materials with high and low longitudinal thermal conductivity. Our study suggests the necessity of suppressing the bypass heat currents in thermal Hall measurements, which can be achieved by properly arranging the measurement configurations."

In this study, we address this problem by investigating topological superconductors hosting unpaired Majorana modes under the influence of environmental dissipative fields. Within the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad framework and the third quantization formalism, we establish a correspondence between equilibrium Majorana zero modes and non-equilibrium kinetic zero modes. We further derive a simple algebraic relation between the numbers of these excitations expressed in terms of hybridization between the single-particle wavefunctions and linear dissipative fields. Based on these findings, we propose a practical recipes how to stabilize degenerate steady states in topological superconductors through controlled dissipation engineering. To demonstrate their applicability, we implement our general framework in the BDI-class Kitaev chain with long-range hopping and pairing terms -- a system known to host a robust edge-localized Majorana modes."

In this work, we investigate the nature of these interactions by modelling long-range $f-f$ exchange mediated by itinerant $d$ electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism, employing a material-specific tight-binding Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles calculations. The magnetic susceptibility is derived from the spin-spin correlation function based on the random phase approximation. Our results demonstrate that Fermi-surface nesting alone cannot account for the experimentally observed magnetic modulation at the wave vector (1/3, 1/3, 0); however, incorporating appropriate antiferromagnetic exchange interactions among the $d$ electrons yields the correct propagation vector. The spin-texture analysis reveals a configuration that is close to a cycloidal spin structure, preserving combined glide and time-reversal symmetry, and reflecting an intricate competition between inter- and intra-sublattice interactions in SmAlSi."

We investigate suspensions of active particles that change chirality when neighbor density within their visual cone exceeds a threshold, a communication based non-reciprocal interaction akin to quorum sensing. Tuning the visual cone triggers programmable transitions: from disorder to phase separation to hyper-uniformity. Notably, phase separation triggers large-scale circulation, with robust edge currents persistently flowing around dense clusters, while particle distributions inside become effectively hyper-uniform. These are genuine non-reciprocal effects which occur even in the absence of steric interactions. Remarkably, in active-passive mixtures, only 5% quorum-sensing chiral particles suffice to induce collective circulation. Thus, simple perception-based rules can generate life-like order, offering design principles for programmable active materials and micro-robotic swarms."

Beyond the existing Hartree-Fock approximation and Ota-Giorgini-Stringari theory, retaining the anomalous densities throughout will provide a completely self-consistent thermodynamic description, requiring the combination of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation and the representative statistical ensemble. Comparing three approaches for predicting magnetic susceptibility, we highlight the role of anomalous densities in stabilizing superfluid mixtures. We further unveil that Feshbach coupling can either expand the regime of atomic and molecular superfluids, or induce a phase transition to a pure molecular superfluid, depending on their density ratio. Importantly, we show that thermal fluctuations will trigger a phase transition from stable to unstable mixtures, where anomalous densities can serve as distinct signatures for experimental observation."

Here we present a comprehensive implementation of quantum-corrected ASD into the Vampire software package, based on the open-system Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a quantum thermostat. Our implementation incorporates memory effects along with colored noise derived from quantum-mechanical considerations that improve the description of the equilibrium magnetization. We demonstrate excellent quantitative agreement with experimental magnetization curves for nickel and gadolinium across the full temperature range. Our results establish that incorporating quantum environmental effects and colored noise substantially enhances the predictive capabilities of ASD simulations, providing a robust framework for modeling temperature-dependent magnetic phenomena in localized moment magnetic systems."

On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system."

If this were amplitude modulation, a demodulation process is needed to extract the fluctuation features. We first square the wave packet, which corresponds to the electric current, and obtain the 1/f fluctuation in this current data. We further speculate that this wave packet, after demodulation by thresholding, triggers the time sequence of the nerve firing. In our model, this also shows 1/f fluctuations, which is quite robust."

Our results reveal that these global times display rich correlations, with a non-trivial dependence on the resetting rate $r$. Specifically, we find that (i) While $t_{o}$ and $t_{\\ell}^m$ are uncorrelated for any positive integer $m$, $t_{o}^2$ and $t_{\\ell}^m$ display anti-correlation; (ii) A positive correlation exists between $t_{o}$ and $t_{m}$, which decays toward zero following a logarithmically corrected power-law way with an exponent of $-2$ as $r \\to \\infty$; (iii) The correlation between $t_{m}$ and $t_{\\ell}$ shifts from positive to negative as $r$ increases.

In contrast to previously reported integration of MXene and hydrogels, the material described here offers a tunable porous structure for volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing that maintains its stability and responsiveness in any kind of gaseous environment and in a dried state. Furthermore, its synthesis is significantly simpler and more efficient compared to other studies on porous MXene composites. The presented study focuses on a fundamental investigation of the synthesized MXene/PNIPAAm composite's properties. Thereby, the fabrication and comparison of pure MXene and composite samples featuring either a compact or a highly porous three-dimensional microstructure, reveal unique properties with respect to: (i) controllable three-dimensional spatial arrangement of MXene instead of the prevalent stacked-sheet structure, (ii) reduction of oxidation-induced degradation of MXene and substantially enhanced stability over the course of three months, and (iii) tunable electronic states in response to gas interactions. Material characterization is conducted by scanning electron microscopy and rheology to assess the microstructural and mechanical properties, and in a chemiresistive measurement setup for determination of electrical properties and the evaluation of the composite's potential for VOC sensing in a gaseous environment with the test analyte acetone. These investigations reveal fundamentally novel material effects and properties that address some of the key MXene-related challenges. Additionally, the interplay between the MXene and the hydrogel enables unprecedented opportunities for enhancing the sensing potential of stimulus-responsive hydrogels, specifically in gaseous environments."

      "summary": "One-dimensional Bose gases present an interesting setting to study the physics of Bose polarons, as density fluctuations play an enhanced role due to reduced dimensionality. Theoretical descriptions of this system have predominantly relied on contact pseudopotentials to model the impurity-bath interaction, leading to unphysical results in the strongly coupled limit. In this work, we analytically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, using a square well potential instead of a zero-range potential, for the ground-state wave function of a static impurity. We compute perturbative corrections arising from infinitesimally slow impurity motion. The polaron energy and effective mass remain finite in the strongly coupled regime, in contrast to the divergent behavior obtained using a contact potential. Moreover, we provide a universal description in this limit characterized by the dimensionless ratio $\\bar{w} \\equiv w/\\xi$ between the interaction range $w$ of the impurity-bath potential and the coherence length $\\xi$ of the Bose gas. The effective mass exhibits a $1/ \\bar{w}$ scaling. The energy of the attractive polaron scales as $-1/\\bar{w}^3$, whereas the repulsive polaron features subleading corrections to the dark soliton energy at the order $\\bar{w}^3$."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnets offer unprecedented opportunities to control magnetism at the atomic scale. Through charge carrier doping - realized by electrostatic gating, intercalation/adsorption, or interfacial charge transfer - one can efficiently tune exchange interactions and spin-orbit-induced effects in these systems. In this work, through a multi-scale theoretical framework combining density functional theory, spin Hamiltonian modeling, and Wannier-function analysis, we choose monolayer CrI$_3$ to unravel how carrier doping affects the isotropic as well as anisotropic exchange interactions in this prototypical vdW ferromagnet. The remarkable efficiency of hole doping in enhancing ferromagnetic exchange and magnetic anisotropy found in our study was explained through orbital-resolved analysis. Crucially, we demonstrated that unlike the undoped system - where isotropic exchange interactions govern magnetic long-range order - the hole-doped CrI$_3$ exhibits anisotropic terms comparable in magnitude to isotropic ones. Finally, we show that a high concentration of holes in a CrI$_3$ monolayer can increase its Curie temperature above 200 K. This work advances our understanding of doping-controlled magnetism in semiconducting 2D materials, demonstrating how anisotropy engineering can stabilize high-temperature magnetic order."

      "summary": "The quantitative description of the electrical resistivity of a magnetic material remains challenging to this day. Qualitatively, it is well understood that the temperature-induced lattice and spin disorder determines the temperature dependence of the resistivity. While prior publications reached good agreement with experiment in the so-called supercell or direct approach for non-magnetic materials where the spin-disorder contribution to the resistivity is negligible, an accurate, purely theoretical description of magnetic materials remains elusive. This shortcoming can be attributed to the missing accuracy in the description of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder itself. In this work, we employ a joint approach from \\textit{ab-initio} transport calculations and atomistic modeling of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder. Using the example of $\\alpha$-Fe, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum mechanical effects using a semiclassical local quantization of the Heisenberg model significantly improves the description of the spin-disorder component to the electrical resistivity. Compared to previous approaches, this model includes the description of magnetic short-range order effects, enabling us to study temperature effects around and above the Curie temperature, where prior mean-field theory-based approaches inevitably predicted a constant contribution."

We implement the coarse-graining procedure using the Doi-Peliti field theory, which preserves microscopic noise effects on the meso/macro scale. The exact mapping reveals the key role played by Poissonian particle occupancy statistics. We show the implications of the exact coarse-graining method using a prototypical flocking model, namely the active Ising model, which exhibits a mismatch between the microscopic and macroscopic mean-field coarse-grained descriptions. Our analysis shows that the high- and low-density regimes are governed by two different coarse-grained equations. In the low-density regime, noise effects play a prominent role, leading to a first-order phase transition. In contrast, the second-order phase transition occurs in the high-density regime. Due to the exact coarse-graining methods, our framework also opens up applicability to systematically analyze noise-induced phase transitions in other models of reciprocally and non-reciprocally interacting particles."

This feature arises from spectral singularities known as exceptional points, whose realization in the spectrum typically requires fine-tuning of parameters. The design of such systems receives significant impetus from the recent conception of \\emph{exceptional deficiency}, in which the entire energy spectrum is composed of exceptional points. Here, we present a concrete and transparent mechanism that enforces exceptional deficiency through lattice sum rules in non-Hermitian topological square-root insulators. We identify the resulting dynamical signatures in static broadband amplification and non-Abelian adiabatic state amplification, differentiate between bulk and boundary effects, and outline routes to implementation in physical platforms"

Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy induced luminescence and density functional theory to study single vanadyl phthalocyanine molecules, which are stable neutral radicals. Two distinct adsorption geometries of the molecule on NaCl/Au(111) lead to a difference in the interaction of the unpaired electron with the substrate, which in turn allows us to investigate its effects on the light emission process. Remarkably, we observe that up-conversion electroluminescence is gated by the adsorption geometry of the molecule, an effect we attribute to a reordering of excited states and enhanced excited state transition probabilities. The profound influence of the unpaired electron via state reordering opens new possibilities for tuning not only molecular electroluminescence but also many other spin dependent phenomena."

They have been shown to exist in, among other systems, topological insulators and superconductors. Additionally in both one dimensional systems and two dimensional higher order topological matter a dynamical analogue of the bulk-boundary correspondence has been observed which is suggestive of a dynamical switching between different phases. If the time evolving Hamiltonian is topologically non-trivial, zeroes of the Loschmidt matrix appear between critical times, leading to significant, periodically occurring contributions to the boundary dynamical free energy. In this article we extend these ideas to two dimensional topological matter by showing that in-gap bands in the spectrum of the Loschmidt matrix between successive critical times exist if the time evolving Hamiltonian is topologically non-trivial. We further show that these in-gap bands are directly responsible for a boundary contribution to the dynamical free energy, thus establishing a dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence in two dimensional topological matter."

We employ the hybrid multiscale code XTANT-3 to simulate the kinetics of material response to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The code accounts for nonequilibrium electronic and atomic dynamics, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe exhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective threshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon coupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all materials show nonthermal melting at higher doses. Threshold doses increase further if energy sinks and recrystallization are included. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band gap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose increases, the cooled state becomes more amorphous, reducing the band gap until it stabilizes. Curiously, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibit transient superionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At 0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the surface occurs. The results suggest that femtosecond lasers may be used for tuning the band gap of photovoltaic semiconductors."

AlO$_x$ has long been regarded as the highest quality oxide tunnel barrier and is often used in niobium-based junctions. Here we propose ZrO$_x$ as an alternative tunnel barrier material for Nb electrodes. We theoretically estimate that zirconium oxide has excellent oxygen retention properties and experimentally verify that there is no significant oxygen diffusion leading to NbO$_x$ formation in the adjacent Nb electrode. We develop a top-down, subtractive fabrication process for Nb/Zr-ZrO$_x$/Nb Josephson junctions, which enables scalability and large-scale production of superconducting electronics. Using cross sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, we experimentally find that depending on the Zr thickness, ZrO$_x$ tunnel barriers can be fully crystalline with chemically abrupt interfaces with niobium. Further analysis using electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals that ZrO$_x$ corresponds to tetragonal ZrO$_2$. Room temperature characterization of fabricated junctions using Simmons' model shows that ZrO$_2$ exhibits a low tunnel barrier height, which is promising in merged-element transmon applications. Low temperature transport measurements reveal sub-gap structure, while the low-voltage sub-gap resistance remains in the megaohm range."

      "summary": "Using a parent Hermitian tight-binding model on a bipartite lattice with chiral symmetry, we theoretically generate non-Hermitian models for free fermions with $p$ orbitals per unit cell satisfying a complex generalization of chiral symmetry. The $p$ complex energy bands in $k$ space are given by a common $k$-dependent real factor, determined by the bands of the parent model, multiplied by the $p$th roots of unity. When the parent model is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the single-particle energy levels are the same as those of free parafermion solutions to Baxter's non-Hermitian clock model. This construction relies on fully unidirectional hopping to create Bloch Hamiltonians with the form of generalized permutation matrices, but we also describe the effect of partial unidirectional hopping. For fully bidirectional hopping, the Bloch Hamiltonians are Hermitian and may be separated into even and odd parity blocks with respect to inversion of the orbitals within the unit cell. Partially unidirectional hopping breaks the inversion symmetry and mixes the even and odd blocks, and the real energy spectrum evolves into a complex one as the degree of unidirectionality increases, with details determined by the topology of the parent model and the number of orbitals per unit cell, $p$. We describe this process in detail for $p=3$ and $p=4$ with the SSH model. We also apply our approach to graphene, and show that $AA$-stacked bilayer graphene evolves into a square root Hamiltonian of monolayer graphene with the introduction of unidirectional hopping. We show that higher-order exceptional points occur at edge states and solitons in the non-Hermitian SSH model, and at the Dirac point of non-Hermitian graphene."

      "summary": "The superconducting diode effect occurs in superconducting materials in which both spin and inversion symmetry are broken. The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries. Thus a Josephson junction interface with the left-handed structure on one side of the junction and the right-handed structure on the other should exhibit a diode effect. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of right-handed/left-handed and right-handed/right-handed devices fabricated from single crystals of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. A magnetic-field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in both devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $|I_{c-}|$, and we show evidence for a zero-field diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed device but not the right-handed/right-handed device. A maximum asymmetry of 5\\% is observed in both devices. We provide a few explanations for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in these devices."

This work presents a meta-analysis model, building upon a growing database of literature cost estimations and enabling dynamic investigation and comparison of hydrogen transportation chains under varying input scenarios. Also built into the framework is the evaluation of the impact of costing methodology and shipping fuel type. A convenient online interface allows to leverage increasing amounts of underlying cost data and assists users in gaining insight into generalized cost dynamics attributes. The method and toolbox are demonstrated via in-depth analysis of compressed hydrogen (GH2), liquefied hydrogen (LH2), dibenzyltoluene (LOHC) and ammonia as hydrogen carriers. Confined hydrogen clathrate hydrates are used as an example to demonstrate how one can deal with lower-TRL candidate technologies."

      "summary": "A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting -- characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance. This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT). In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\\mu$m per voxel resolution. A tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of 50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822 and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based structural analysis of composite preforms."

      "summary": "The development of porous polymeric membranes remains a labor-intensive process, often requiring extensive trial and error to identify optimal fabrication parameters. In this study, we present a fully automated platform for membrane fabrication and characterization via nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS). The system integrates automated solution preparation, blade casting, controlled immersion, and compression testing, allowing precise control over fabrication parameters such as polymer concentration and ambient humidity. The modular design allows parallel processing and reproducible handling of samples, reducing experimental time and increasing consistency. Compression testing is introduced as a sensitive mechanical characterization method for estimating membrane stiffness and as a proxy to infer porosity and intra-sample uniformity through automated analysis of stress-strain curves. As a proof of concept to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, NIPS was carried out with polysulfone, the green solvent PolarClean, and water as the polymer, solvent, and nonsolvent, respectively. Experiments conducted with the automated system reproduced expected effects of polymer concentration and ambient humidity on membrane properties, namely increased stiffness and uniformity with increasing polymer concentration and humidity variations in pore morphology and mechanical response. The developed automated platform supports high-throughput experimentation and is well-suited for integration into self-driving laboratory workflows, offering a scalable and reproducible foundation for data-driven optimization of porous polymeric membranes through NIPS."

      "summary": "Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in complex systems, observed across a wide range of natural and engineered contexts. The Kuramoto model provides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among coupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However, many real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be effectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that higher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state, making it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite enriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case. Through extensive numerical analysis of the higher-order Kuramoto model, we find that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against synchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it. This result is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained budget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation involving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on either interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the role of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to design principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems."

As quantum hardware progresses to push the boundaries of classical simulation, efficient and robust error mitigation methods are becoming increasingly important for producing accurate and reliable outputs. We introduce QESEM, a reliable, high-accuracy, characterization-based software implementing efficient, unbiased quasi-probabilistic error mitigation. We explain the innovative components underlying the operation of QESEM and demonstrate its capabilities in the largest utility-scale error mitigation experiment based on an unbiased method. This experiment simulates the kicked transverse field Ising model with far-from-Clifford parameters on an IBM Heron device. We further validate QESEM's versatility across arbitrary quantum circuits and devices through high-accuracy error-mitigated molecular VQE circuits executed on IBM Heron and IonQ trapped-ion devices. Compared with multiple variants of the widely used zero-noise extrapolation method, QESEM consistently achieves higher accuracy. These results mark a significant step forward in accuracy and reliability for running quantum circuits on devices available today across diverse algorithmic applications. Finally, we provide projections of QESEM's performance on near-term devices toward quantum advantage."

However, a potential unphysical solution issue recently reported by Rekkedal and co-workers (J. Chem. Phys. 139, 081101, 2013) has raised significant concerns regarding the general applicability of coupled-cluster-based RPA, particularly in small-gap systems where RPA is anticipated to outperform commonly employed second-order perturbation theory. In this work, we elucidate the underlying origin of the multi-solution issue in drCCD and develop both a practical criterion for validating drCCD solutions and improved preconditioners based on level shifting and regularized MP2 methods for stabilizing the iterative solution of the drCCD equation. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach through representative systems -- including molecules with stretched bonds, large conjugated systems, and metallic clusters -- where standard drCCD iteration encounters convergence difficulties. Furthermore, we extend our approach to various recently developed reduced-scaling drCCD-based RPA methods, thereby establishing a foundation for their stable application to large-scale problems. The extension of our approach to RPA with exchange, quasiparticle RPA, and particle-particle RPA is also discussed."

Specifically, we calculate the modifications to the Feynman propagator induced by the planar potential and analyze the interaction energy between a stationary point-like source and the potential, obtaining a general and exact expression. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions relating the field mass and the coupling constant to the external potential, the vacuum state becomes unstable, giving rise to a pair-creation phenomenon that resembles the Schwinger effect in quantum electrodynamics."

We compare numerical (COMSOL) and analytical extinction and scattering spectra for various particle shapes - rods, disks, prisms, bicones, and bipyramids - using both bulk and size-corrected dielectric functions. Size correction primarily causes broadening and a reduction in the plasmonic peaks. Still, the accuracy of analytical models is maintained for all shapes except sharp bicones, where MEM fails for both bulk and size-corrected dielectric functions. This failure arises from the strong localization of the plasmonic field near the sharp bicone tips. However, for realistic bicone models with nanometer-scale tip curvature, MEM performs well."

Relativistic motion causes the qubits to perceive frequency-dependent effective temperatures that are either hotter or colder than their respective reservoir temperature. We show that the relativistic temperature shift, perhaps the qubit velocity, can be harnessed as a thermodynamic resource to enhance the work output and the efficiency at maximum power of the heat engine. We derive a generalized second law for a heat engine with a moving working medium and demonstrate that it can exceed the standard Carnot bound defined by rest-frame temperatures."

The validity of the proposed Hamiltonian is demonstrated by state-of-the-art tensor network calculations, which can assess both the nature of the ground state as well as low-temperature thermodynamics, including the effects of a magnetic field. We provide theoretical support for a picture of a non-trivially correlated dimer ground state, which accounts for the appreciable reduction of the magnetic moment at high temperatures observed in experiment, thereby resolving a long-standing puzzle. We predict the static spin structure factor as well as the emergence of magnetisation plateaus at high values of an external magnetic field, explore the nature of the quantum states in them, and study their melting with increasing temperature."

In this work, we report additional peaks in the low-energy spectra of a $5d^1$ double perovskite, Ba$_2$CaReO$_6$, which cannot be explained by adopting a purely classical description of lattice vibrations. Instead, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that these spectroscopic signatures are characteristic of orbital-lattice entangled states in Ba$_2$CaReO$_6$. Crucially, both theory and experiment demonstrate that these quantum-entangled states persist to low temperatures, despite the onset of multipolar order."

These gains carry over to Krylov subspace methods, which can find low-lying eigenstates and simulate quantum time evolution while avoiding local minima and maintaining high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in MPS form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method using a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. Our algorithm is highly parallelizable and thus lends itself to large-scale HPC simulations."

      "summary": "The quench dynamics of systems exhibiting cooperative or almost competitive orders in equilibrium are explored using Ginzburg-Landau theory plus fluctuations. We show that when the renormalization of the free energy by fluctuations is taken into account, anisotropic stiffnesses and relaxation rates of the order parameters can lead to a stabilization of ordered states at transient free energy minima which are distinct from any (global or local) minima of the equilibrium free energy. This theory demonstrates that nonequilibrium fluctuations play a pivotal role in forming nonthermal orders. As nonthermal order and nonthermal fluctuations mutually stabilize each other over some time, this mechanism could be seen as a nonequilibrium variant of the order-by-disorder phenomenon. We discuss the potential relevance of these findings for systems with intertwined orders, such as superconductivity and density wave orders, relevant for high-temperature superconductors and the kagome metals, as well as for systems that show orbital ordering."

      "summary": "Many efforts have been made in the past decade to realize topological superconductivity using superconducting proximity effect, but an ideal platform is still lacking. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform which gives rise to a topological phase that is robust against disorder. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading magnetic flux $\\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We theoretically show that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase occurs periodically for a wide range of $\\Phi$, independently of the chemical potential. Our experiment found that a TI device of this structure indeed behaves as a columnar nano-SQUID where the supercurrent flows only through the top and bottom surfaces with vanishing bulk contribution. Furthermore, the top/bottom asymmetry can be tuned by a back gate, a key ingredient for the topological phase."

We provide a comprehensive review of the developments to date in experimental and theoretical studies of the supersolid phases of bosons, with a particular focus on their observation in ultracold atomic gases. Additionally, the use of optical lattices facilitates the realization of `lattice-supersolids', which paves the way to study the effect of correlations in a controlled manner. A brief theoretical framework is presented to characterize this puzzling state with competing orders and to gain insight into its basic properties. Various types of supersolid phases and the different platforms used to achieve them are described. Finally, we discuss the future prospects of research and the potential to achieve supersolids with more exotic features."

By introducing alternating repulsive and attractive interactions on consecutive bonds, we show that the system undergoes a transition from a bond-ordered (BO) phase to a charge-density wave-II (CDW-II) phase as the attractive interaction strength increases at a fixed repulsive interaction. For a specific interaction pattern, the BO phase exhibits topological properties, which vanish when the pattern is altered, leading to a transition from a topological BO phase to a trivial BO phase through a gap-closing point where both interactions vanish. We identify these phases using a combination of order parameters, topological invariants, edge-state analysis and Thouless charge pumping. By extending our analysis beyond half-filling, we explore the phase diagram across all densities and identify the superfluid (SF) and the pair-superfluid (PSF) phases, characterized by single-particle and bound-pair excitations at incommensurate densities. The proposed model is experimentally realizable in platforms such as Rydberg excited or ultracold atoms in optical lattices, offering a versatile framework to study such interplay between topology and interactions in low-dimensional systems."

We analyze the friction kernel, revealing power-law tails in the weak coupling limit and exponential decay in the strong coupling regime. Due to the interplay between bath interactions, probe-bath coupling, and activity, the mean squared displacement, velocity, and stationary velocity correlations exhibit different dynamical regimes, which we characterize analytically. Under harmonic confinement, we find that energy equipartition holds at low activity but breaks down at higher activity, with the kinetic energy exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the activity of the bath."

Moreover, it highlights the relevance of energy damping, the number-conserving scattering between thermal and coherent atoms. We analyze the equilibrium properties and near-equilibrium relaxation of a homogeneous BEC in one, two and three dimensions at high phase-space density, and calculate the autocorrelation function and power spectrum of the density and phase fluctuations. Simulations of the full non-linear SPGPE are in close agreement, and extend our arguments beyond the linear regime.

      "summary": "Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm 2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the OFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off the transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology."

As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy.

While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases -- such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe -- topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the tetragonal $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using Topological Quantum Chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and temperature-induced structural changes lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe"

      "summary": "Any coarse-grained description of a nonequilibrium system should faithfully represent its latent irreversible degrees of freedom. However, standard dimensionality reduction methods typically prioritize accurate reconstruction over physical relevance. Here, we introduce a model-free approach to identify irreversible degrees of freedom in stochastic systems that are in a nonequilibrium steady state. Our method leverages the insight that a black-box classifier, trained to differentiate between forward and time-reversed trajectories, implicitly estimates the local entropy production rate. By parameterizing this classifier as a quadratic form of learned state representations, we obtain nonlinear embeddings of high-dimensional state-space dynamics, which we term Latent Embeddings of Nonequilibrium Systems (LENS). LENS effectively identifies low-dimensional irreversible flows and provides a scalable, learning-based strategy for estimating entropy production rates directly from high-dimensional time series data."

      "summary": "We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation."

      "summary": "We numerically study the dynamics of extended domain walls in homogeneous ferromagnets driven by a uniform magnetic field at zero temperature. Using both micromagnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and a collective-coordinate model, we show that flat domain walls become linearly unstable above the Walker breakdown field and below a higher threshold, provided their length exceeds a characteristic value. This instability is captured by a quasi-universal spectral diagram, parameterized solely by the Gilbert damping, that predicts the onset of deviations from rigid-wall behavior. Beyond the linear regime, large domain walls with bands of unstable modes exhibit spatiotemporal chaos, intricate Bloch line motion, and deterministic roughening. The system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from a flat to a rough moving phase at a critical field."

This point of view leads us to the grand-canonical framework and the need for a chemical potential. The dynamics is played by the shift acting on the set of sequences $\\Omega := \\mathcal{A}^\\mathbb{N}$, where the alphabet is $\\mathcal{A} := \\{1,2,...,r\\}$. Introducing new variables like the number of particles $N$ and the chemical potential $\\mu$, we adapt the concept of grand-canonical partition sum of thermodynamics of gases to a symbolic dynamical setting considering a Lipschitz family of potentials $% (A_N)_{N \\in \\mathbb{N}_0}$, $A_N:\\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Our main results will be obtained from adapting well-known properties of the Thermodynamic Formalism for IFS with weights to our setting. In this direction, we introduce the grand-canonical-Ruelle operator: $\\mathcal{L}_{\\beta, \\mu}(f)=g$, when, $\\beta>0,\\mu<0,$ and \\medskip $\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,g(x)= \\mathcal{L}_{\\beta, \\mu}(f) (x) =\\sum_{N \\in \\mathbb{N}_0} e^{\\beta \\, \\mu\\, N }\\, \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{A}} e^{- \\,\\beta\\, A_N(jx)} f(jx). $ \\medskip We show the existence of the main eigenvalue, an associated eigenfunction, and an eigenprobability for $\\mathcal{L}_{\\beta, \\mu}^*$. We can show the analytic dependence of the eigenvalue on the grand-canonical potential. Considering the concept of entropy for holonomic probabilities on $\\Omega\\times \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}_0}$, we relate these items with the variational problem of maximizing grand-canonical pressure. In another direction, in the appendix, we briefly digress on a possible interpretation of the concept of topological pressure as related to the gas pressure of gas thermodynamics."

Realizing Chern-Simons theory on lattice has been a problem of interest for decades, and over the years it has gradually become clear that there are two key points: 1) Some non-topological term, such as a Maxwell term, is necessary -- this is true even in the continuum, but more manifestly on the lattice; 2) the $\\text{U(1)}$ gauge field should be implemented in the Villainized form to retain its topological properties. Putting the two ideas together seriously, we show all interesting properties of a chiral Chern-Simons theory are reproduced in an explicitly regularized manner on the lattice. These include the bosonic and fermionic level quantization, the bulk and chiral edge spectrum, the Wilson loop flux attachment (with point-split framing or geometric framing depending on the Maxwell coupling), the Wilson loop spin, the ground state degeneracy, and, most non-trivially, the chiral gravitational anomaly."

In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Beyond reviewing necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect, we discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, stemming from the spectral topology, and show how skin states can be distinguished from topological boundary states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in one-dimensional non-interacting systems, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in many-body systems are highlighted. Lastly, experimental signatures and applications are discussed, and an outlook is provided."

We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions."

However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum."

A recent proposal in arXiv:2305.13606 simplifies this task by considering the soliton in a bounded region and relating the $\\eta$ invariant, and thus the fermion number, to a specific heat kernel coefficient and to contributions from the edge states. We test this method in a system of charged fermions living on an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex background. We show that the resulting $\\eta$ invariant does not depend on boundary conditions (within a certain class), thereby supporting the validity of the method. Our analysis reveals a nontrivial feature for the fermionic spectrum in the vortex-induced Higgs phase. As a by-product, we also find that for a vortex living on a disk, the edge states carry fractional charge."

Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective time-domain data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with 50 dB of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment that is seven times more expensive, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency (200 MHz vs. 80 MHz)."

However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four benchmark models -- a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -- demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of magnetic soft robots."

As such, the motion of an exciton cannot be described by the same Landau quantization that characterizes the motion of a free electron or hole in magnetic field. This contrast raises the question: How can a bound exciton state in magnetic field be expressed through the Landau quantization of its electron and hole components? Here, the authors establish a scattering selection rule between the Landau levels { n e , n h } of the electron and hole components, and identify an elegant pairing law between these Landau levels, n e = n h + l . The pairing law provides information on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number l , and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. [Phys.
