This configuration enables deeply distributed magnon modes and enhances magnetoelastic interactions with microwave phonons. As a result, the team observes clear formation of magnon polarons, manifested as pronounced avoided crossings in the spectra. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 064053] Published Fri Dec 19, 2025"

      "summary": "Orbital magnetization is established as the origin of the nonlinear Hall effect by deriving an explicit formula connecting the electric-field-induced orbital magnetization to the second-order nonlinear Hall conductivity. The applied electric field is shown to play dual roles in generating the nonlinear Hall effect by first generating a nonequilibrium orbital magnetization and then perturbing the associated edge states, and a unique nonlinear Hall effect is predicted in isotropic chiral metals driven by a noncollinear bichromatic electric field.

The transfer of angular momentum from the majority to the minority one allows for the determination of the superfluid fraction, which can then be compared with Leggett’s bounds evaluated solely from its density profile.
