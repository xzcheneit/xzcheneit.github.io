In this Letter the authors design a “Rashba spin valve” that uses the electric field to control the flow of electron spins, achieving a very high on-off ratio and operating without any magnetic elements, which drastically cuts its power needs and material requirements. The effect is strong and reliable, even in imperfect two-dimensional materials. These findings suggest a route toward creating ultralow-power spintronic devices that are controlled entirely by electricity. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, L041002] Published Mon Oct 06, 2025"

A sufficiently large temperature domain was found, where the superconducting order parameter is not vanishing. Corresponding to this, at the surprisingly high temperature limit, we obtain a narrow domain of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\\lambda_{\\rm eff}$, emphasizing the superconducting state. We discuss the localizing role of Hubbard-$U$ interaction and the effects external gate potential on the calculated physical parameters in the system. We explain the importance of the chemical potential in the formation of the superconducting state. We show the existence of a large superconducting band-gap in the system even in the case of the absence of the applied electric field potential."

Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \\emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \\emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale."

      "summary": "Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality."

Lattice relaxation produces four types of large-scale commensurate domains. The domains are characterized by the stacking of the three moir\\'e lattices and come in two types: Type-I \"Bernal\" stacking and Type-II \"rhombohedral\" stacking. Domain walls between adjacent stackings often host topologically protected edge states, forming networks at the supermoir\\'e and super-supermoir\\'e scales. Remarkably, all four moir\\'e substructures have narrow bands at the same magic angle $\\theta \\approx 2.3^\\circ$, allowing their correlated phases to be simultaneously targeted in device manufacturing.

Achieving a coherent and complete theoretical description of these fluctuations is a central challenge. We develop a general framework to quantify these finite-size effects in synchronization transitions of generic stochastic, globally-coupled nonlinear oscillators. By applying a center-manifold reduction to the nonlinear stochastic PDE for the single-oscillator distribution in finite systems, we derive a mesoscopic description that yields the complete time evolution of the order parameter in the form of a Langevin equation. In particular, this equation provides the first closed-form steady-state distribution of the order parameter, fully capturing finite-size effects. Free from integrability constraints and the celebrated Ott-Antonsen ansatz, our theory shows excellent agreement with simulations across diverse coupling functions and frequency distributions, demonstrating broad applicability. Strikingly, it surpasses recent approaches near criticality and in the incoherent phase, where finite-size fluctuations are most pronounced."

      "summary": "Altermagnets have zero net magnetization yet feature spin-split bands that host spin-polarized states. Here, we investigate how slow lattice vibrations (phonons) influence both the intrinsic and externally induced spin polarizations in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. For the induced spin polarizations, we employ a Rashba continuum model with electron-phonon coupling (EPC) treated at the static-Holstein level and analyze the spin Edelstein effect using the Kubo linear-response formalism. We find that moderate-to-strong EPC progressively suppresses the induced polarization via both intraband and interband channels, with a critical coupling marking the onset of complete spin Edelstein depolarization. The depolarization transition arises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split bands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete collapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the Rashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic. The presence of altermagnetism makes it anisotropic and breaks the conventional antisymmetry between spin susceptibilities that occurs with pure spin-orbit coupling, rendering the effect highly relevant for spintronic applications. We further investigate how the phonon coupling to the altermagnetic order, Rashba spin-orbit strength, and carrier doping collectively tune the depolarization transition. Our findings demonstrate that phonon scattering (e.g., through various substrates) offers a powerful means for on-demand control of spin polarization, enabling reversible switching between spin-polarized and depolarized states -- a key functionality for advancing spin logic architectures and optimizing next-generation spintronic devices."

We propose a multi-field approach to engineer spin polarization in $d$-wave altermagnets using gating, optical driving, and in-plane electric fields, which enable tunable and switchable polarizations along multiple directions. Optical driving induces out-of-plane ($z$) polarization, while gating and in-plane fields generate $x$- and $y$-polarizations via the Edelstein effect, all of which are experimentally detectable. We further find that spin- and band-selective doping induces chiral optical activity, a feature unique to altermagnets.

A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies."

The results extend the concept of active turbulence to solid systems and are expected to be important for understanding active biological solids, such as bacterial colonies and migrating epithelial monolayers."

We analyze the temperature and coupling-constant dependent properties of these two superconductors using a perturbative approach and a variational Hartree-Fock study. This reveals non-trivial spectra in the superconductors, which result from the fundamental building blocks being distinct from the usual Cooper pairs--in phase $(A)$, the elementary bosons are bound states of four electrons and, in phase $(B)$, of three electrons and a hole. This work complements the previous study [Nat. Commun. 15, 1713 (2024), arXiv:2301.01344], which focused on the properties of phase $(B)$."

Our goal is to show that quantum vacuum fields with both time reversal and space inversion symmetry breaking (so-called ME fields) can be observed in subwavelength regions of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The sources of ME fields are ME meta-atoms, subwavelength elements made of magnetic insulators, where the dynamical ME behavior is due to modulations and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization. The interaction between EM and ME systems occurs through virtual structures, ME virtual photons. Experimentally, ME quantum vacuum states can be detected in a microwave cavity.

To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials."

Vortex matter in superconductors is a model system to study this problem since imaging experiments have revealed that correlated disorder in the host media and finite size effects disrupt the hyperuniformity of the in-plane arrangement of vortices. Here we report simulations of layered interacting elastic lines as a model for the vortex lattice in three-dimensional superconductors, following a cooling protocol that closely mimics the experimental conditions. We show that finite-thickness effects limiting the hyperuniformity range arise both in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium.

Using a representative model swimmer, the learned map provides quantitative predictions for rotational and translational diffusivities and allows a linear-stability analysis of the isotropic state against polar ordering in dilute suspensions. The resulting predictions closely match direct simulations in the dilute regime. The present approach is model agnostic: once two-body collision data are available -- either from simulations or experiments -- the same surrogate can be used to perform these evaluations across dilute conditions, as long as two-body collision processes dominate. Because the workflow relies only on pre- and post-collision statistics, it can be applied directly to a wide range of biological and synthetic colloidal swimmer systems."

      "summary": "Continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD) has become the state-of-the-art theoretical approach for mesoscale dislocation plasticity of metals. Within this approach, there are multiple CDD theories that can all be derived from the principles of statistical mechanics. In these theories density-based measures are used to represent dislocation lines. Establishing these density measures requires some level of coarse graining with the result of losing track of some parts of the dislocation population due to cancellation in the tangent vectors of unaligned dislocations. The leading CDD theories either treat dislocations as nearly parallel or distributed locally over orientation space. The difference between these theories is a matter of the spatial resolution at which the definition of the relevant dislocation density field holds: for fine resolutions, single dislocations are resolved and there is no cancellation; for coarse resolutions, whole dislocation loops could contribute at a single point and there is complete cancellation. In the current work, a formulation of the resolution-dependent transition between these limits is presented in terms of the statistics of dislocation line orientation fluctuations about a local average line direction. From this formulation, a study of the orientation fluctuation behavior in intermediate resolution regimes is conducted. Two possible closure equations for truncating the moment sequence of the fluctuation distributions relating the two theories mentioned above are evaluated from data, the newly introduced line bundle closure and the previous standard maximum entropy closure relations. The line bundle closure relation is shown to be accurate for coarse-graining lengths up to half the dislocation spacing and the maximum entropy closure is found to poorly agree with the data at all coarse-graining lengths."

Correspondingly, an appreciable reduction in the magnetization below $T$=100 K further suggests partial Kondo screening of local moments active at low temperatures, explaining its effective spin magnetization state and upturn in its resistivity observed in experimental reports. We note a significant effect of Hund's induced spin-orbital selective incoherence in dictating the temperature evolution of its macroscopic observables e.g. spin-spin correlation function and effective local moment. Our results reveal a potentially distinct/new form of spin-dependent selectivity induced via Hund's coupling in addition to the conventional orbital-selectivity in the Hund's metals, as a plausible key mechanism in stabilizing their long-range magnetic order."

Specifically, we uncover that the intrinsic orbital and spin bilinear currents--responsible for the orbital and spin MNHEs--are governed by the quantum metric quadrupole and the Zeeman quantum metric dipole, respectively. In contrast, the extrinsic orbital and spin bilinear currents, which are linear in the relaxation time $\\tau$ and lead to the orbital and spin PHEs, are governed by the Berry curvature quadrupole and the Zeeman Berry curvature dipole, respectively. Counterintuitively, we find that the OHE due to the Lorentz force can also include an interband contribution from the quantum metric quadrupole.

Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs achieve comparable predictive accuracy while offering explicit symbolic representations of structure--property relationships. This dual capability enables both reliable predictions and the extraction of physically meaningful functional forms. Benchmarking against literature models further highlights the robustness and generalisability of the approach.

An example of such a nonlinear regime is a setup in which current is injected into the sample and the measured voltage drop is quadratic in the injected current.

This is the same symmetry condition as one needs to observe weak antilocalization, which can be prominent in two-dimensional systems. Here, we study the effects of weak (anti)localization on second-order nonlinear transport in two-dimensional systems using the semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We solve for quasiparticle distribution function up to the second order in the applied external electric field and calculate linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors for a toy model.

Core levels, valence band photoemission spectra together with DFT+DMFT spectral functions reveal insignificant change across $T_{C}$ indicating non-Stoner magnetism in (Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$. Our results provide a way forward to the understanding of complex interplay between electronic structure, exotic magnetism and heavy fermionic behavior leading to Kondo scenerio in 3$d$ vdW ferromagnets."

      "summary": "We report on the study of the magnetic excitations of Mott insulator La2CuO4 by using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and cluster calculations within the framework of exact diagonalization. Our results demonstrate experimentally that the bimagnon excitation in Cu L-edge RIXS is enhanced if the incident x-ray energy is slightly above the absorption edge. Through incident-energy-dependent momentum-resolved RIXS, we investigated the excitation of the bimagnon with predominantly A1 symmetry. The bimagnons of La2CuO4 exhibit a nearly flat dispersion with momentum along the Cu-O bond direction. This observation agrees with the bimagnon dispersion from the calculations on a single-band Hubbard model rather than a Heisenberg model with only the nearest neighbor exchange interaction. This means that the effect of the higher-order spin couplings such as the cyclic or ring exchange interactions caused by the coherent motion of electrons beyond nearest-neighbor sites is important for understanding the bimagnon dynamics of cuprates."

Disorder of the parent two-dimensional electron or hole gas is commonly estimated by the critical, percolation-driven density associated with the metal-insulator transition. However, a reliable estimation of the critical density within percolation theory is hindered by the need to measure conductivity with high precision at low carrier densities, where experiments are most difficult. Here, we connect experimentally percolation density and quantum Hall plateau width, in line with an earlier heuristic intuition, and offer an alternative method for characterizing semiconductor heterostructure disorder."

We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, and robust enforcement of boundary conditions.

      "summary": "Understanding the evolution of the physicochemical bulk properties during the Li deintercalation (charging) process is critical for optimizing battery cathode materials. In this study, we combine X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, and charge transfer multiplet (CTM) model simulations to investigate how hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3d and oxygen 2p orbitals evolves with Li deintercalation. Based on the presented approach combining theoretical calculations and experimental studies of pristine and deintercalated cathodes, two important problems of ion batteries can be addressed: i) the detailed electronic structure and involved changes with deintercalation providing information of the charge compensation mechanism, and ii) the precise experimental analysis of XPS data which are dominated by charge transfer coupled to final-state effects affecting the satellite structure. As main result for the investigated Li TM oxides, it can be concluded that the electron transfer coupled to the Li$^{+}$-ion migration does not follow a rigid band model but is modified due to changes in TM 3d and O 2p states hybridization. Furthermore, this integrated approach identifies the 2p XPS satellite peak intensity of TM as an effective indicator of the redox chemistry. With that the redox chemistry of cathodes can be deduced, thus offering a foundation for designing more efficient battery materials."

      "summary": "In stochastic processes with absorbing states, the quasi-stationary distribution provides valuable insights into the long-term behaviour prior to absorption. In this work, we revisit two well-established numerical methods for its computation. The first is an iterative algorithm for solving the non-linear equation that defines the quasi-stationary distribution. We generalise this technique to accommodate general Markov stochastic processes, either with discrete or continuous state space, and with multiple absorbing states. The second is a Monte Carlo method with resetting, for which we propose a novel single-trajectory approach that uses the trajectory's own history to perform resets after absorption. In addition to these methodological contributions, we provide a detailed analysis of implementation aspects for both methods. We also compare their accuracy and efficiency across a range of examples. The results indicate that the iterative algorithm is generally the preferred choice for problems with simple boundaries, while the Monte Carlo approach is more suitable for problems with complex boundaries, where the implementation of the iterative algorithm is a challenging task."

These low MTE values are due to the electron refraction on the jump in mass, between a small effective mass in Na$_{2}$KSb and free electron mass in vacuum. It is proved that, at the NEA state, up to half of photoelectrons are emitted in a narrow-angle cone with the fractional MTE of 9\\,meV at room temperature. We also showed that the transition from NEA to positive effective affinity results in the subthermal total MTE of the Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathode, along with quantum efficiency of about 10$^{-2}$. The physical reasons for the manifestation of the refraction effect in multialkali photocathodes are discussed, opening up opportunities for the development of high-brightness and ultracold robust electron sources."

      "summary": "A comparative study of anomalous-Hall current injection and anisotropic current injection (through planar Hall effect) are studied in Hall devices contacted to a lateral load circuit. Hall currents are injected into the load circuit from three different kinds of magnetic Hall bars: Mn5Si3 altermagnet, Co75Gd25 ferrimagnet, and Ni80Fe20 ferromagnet. The current, the voltage and the power are measured as a function of the load resistance and the Hall angle. It is observed that the power dissipated for the three kinds of materials fellow the same law as a function of load resistance and Hall angle, at the leading order in the Hall angle. Since the anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic Hall-bar is due to the intrinsic topological structure (i.e. due to the presence of a Berry phase in the reciprocal space), these observations suggest that the dissipative properties of anomalous Hall effect are dominated by the injection of electric charges accumulated at the edges (including electric screening), instead of the very mechanism responsible for it."

In frustrated models, however, no standard way to produce a comparable gain at small frustration -- let alone efficiently sample the large frustration regime -- has yet been identified. In order to understand why formulating appropriate cluster criteria for frustrated models has thus far been elusive, we here study minimal short-range attractive and long-range repulsive as well as spin-glass models on Bethe lattices. Using a generalization of the CK approach and the cavity-field method, the appropriateness and limitations of the FK--CK type clusters are identified. We find that a standard, constructive cluster scheme is then inoperable, and that the frustration range over which generalized FK--CK clusters are even definable is finite. These results demonstrate the futility of seeking constructive cluster schemes for frustrated systems but leaves open the possibility that alternate approaches could be devised."

The rich interplay between the magnetic ordering and sub-bandgap optical transitions poses a challenge to resolve the mechanisms driving spin-entangled optical transitions, as well as the single-particle bandgap itself. Here we employ a high-fidelity ab initio theory to find a realistic estimation of the bandgap by elucidating the atom- and orbital-resolved contributions to the fundamental sub-bands.

      "summary": "Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moire materials present a unique platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases beyond the paradigm of ideal quantum geometry. While analytical approaches to FCIs and fractional quantum Hall states (FQHS) often rely on idealized Bloch wavefunctions, realistic moire models lack direct tunability of quantum metric and Berry curvature, limiting theoretical and numerical exploration. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework to model interacting Hamiltonians directly through the distribution of single-particle form factors. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE), we show that unsupervised learning can not only distinguish FCI and non-FCI states, but also generate new form factors with distinct topological character, not present in the training set. This latent space enables the generation and interpolation of form factors for topological flatbands with Chern number $|C|=1$, enabling the discovery of unobserved many-body states such as charge density waves. Principal component analysis (PCA) further reveals that the dominant patterns in the form factors-reflecting correlations across the Brillouin zone-can be decomposed into components with approximately quantized Chern numbers, providing new insights into the global and topological structure of quantum geometry. Our results highlight the ability of machine learning to generalize and model topological quantum systems, paving the way for the inverse design of form factors with tailored quantum geometry and many-body phases in flatband materials."

      "summary": "Natural optical activity (NOA), the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, has traditionally been associated with structural chirality. However, this relationship has often been oversimplified, leading to conceptual misunderstandings, particularly when attempts are made to directly correlate structural handedness with optical rotatory power. In reality, the relationship between chirality and NOA is more nuanced: optical activity can arise in both chiral and achiral crystal structures, and the sign of the rotation cannot necessarily be inferred from the handedness of the space group. % In this work, we conduct a first-principles investigation of natural optical activity in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ crystals, focusing on their enantiomorphic structural phase transition from high-symmetry hexagonal ($P6_422$ or $P6_222$) to low-symmetry trigonal ($P3_121$ or $P3_221$) space groups. This transition, driven by the condensation of a zone-center $\\Gamma_3$ phonon mode, reverses the screw axis type given by the space group symbol while leaving the sign of the optical activity unchanged. By following the evolution of the structure and the optical response along the transition pathway, we clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior. We demonstrate that the sense of optical rotation is determined not by the nominal helicity of the screw axis given in the space group symbol, but by the atomic-scale helicity of the most polarizable atoms of the structure."

In this domain, bipolar vertical tunneling junctions composed of van der Waals materials with vastly different electronic band structures enable simultaneous injection of electrons and holes into an optically active material, providing a universal blueprint for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Efficient modulation of the injection efficiency has previously been demonstrated by creating resonant states within the energy barrier formed by the luminescent material. Here, we present an alternative approach towards resonant tunneling conditions by fabricating tunneling junctions composed entirely from gapped materials: Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as electrodes, hBN as a tunneling barrier, and monolayer WSe$_2$ as a luminescent medium. The characterization of such LEDs revealed a nonmonotonous evolution of the electroluminescence intensity with the tunneling bias. The dominant role driving the characteristics of the electron tunneling was associated with the relative alignment of the density of states in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ electrodes. The unique device architecture introduced here presents a universal pathway towards LEDs operating at room temperature with electrically modulated emission intensity."

      "summary": "We explore the existence and dynamical generation of rogue waves (RWs) within a one dimensional quantum droplet bearing environment. RWs are computed by deploying a spacetime fixed point scheme to the relevant extended Gross Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). Parametric regions where the ensuing RWs are different from their counterparts in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are identified. To corroborate the controllable generation, relevant to ultracold atom experiments, of these rogue patterns we exploit two different protocols. The first is based on interfering dam break flows emanating from Riemann initial conditions and the second refers to the gradient catastrophe of a spatially localized waveform. A multitude of possible RWs are found in this system, spanning waveforms reminiscent of the Peregrine soliton, its spatially periodic variants, namely, the Akhmediev breathers, and other higher order RW solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Key elements of the shape of the corresponding eGPE RWs traced back to nonintegrability and the presence of competing interactions are discussed. Our results set the stage for probing a multitude of unexplored rogue like waveforms in such mixtures with competing interactions and should be accessible to current ultracold atom experiments."

      "summary": "In this paper, we assess how the stability of financial networks is affected by interconnectedness considering its tiniest variation: the edge. We compute the impact of edges as the percentage difference in the systemic risk (SR) of the whole network caused by the inclusion of that edge. We apply this framework to a thorough Brazilian dataset to compute the impact of bank-firm edges. After observing that (i) edges are heterogeneous regarding their impact on the SR, and (ii) the fraction of edges whose impact on the SR is non-positive increases with the level of the initial shock, we use machine learning techniques to try to predict two variables: the criticality of the edges (defining as critical an edge whose impact on SR is significantly greater than that of the others) and the sign of the edge impact. The level of accuracy obtained in these prediction exercises was very high. These results have important implications for the development macroprudential policies aimed at financial stability. Our framework allows to identify, based on features related to the origin and destination nodes of the edge (i.e., the lending bank and the borrowing firm), whether an additional loan will have a significant and positive impact on the SR."

      "summary": "Studies of excitonic transport in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers have attracted increasing interest in recent years in order to develop nano-optoelectronic devices made with 2D materials. These studies began with low to moderate optical excitation regimes, and more recently have focused on high injection regimes where nonlinear effects appear. This article is focused on the transport of biexcitons by spatially and temporally resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy at high excitation flux. The study is carried out on a high-quality WSe$_2$ monolayer encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. The results show that a Seebeck current affects transport in connection with the presence of hot biexcitons. In particular, we observe the formation of spatial rings, also called halos, which have been observed in other excitonic gases. These results tend to generalize the importance of high-energy populations in excitonic transport in TMD, even for complex and heavy excitonic particles."

      "summary": "Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in molecular spin triangles."

One limiting factor for the operation of large arrays of qubits is the considerable variation in qubit frequencies or properties resulting from the strongly anisotropic $g$-tensor. We study the $g$-tensors of six and seven qubits in an array with a Y geometry across two devices. We report a mean distribution of the tilts of the $g$-tensor's out-of-plane principal axis of around $1.1 \\deg$, where nearby quantum dots are more likely to have a similar tilt. Independently of this tilt, and unlike simple theoretical predictions, we find a strong in-plane $g$-tensor anisotropy with strong correlations between neighboring quantum dots. Additionally, in one device where the principal axes of all g-tensors are aligned along the [100] crystal direction, we extract the spin-flip tunneling vector from adjacent dot pairs and find a pattern that is consistent with a uniform Dresselhaus-like spin-orbit field. The Y arrangement of the gate layout and quantum dots allows us to rule out local factors like electrostatic confinement shape or local strain as the origin of the preferential direction. Our results reveal long-range correlations in the spin-orbit interaction and $g$-tensors that were not previously predicted or observed, and could prove critical to reliably understand $g$-tensors in germanium quantum dots."

We then answer the question of whether such a model can be trained with minimal excess work, that is, energy dissipation, in a finite amount of time. We find that a Gaussian energy function with constant variance can be trained with minimal excess work by controlling only the learning rate. This proves that it is possible to train a persistent chain EBM in a finite amount of time with minimal dissipation and also provides a lower bound on the energy required for the computation. We refer to such a learning process that minimizes the excess work as minimal-dissipation learning. We then provide a generalization of the optimal learning rate schedule to general potentials and find that it induces a natural gradient flow on the MLE objective, a well-known second-order optimization method."

We use X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to probe the dynamics of a polymer, PM7, in toluene, revealing unexpected oscillations in the autocorrelation function that show vertical flow during measurement. Despite the relatively low X-ray absorption, measured flow velocities scale with X-ray beam power and suggest convective transport. Our analyses reveal both mobile and static scatterers that together produce oscillatory, heterodyne features in the measured correlation functions. Finite element simulations predict flow velocities much larger than observed, suggesting that entanglements of the aggregates slow their motion. These results provide a direct measurement of ultra-slow convection and highlight the need to explicitly account for even modest beam heating in interpreting XPCS results. Moreover, the observation of distinct scatterer populations underscores the structural complexity of conjugated polymer solutions."

The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \\emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions."

First-principles calculations reveal hourglass-shaped bulk band dispersions and a Dirac chain composed of symmetry-protected fourfold-degenerate Dirac points, leading to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level.

      "summary": "Developing new multiferroics at the two-dimensional (2D) limit with energy-efficient magnetoelectric coupling can inform the interplay physics of novel orders and advance on-chip high-performance computing applications. Here we apply stacking order engineering to create a new type of 2D multiferroics, namely sliding multiferroics, based on polar hexagonal stacked (H-stacked) CrI3. This new stacking order removes structural inversion symmetry and gives rise to room temperature sliding ferroelectricity, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, second harmonic generation spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements. Building upon the gate-dependent reflective magnetic circular dichroism, first-principles calculations, and modeling, sliding ferroelectricity is shown to interplay with an emergent interfacial ferromagnetism via interlayer spin-polarized charge transfer. This coupling mechanism results in non-volatile magnetic switching by as low as 0.4V across the H-stacked CrI3. Our demonstration introduces polar stacking order engineering of 2D magnets as a general approach to create non-volatile 2D multiferroics with efficient magnetoelectric coupling, paving the way for low-power electronics and spintronics at the atomically thin limit."

      "summary": "Analysing biological spiking neural network models with synaptic plasticity has proven to be challenging both theoretically and numerically. In a network with N all-to-all connected neurons, the number of synaptic connections is on the order of $N^2$, making these models computationally demanding. Furthermore, the intricate coupling between neuron and synapse dynamics, along with the heterogeneity generated by plasticity, hinder the use of classic theoretical tools such as mean-field or slow-fast analyses. To address these challenges, we introduce a new variable which we term a typical neuron X. Viewed as a post-synaptic neuron, X is composed of the activity state V , the time since its last spike S, and the empirical distribution $\\xi$ of the triplet V , S and W (incoming weight) associated to the pre-synaptic neurons. In particular, we study a stochastic spike-timing- dependent plasticity (STDP) model of connection in a probabilistic Wilson-Cowan spiking neural network model, which features binary neural activity. Taking the large N limit, we obtain from the empirical distribution of the typical neuron a simplified yet accurate representation of the original spiking network. This mean-field limit is a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) of McKean-Vlasov type, where the typical neuron dynamics depends on its own distribution. We term this analysis McKean-Vlasov mean-field (MKV-MF). Our approach not only reduces computational complexity but also provides insights into the dynamics of this spiking neural network with plasticity. The model obtained is mathematically exact and capable of tracking transient changes. This analysis marks the first exploration of MKV-MF dynamics in a network of spiking neurons interacting with STDP."

      "summary": "Carbon capture is vital for decarbonizing heavy industries such as steel and chemicals. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high surface area and structural tunability, are promising materials for CO2 capture. This study focuses on Fe-MOF-74, a magnetic Mott insulator with exposed metal sites that enhance CO2 adsorption. Its strongly correlated electronic structure challenges standard DFT methods, which often yield inconsistent predictions. We initially benchmark adsorption energies using various DFT functionals, revealing substantial variability and underscoring the need for more accurate approaches, such as those provided by quantum computing. However, practical quantum algorithms are far less established for simulations of periodic materials, particularly when the plane-wave basis set, often comprising tens of thousands of basis vectors, is used. To address this, we employ an active space reduction strategy based on Wannier functions and natural orbital selection. Localized orbitals around the adsorption site are identified, and MP2 natural orbitals are used to improve convergence of correlation energies. Adsorption energies are then computed using a quantum number-preserving ansatz within the variational quantum eigensolver framework. In addition to classical simulations, we conduct quantum experiments using the sample-based quantum diagonalization method. Although current hardware limits the size of feasible simulations, our approach offers a more efficient and scalable path forward. These results advance the applicability of quantum algorithms to realistic models of carbon capture and periodic materials more broadly."

      "summary": "In this paper, we study two years of access card validation records from Bogot\\'a's multimodal public transport system, comprising over 2.3 billion trips across bus rapid transit, feeder buses, dual-service buses, and an aerial cable network. By reconstructing user trajectories as motifs, we identify recurrent mobility patterns that extend beyond simple round trips, enabling the construction of an integrated origin-destination (OD) matrix covering 2,828 urban zones. Similarity analysis using the Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the temporal stability of mobility structures across semesters, despite infrastructure changes and fare policy adjustments. From the obtained OD matrices, we derive transition probabilities between zones and uncover a robust power-law relationship with geographical distance, consistent with L\\'evy flight dynamics. We validate our model using Monte Carlo simulations showing that reproduces both local and long-range displacements, with similar scaling exponents across time. These findings demonstrate that Bogot\\'a's public transport mobility can be effectively modeled through L\\'evy processes, providing a novel framework for analyzing complex transportation systems based solely on user access records."

      "summary": "Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum information science and a crucial resource for quantum technologies such as precision sensing, secure communication, and computation. In hybrid cavity magno-optomechanical systems, entanglement among cavity photons, magnons, and phonons enables manipulation of quantum states across different modes via radiation pressure-based light-matter interaction. We propose a hybrid optomechanical cavity-magnonic setup with Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere allowing magnons to couple with photons via magnetic-dipole interaction. The system also uses optomechanical and electrostatic interactions to entangle cavity photons and mechanical resonators. We focus on how the magnon nonlinear Kerr effect and varying coupling strengths influence entanglement dynamics. By analysing nonlinear effects alongside other coupling parameters, we identify optimal conditions for initiating and sustaining robust entanglement between the motional modes (phonons) of two Coulomb-coupled mechanical resonators. Our model predicts that adding Coulomb interaction and magnon coupling enhances the degree and tunability of entanglement, making it more resilient to thermal baths at 3 K. This study addresses how to optimize and sustain phonon-phonon entanglement in complex hybrid quantum systems. These findings offer insights relevant to developing quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and other quantum technologies."

      "summary": "Periodically driven optical materials and metamaterials have recently emerged as a promising platform for realizing photonic time crystals (PTCs) -systems whose optical properties are strongly and periodically modulated on time scales comparable to the optical cycle of light. These time-varying structures are the temporal counterparts of spatial photonic crystals (SPCs), for which a large and periodic dielectric contrast is achieved spatially on wavelength scales. Just as SPCs have revolutionized control over light-matter interactions by engineering the photonic density of states in space, PTCs promise comparable breakthroughs from a fundamentally new perspective: a temporal one. However, harnessing such phenomena at optical frequencies poses severe experimental challenges, as it requires order-unity modulation depths of the optical properties at optical cycle rates, a regime that has remained elusive to date. Here, we report the first optical realization of a photonic time crystal, achieved with a surface plasmon cavity metamaterial operating at Terahertz frequencies. We demonstrate strong (near-unity) and coherent (sub-optical cycle) periodic driving of the plasmonic metamaterial enabled by field-induced dynamical modulation of the carriers' kinetic energy and effective mass - reaching up to 80% of their rest mass, an exceptionally high value that forms the basis for time-crystalline phenomena with plasmons. Our experimentally informed theory reveals rich physics within the experimentally accessible parameter regime of this system, including parametric amplification and entangled plasmon generation, and establishes a robust new platform for time-domain photonics."

      "summary": "The evolution of urban landscapes is rapidly altering the surface of our planet. Yet, our understanding of the urbanisation phenomenon remains far from complete. A fundamental challenge is to describe spatiotemporal changes in the built environment. A dynamic theory of urban evolution should account for both vertical and horizontal city expansion, analogous to the dynamical behaviour of surface growth in physical and biological systems. Here we show that building-height dynamics in cities around the world are well described by a zero-dimensional geometric Brownian motion (GBM), where multiplicative noise drives stochastic fluctuations around a deterministic drift associated with economic growth. To account for intra-city correlations, we extend the GBM with spatial coupling, revealing how local interactions effectively mitigate noise-driven fluctuations and shape urban morphology. The continuum limit of this spatial model can be recasted into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and we find that empirical estimates of the roughness exponent are in the range of the KPZ prediction for most cities. Together, these results show that multiplicative noise, moderated by local interactions, governs the evolution of urban roughness, anchoring spatiotemporal city dynamics in a well-established statistical physics framework."

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mathematical modeling of this complex phenomenon.

However, achieving this under ambient temperature conditions remains challenging due to rapid dephasing in optically excited systems. Optical metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum have recently emerged as a powerful platform for reaching the strong light-matter coupling regime in flat, subwavelength thickness devices. Here, we investigate ultrafast exciton-polariton dynamics in self-hybridized WS$_2$ thin-film metasurfaces. Using hyperspectral momentum-resolved imaging, we reconstruct the highly anisotropic exciton-polariton dispersion, with a transition from positive to negative effective mass along orthogonal symmetry axes. Femtosecond pump-probe and multidimensional spectroscopy reveal detuning-dependent polariton dynamics with a coherence time up to ~110 fs, and allow direct observation of the coherent dynamics through ultrafast Rabi oscillations with ~45 fs period. We describe this behaviour with a three-eigenstate model that couples the photonic resonance with both bright and dark excitons, extending the conventional two-state picture of strong coupling. Our results establish van der Waals metasurfaces as a promising platform for next-generation polaritonic devices, enabling coherent quantum transfer of matter excitations at room temperature."

For a free scalar field, one naturally requires that the scalar fields are continuous at the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new junction condition that instead requires the normal derivative of the scalar field to be continuous at the node. We demonstrate that this new junction condition is consistent with the variational principle and energy conservation. Furthermore, we provide an exact realization of it in a real physical system. As an application, we analyze the Casimir effect using both the traditional and the new junction conditions in networks formed by regular polyhedra. Our results indicate that the new junction condition generally results in a smaller Casimir effect."

Similar in principle, these studies can be executed in tracking how a given function of observable properties evolve over time akin to a system's particle motion, so-called {\\it functional-diffusion}. This is not the same as systems' own trajectories but can be considered as a meta-trajectory. Following this idea, we measure how an approach to ergodicity evolves over time for the observed magnetization of a full Ising model with an external field. We compute the functional's diffusive behavior depending on a range of temperatures via Metropolis and Glauber single-spin-flip dynamics. System's ensemble-averaged dynamics are computed using expressions from the exact solution. Power-laws on the approach to ergodicity provide the classification of anomalies in the {\\it functional-diffusion}, demonstrating non-linear super-diffusive behavior over different temperature ranges."

Here we use molecular dynamic simulations to study the domain wall stability in the prototypical ferroelectric BaTiO3 combining core-shell pair potentials and a coarse-grained effective Hamiltonian. We transfer the discussion of the field-driven nucleation and motion of domain walls to thermally induced modifications of the wall without an external driving force. Our simulations show that domain wall dynamics and stability depend crucially on microscopic thermal fluctuations. Enhanced fluctuations at domain walls may result in the formation of critical nuclei for the permanent shift of the domain wall. If two domain walls are close - put in other words, when domains are small - thermal fluctuations can be sufficient to bring domain walls into contact and lead to the annihilation of small domains. This is even true well below the Curie temperature and when domain walls are initially as far apart as 6 unit cells. Such small domains are, thus, not stable and limit the maximum achievable domain wall density in nanoelectronic devices."

When applied to thermal relaxation, it reveals a universal trade-off relation between the dissipation rate and the intrinsic relaxation timescale. From this relation, a thermodynamic upper bound on the relaxation time between two given states emerges, acting as an inverse speed limit over the entire time region. We also obtain a quantum version of this upper bound, which is always tighter than its classical counterpart, incorporating an additional term due to decoherence. Remarkably, we further demonstrate that the trade-off relation remains valid for any generally non-Markovian coarse-grained relaxation dynamics, highlighting its significant applications in thermodynamic inference. This trade-off relation is a new tool in inferring EPRs in molecular dynamics simulations and practical experiments."

Unfortunately, interaction-driven phenomena such as the transition into the strongly correlated Mott insulator phase are difficult to treat with established theoretical techniques. However, the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model displays similar Mott physics. Here we show how the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model can be deformed continuously into the Hubbard model. The trick is to systematically re-introduce all the momentum mixing the original Hatsugai-Kohmoto model omits. This can be accomplished by grouping $n$-momenta into a cell and hybridizing them resulting in the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto (MMHK) model. We recover the Bethe ansatz ground state energy of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to within 1$\\%$ from only ten mixed momenta. Overall the convergence scales as $1/n^2$ as opposed to the inverse linear behaviour of standard finite-cluster techniques. Our results for a square lattice reproduce all known features from state-of-the-art simulations also with only a few mixed momenta. Consequently, we believe the MMHK model offers an alternative tool for strongly correlated quantum matter."

Even for cases where single droplets constantly grow, coupling many droplets via the conserved density in the far field leads to a self-organized reversal of ripening and, thus, a monodisperse emulsion. For late times, we find a scaling ansatz leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions, different from the LSW theory. This scaling behavior arises from a stable fixed point in the single droplet dynamics and may capture the late-time behavior of many active matter systems exhibiting reversed ripening."

If the system is finite and remains bound, the long time average of the excess energy tends to $Mv^2$, with M the system's total mass, or a related expression if there is particle emission. $Mv^2$ is twice what expected from an infinitely smooth onset of motion, and any monotonic onset is expected to increase the average energy to a value within both limits. In a macroscopic system, a particle flow emerges countering the potential's motion when electrons stay partially behind. For charged particles the described kinetic kick is equivalent to the kick given by the infinitely short electric-field pulse $E = \\frac{m}{q} v \\delta (t)$ to the system at rest, useful as a formal limit in ultrafast phenomena. A linear-response analysis of low-v countercurrents in kicked metals shows that the coefficient of the linear term in v is the Drude weight. Non-linear in v countercurrents are expected for insulators through the electron-hole excitations induced by the kick, going as $v^3$ at low v for centrosymmetric ones. First-principles calculations for simple solids are used to ratify those predictions, although the findings apply more generally to systems such as Mott insulators or cold lattices of bosons or fermions."

      "summary": "We present a comprehensive Floquet-Nambu theory to describe the time-dependent quantum transport in mesoscopic circuits involving superconductors. The central object of our framework is the first-order correlation function, which accounts for the excitations that are generated by a time-dependent voltage and their coherent scattering off the interface with a superconductor. We analyze the time-dependent current generated by periodic voltage pulses and how it depends on the excitation energies of the voltage drive compared to the gap of the superconductor. Our general formalism allows us to identify the conditions for the excitations that are scattered off the superconductor to become coherent electron-hole superpositions. To this end, we consider the purity of the outgoing states, which characterizes their ability to carry quantum information. To illustrate our formalism, we apply it to a system composed of chiral quantum Hall edge states connected to a superconductor, and we calculate the current in the outgoing lead and the purity of the outgoing states for Lorentzian and harmonic voltage drives. Our framework paves the way for systematic investigations of time-dependent scattering problems involving superconductivity, and it may help interpret future experiments in electron quantum optics with superconductors."

      "summary": "For over a hundred years, electron transport in conductive materials has been primarily described by the Drude model, which assumes that current flow is impeded primarily by momentum-relaxing collisions between electrons and extrinsic objects such as impurities or phonons. In the past decade, however, experiments have increasingly realized ultra-high quality electronic materials that demonstrate a qualitatively distinct method of charge transport called hydrodynamic flow. Hydrodynamic flow occurs when electrons collide much more frequently with each other than with anything else, and in this limit the electric current has long-wavelength collective behavior analogous to that of a classical fluid. While electron hydrodynamics has long been postulated theoretically for solid-state systems, the plethora of recent experimental realizations has reinvigorated the field. Here, we review recent theoretical and experimental progress in understanding hydrodynamic electrons using the (hydrodynamic) Fermi liquid as our prototypical example."

The maximum entropy method is a reconstruction technique that utilizes prior information, referred to as the default model, to recover original signals from observed data, and it is widely used in underdetermined systems. The broad applications have been reported in fields ranging from the analysis of observational data in seismology and astronomy, to large-scale computations in quantum chemistry, and even in social sciences such as linguistics. However, a known drawback of MEM is that its results depend on the assumed default model. In this study, we employ the replica method to elucidate how discrepancies in the default model affect the reconstruction of signals with specific distributions. We report that in certain cases, even small discrepancies can induce phase transitions, leading to reconstruction failure. Additionally, by comparing MEM with reconstruction based on L1-norm optimization, a method proposed in recent years, we demonstrate that MEM exhibits lower reconstruction accuracy under certain conditions."

Here, we demonstrate the power of this method by predicting entropies, enthalpies, and melting points for 25 binary and ternary chlorite- and fluoride-based molten salts using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations.

      "summary": "Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and prominent mode confinement. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm the presence of resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\\text{Bi}_2\\text{Sr}_2\\text{CaCu}_2\\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. Our work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground state properties of complex quantum materials."

Moment tensor potentials were used for calculating energies and forces of interatomic interactions. The methods based on the solution of Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons and the GreenKubo (GK) formula were utilized to calculate LTC. The 20-40 % difference in LTC values obtained with GK and BTE-based methods showed the importance of high-order anharmonic contributions to LTC. Significant reduction (by 4.5 - 9 times) of the in-plane LTC with the twist angle increase caused by the growth of structural disorder was observed in the Moir\\'e diamanes. This growth of disorder also leads to higher band gap renormalization (induced by classical nuclei motion) in the structures with higher twist angles. Significant band gap renormalization values obtained considering the quantum nuclear effects are caused by the high phonon frequencies related to the bonds with hydrogen atoms on the Moir\\'e diamanes surfaces. Understanding of the twist angle effect on LTC and electron-phonon coupling in the Moir\\'e diamanes provides a fundamental basis for manipulating their thermal and electronic properties, making these materials promising for thermoelectrics, microelectronics and optoelectronics."

      "summary": "An impurity immersed in a Bose condensate can form a quasiparticle known as a Bose polaron. When the impurity-boson interaction is short-ranged, the quasiparticle properties can be characterized in terms of the impurity-boson scattering length $a_{\\mathrm{IB}}$ and the condensate coherence length $\\xi$, a universal description that remains valid irrespective of the bath density $n_0$. Long-ranged interactions -such as provided by Rydberg or ionic impurities- introduce an effective interaction range $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ as the third length scale. These competing length scales raise the question of whether a universal description remains valid across different bath densities. In this study, we discuss the quasiparticle nature of long-range impurities and its dependence on the length scales $n_0^{-1/3}$, $r_\\mathrm{eff}$, and $\\xi$. We employ two complementary theories -the coherent state Ansatz and the perturbative Gross-Pitaevskii theory- which incorporate beyond-Fr\\\"ohlich interactions. We derive an analytical expression for the beyond-Fr\\\"ohlich effective mass for a contact interaction and numerically compute the effective mass for long-range impurities. We argue that the coupling parameter $|a_{\\mathrm{IB}}|n_0^{1/3}$ remains the principal parameter governing the properties of the polaron. For weak ($|a_\\mathrm{IB}|n_0^{1/3}\\ll 1$) and intermediate ($|a_\\mathrm{IB}|n_0^{1/3}\\simeq 1$) values of the coupling parameter, long-range impurities in a Bose condensate are well-described as quasiparticles with a finite quasiparticle weight and a well-defined effective mass. However, the quasiparticle weight becomes significantly suppressed as the effective impurity volume is occupied by an increasing number of bath particles ($r_{\\mathrm{eff}}n_0^{1/3} \\gg 1$)."

Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM."

Instead of considering backflow terms from all sites, competitive results are achieved by considering nearest-neighbor or next-nearest-neighbor backflow terms. Meanwhile the variational wave-function is not enforced on geometric symmetries. When $t'$=0, by considering nearest-neighbor backflow terms, linear stripe order is sucessfully obtained for the case of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\\times 16$ lattice under periodoc boundary condition. For a similar case under open boundary condition, obtained energy is only $4.5\\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. Comparing to state-of-the-art neural network results, energies are competitive and relative errors are below $5\\times 10^{-3}$. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations. When $t'$=-0.2, by considering next-nearest-neighbor backflow terms, obtained energies are competitive or even lower than state-of-the-art neural network results. For example, obtained energy for $n$=0.875, $U$=8 on the $12\\times 12$ lattice under PBC is $8.1\\times 10^{-4}$ lower comparing to that from the neural network state. Therefore, the Tensor-Backflow method has strong representation abilities for the Fermi-Hubbard model."

Using the property of the bound spectrum (upper bound) of the Morse potential, limited by the bond dissociation energy, we analytically derive the generalized partition function. We present results for both the high- and low-temperature limits. We propose the effective number of accessible states as a measure of nonextensivity. The calculation shows that the nonextensive framework further restricts the number of accessible states. We also derive the generalized internal energy and entropy and examine their dependence on temperature and the nonextensivity parameter \\( q \\). Numerical results confirm the strong effect of nonextensive behavior in the low-temperature regime (precisely low to moderate temperature), where the ratio of generalized internal energy and internal energy calculated from the Boltzmann Gibbs (BG) formula develops a nontrivial dip structure for \\( q < 1 \\). Moreover, the generalized specific heat shows the Schottky-type anomaly. We extend our study by deriving the specific heat of solids with BG and Tsallis statistics using the anharmonic energy levels of the Morse oscillator. This study suggests that the Morse oscillator is a solvable and physically meaningful testing ground for exploring the thermodynamics of quantum systems driven by nonextensive statistics, with implications for the vibrational properties of the non-equilibrium molecular thermodynamics (especially diatomic molecules)."

Theoretical descriptions of this system have predominantly relied on contact pseudopotentials to model the impurity-bath interaction, leading to unphysical results in the strongly coupled limit. In this work, we analytically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, using a square well potential instead of a zero-range potential, for the ground-state wave function of a static impurity. We compute perturbative corrections arising from infinitesimally slow impurity motion. The polaron energy and effective mass remain finite in the strongly coupled regime, in contrast to the divergent behavior obtained using a contact potential. In this limit, we characterize the polaron properties in terms of the dimensionless ratio $\\bar{w}\\equiv w/\\xi$ between the interaction range $w$ of the impurity-bath potential and the coherence length $\\xi$ of the Bose gas. The effective mass exhibits a $1/\\bar{w}$ scaling. The energy of the attractive polaron scales as $-1/\\bar{w}^3$, whereas the repulsive polaron features subleading corrections to the dark soliton energy at the order $\\bar{w}^3$."

When only a magnetic field is present, ring-exchange processes arise from multi-particle tunneling through {\\it complex} trajectories which constitute {\\it complex instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in $B$, each exchange constant $J_a$ acquires an Aharonov-Bohm phase along the zero-field tunneling trajectory. When a Berry curvature is present, the multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a complexified phase space $({\\bf r}, {\\bf k})$. To leading order in $\\Omega$, $J_a$ acquires a Berry phase along a {\\it purely imaginary} momentum-space trajectory. When $B$ and $\\Omega$ are both present, in addition to having both Aharonov-Bohm and Berry phases, the exchange magnitude $|J_a|$ is also modified due to an effective-mass renormalization. These effects could be relevant for the WC and proximate phases recently observed in rhombohedral multilayer graphene."

The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \\emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\\beta \\sim {\\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The range of the relaxation time is observed to decrease as the temperature increases."

Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities.

      "summary": "A shift of paradigm to obtain (sub-)Kelvin environment is currently on-going with the democratization of cryogen-free cryocoolers, boosted by their easy-to-use and continuous operation without the need of liquid helium whose cost and scarcity globally increase. Thanks to their large sample space and cooling power, they can host a superconducting magnet and are an adapted platform for quantum technologies, material science, low temperature detectors and even medical fields. The drawback is that this type of system is inherently based on gas compression that induces a certain level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, which can potentially prevent the determination of low amplitude signals or spoil their stability. In this paper we demonstrate that pulse-tube based cryocoolers can be used for electrical precision measurements, using a commercial cryomagnetic system combined with our home-made a coaxial cryoprobe. In particular, parts-per-billion level of measurement uncertainties in resistance determination, based on quantum Hall resistance standards, is achievable at the level of state-of-the-art measurements involving conventional cryostats based on liquid helium. We performed an extensive characterization of the cryomagnetic system to determine the level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, and revealed that although the magnetic field has a drastic effect on the noise level, only marginal interplays on the measurement are observed as long as the working frequencies of the instrumentation are not in the vicinity of the ones of the perturbations. The set of characterization measurements presented here are easily implementable in laboratories, which can help to determine the vibrations and electromagnetic pollution generated by any cryocooler."

      "summary": "The diffusion of tracer particles immersed in a granular gas under uniform shear flow (USF) is analyzed within the framework of the inelastic Boltzmann equation. Two different but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results. First, we maintain the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator but consider inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). Using IMM allows us to compute the collisional moments of the Boltzmann operator without knowing the velocity distribution functions of the granular binary mixture explicitly. Second, we consider a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres (IHS). This kinetic model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of IHS. We solve the Boltzmann--Lorentz kinetic equation for tracer particles using a generalized Chapman--Enskog--like expansion around the shear flow distribution. This reference distribution retains all hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. The mass flux is obtained to first order in the deviations of the concentration, pressure, and temperature from their values in the reference state. Due to the velocity space anisotropy induced by the shear flow, the mass flux is expressed in terms of tensorial quantities rather than the conventional scalar diffusion coefficients. The exact results derived here are compared with those previously obtained for IHS by using different approximations [JSTAT P02012 (2007)]. The comparison generally shows reasonable quantitative agreement, especially for IMM results. Finally, we study segregation by thermal diffusion as an application of the theory. The phase diagrams illustrating segregation are shown and compared with IHS results, demonstrating qualitative agreement."

It orders antiferromagnetically at TN1 = 7.1 K and undergoes further magnetic transition at TN2 = 5.7 K. The complex magnetic structures are attributed to competing order parameters of magnetic and quadrupolar origin with significant magnetoelastic coupling. Here, we investigate the response of the lattice of HoB4 across the antiferromagnetic phase transitions by using low-temperature powder x-ray diffraction and ultrasound-velocity measurements, supported by crystal electric field (CEF) calculations. Below TN2, the crystal structure of HoB4 changes to monoclinic (space group P21/b) as a macroscopic manifestation of the quadrupolar ordering. Between 300 and 3.5 K, the total distortion amplitude is 0.46~\\AA\\ and the relative volume change is $3.5 \\times 10^{-3}$. This structural phase transition is compatible with the huge softening of the modulus $C_{44}$ observed around TN2 due to ferroquadrupolar order. A lattice instability developing immediately below TN1 is seen consistently in x-ray and ultrasound data. CEF analysis suggests a quasi-degenerated ground state for the Ho$^{3+}$ ions in this system."

      "summary": "We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60% higher than the initial value, then decays into a metastable state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of multi-electron correlations. In stark contrast to conventional asymmetric systems where SHG is typically suppressed upon photoexcitation, our experimental findings shed a new light on ultrafast optical control nonlinear properties in quantum materials."

CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by including the correlation energy $E_c$ from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+$E_c$ produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen lattice systems."

      "summary": "The V2O3 phase diagram contains two insulating phases and one metallic phase with different lattice structures. The stability of these phases is very sensitive to pressure, offering a mechanism to tune phase transitions by inducing strain in thin films. The most studied source of strain is lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. In this work, however, we find that the film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch can be made to play a dominant role by modifying the substrate morphology. When grown on sapphire, the lattice mismatch induces compressive strain in the V2O3 films, whereas thermal expansion mismatch induces tensile strain. We find that minute changes in substrate morphology may relax the compressive strain component, allowing the thermally-induced tensile component to overcome it. Thus, by simple annealing of the substrates to create either a flat or stepped morphology, strongly compressive or tensile strains may be induced in the films. This results in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases at all temperatures, exhibiting many orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. To elucidate the strain relaxation mechanism, we use high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) to image the atomic steps in the substrate and the adjacent crystallographic defects in the V2O3. These findings offer a hitherto underexplored mechanism to tune strain in thin films, deepen our understanding of the effects of structural degrees of freedom on phase stability of a canonical Mott insulator and may allow for applications requiring insulator-metal switching above room temperature."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems."

Here, we show that similar 2D entanglement properties can be realized by twisting a single 1D chain embedded on a 2D lattice. The interaction to generate such 2D entanglement is much simpler than the previous 2D construction by coupling orthogonal arrays of 1D highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with enhanced entanglement entropy at the critical point compared to the previous bona fide 2D models, but the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase decays faster. The tensor network representation of the new ground state is composed of tensors with lower rank, showing a similar global geometry as those of the old ones."

Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs states evade sudden death of entanglement and have persistent fermionic negativity at high temperatures, proving along the way some existing conjectures about fermionic entanglement. These findings demonstrate that global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and quantum information in thermal equilibrium."

In this paper, we consider theories with non-invertible symmetries that have an explicit Lagrangian description, and use it to study their higher structure. Starting with the 2d free compact boson theory and its non-invertible duality defects, we will find Lagrangian descriptions of networks of defects and use them to recover all the $F$-symbols of the familiar Tambara-Yamagami fusion category $\\operatorname{TY}(\\mathbb{Z}_N,+1)$. We will then use the same approach in 4d Maxwell theory to compute $F$-symbols associated with its non-invertible duality and triality defects, which are 2d topological field theories. In addition, we will also compute some of the $F$-symbols using a different (group theoretical) approach that is not based on the Lagrangian description, and find that they take the expected form."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Significant advances in silicon spin qubits highlight the potential of silicon quantum dots for scalable quantum computing, given their compatibility with industrial fabrication and long coherence times. In particular, phosphorus (P)-doped spin qubits possess excellent coherence and have demonstrated high-fidelity two-qubit gates exceeding 99.9%. However, scaling P-donor systems is challenging due to crosstalk caused by the uniformity of individual P donors and the low tolerance for imprecise atomic placement. Stochastic placement can lead to multiple donors located within a small region (diameter <3 nm), forming a so-called donor cluster. Notably, in cluster-based systems, high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum gates and all-to-all connectivity have recently been demonstrated experimentally on nuclear spin qubits. In this work, we propose a scalable cluster-array architecture for nuclear spin qubits and a corresponding control protocol. We analyze crosstalk-induced errors, a major error source, during primitive operations under various parameters, showing that they can be suppressed through device design and control optimization. We evaluate the fidelities of intra- and inter-cluster multi-qubit gates between nuclear spins, confirming the feasibility of our architecture and establishing design requirements and parameter targets. The local all-to-all connectivity within clusters provides unique flexibility for quantum error correction. Our scalable scheme provides a path toward large-scale spin-based quantum processors."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum \"photograph\" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition."

Moreover, $Q_{\\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits."
