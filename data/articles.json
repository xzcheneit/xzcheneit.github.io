      "summary": "The authors demonstrate here that strain-gradient engineering in bent MoSi 2 N 4 nanoribbons induces not only self-doping and a nonzero Berry curvature dipole, but also achieves an outstanding flexoelectric power conversion efficiency of 9.05%, the highest among 2D flexophotovoltaic systems. Under circularly polarized light, the bent MoSi 2 N 4 photodetector generates a self-powered spin photocurrent. These results advance the fundamental understanding of mechanical-electronic coupling in 2D materials and highlight the potential of MoSi 2 N 4 for high-efficiency solar cells, optoelectronics, and spintronic applications.
