The in vitro biomineralization and biodegradation of the samples were also investigated by electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. These assessments revealed that there is an optimum level of fluoride doping to meet the highest bioactivity. Remarkably, the same level of incorporation presented the foremost biocompatibility with respect to osteoblast-like MG-63 human cells, as realized by the MTT assay and cell attachment studies."

This validates the proposed superconducting formula and unifies copper-based and nickel-based superconductors at the angstrom-scale octahedral quantum well.

      "summary": "Recent experiments on few-layer graphene structures have reported indirect signatures of anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs), but the need for a top gate to stabilize the phase precludes direct imaging of the emergent electronic lattice. This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs."

A basic requirement is that such models are able to capture {\\it evolving} plastic anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry. To this end, two-surface and three-surface plasticity models are considered. The two-surface constitutive formulation separately accounts for slip and twinning, while the three-surface model further apportions the contributions of basal and nonbasal slip. Model identification is based on stress-strain responses for loading along six orientations under both tension and compression. The evolution of overall plastic anisotropy, as well as microscale relative activities of slip and twin systems, is analyzed in detail. The prospects of using coarse-grained plasticity models in guiding the development of physically sound damage models for magnesium alloys are discussed."

The distinctive feature of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia are the critical sizes of ferroelectricity appearance, whereas the critical sizes of ferroelectricity disappearance exist in other ferroelectrics. Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, nonpolar and antipolar order parameters, we calculated analytically the strain-dependent critical sizes of the ferroelectricity appearance and disappearance, analyzed how the size effect and mismatch strains influence the phase diagrams and polarization switching barrier in epitaxial HfO2 thin films and nano-islands with the out-of-plane spontaneous polarization. We have shown that the critical thickness/height of out-of-plane spontaneous polarization disappearance is determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The critical thickness/height of the ferroelectricity appearance is determined by the size dependence of the effective mismatch strain considering possible appearance of misfit dislocations and lateral relaxion of strains. Derived analytical expressions can be generalized for HfxZr1-xO2 solid solutions, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations."

In synchronization with the emergence of the ferromagnetic phase resulting in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), a noticeable enhancement in the SHE was observed below $T_{\\rm C}$. On the other hand, the SHE shows a different temperature dependence from the AHE: the effective spin Hall conductivity is clearly enhanced with decreasing temperature unlike the anomalous Hall conductivity, reflecting the variation of band-structure accompanied by the complicated magnetic ordering of the FGT. The results provide a deep understanding of the SHE in magnetic materials to open a new route for novel functionalities in vdW materials-based spintronic devices."

      "summary": "We investigate a minimal chase-and-escape model on a two-dimensional square lattice with randomly distributed static obstacles, focusing on how geometric disorder controls collective pursuit dynamics. Chasers and escapers move according to short-range sensing rules, while the density of obstacles tunes the connectivity of the accessible space. Using a combination of geometric analysis, dynamical observables, survival statistics, and transport characterization, we establish a direct link between lattice connectivity and pursuit efficiency. A Breadth-First Search analysis reveals that obstacle-induced fragmentation leads to a progressive loss of accessibility before the percolation threshold, defining the effective initial conditions for the dynamics. The trapping time and capture cost exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on obstacle density, reflecting a competition between path elongation in connected environments and geometric confinement near the percolation threshold. Survival analysis shows that the decay of the escaper population follows a Weibull form, with characteristic time and shape parameters displaying clear crossovers as a function of obstacle density, signaling the coexistence of cooperative capture and confinement-dominated trapping. Transport properties, quantified through the mean-squared displacement exponent, further support this picture, revealing sub-diffusive dynamics and a convergence toward a geometry-controlled regime near percolation. Overall, our results demonstrate that chase--and--escape dynamics in disordered environments are governed by a geometry-driven crossover, where percolation and connectivity act as unifying control parameters for spatial, temporal, and collective behavior."

In addition, we investigate the effects of second-nearest neighbor hopping $t_1$ on a pure CDW state. The analysis of the results show that, for small values of $t_1$, both CDW and superconducting gaps compete for the same region on the Fermi surface. The increase of $t_1$ decreases the competition and may lead the system to a coexistence regime. Effects of temperature in the coexistence regime, are also investigated."

      "summary": "Phase transitions are omnipresent in modern condensed matter physics and its applications. In solids, phase transformations typically occur by nucleation and growth under non-equilibrium conditions. Under constant external conditions, $\\textit{e.g.}$, constant heating temperature and pressure, the nucleation and growth dynamics are often thought of as spatially and temporally independent. Here, $\\textit{in-situ}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) reveals nanoscale spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in the perovskite to brownmillerite topotactic phase transformation in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ (LSCO) thin films under constant reducing conditions over a time-span of multiple hours. Specifically, a timescale associated with domain growth remains stable, with a corresponding domain wall speed of $v_d = 6 \\pm 0.5 \\times10^{-4}$ nm/s ($2 \\pm 0.2$ nm/h), while a slower timescale, associated with temperature driven de-pinning of domains, leads to accelerating dynamics with timescales following an aging power law with exponent $-2.2 \\pm 0.5$. The experiment demonstrates that Bragg XPCS is a powerful tool to study nanoscale dynamics in phase transformations. The results are relevant for phase engineering of phase-change devices, as they show that nanoscale dynamics, linked to domain and domain-wall motion, can continuously evolve and speed up with time, even hours after the initiation of the phase transformation, with potential repercussions on electrical performance."

      "summary": "Amorphous oxyhalides have attracted significant attention due to their relatively high ionic conductivity ($>$1 mS cm$^{-1}$), excellent chemical stability, mechanical softness, and facile synthesis routes via standard solid-state reactions. These materials exhibit an ionic conductivity that is almost independent of the underlying chemistry, in stark contrast to what occurs in crystalline conductors. In this work, we employ an accurately fine-tuned machine learning interatomic potential to construct large-scale molecular dynamics trajectories encompassing hundreds of nanoseconds to obtain statistically converged transport properties. We find that the amorphous state consists of chain fragments of metal-anion tetrahedra of various lenght. By analyzing the residence time of alkali cations migrating around tetrahedrally-coordinated trivalent metal ions, we find that oxygen anions on the metal-anion tetrahedra limit alkali diffusion. By computing the full Einstein expression of the ionic conductivity, we demonstrate that the alkali transference number of these materials is strongly influenced by distinct-particles correlations, while at the same time they are characterized by an alkali Haven ratio close to one, implying that ionic transport is largely dictated by uncorrelated self-diffusion. Finally, by extending this analysis to chemical compositions $AMX_{2.5}\\textsf{O}_{0.75}$, spanning different alkaline ($A$ = Li, Na, K), metallic ($M$ = Al, Ga, In), and halogen ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) species, we clarify why the diffusion properties of these materials remain largely insensitive to variations in atomic chemistry."

Metastable single-phase Ag-Cu thin films are deposited on Si substrates pre-patterned by FIB milling. During post-deposition annealing, localized film-substrate reaction around the milled patterns produces a distinct microstructure termed as the halo. It consists of copper silicide and almost pure Ag, while the far-field film forms a random mixture of Cu and Ag-rich domains through phase separation. We show that the extent of the halo can be controlled by varying the temperature and duration of annealing. However, its length scale does not follow the square-root time dependence typical of diffusional growth. We build a semi-analytical kinetic model of halo growth that incorporates species balance, diffusional transport and a modified Stefan condition. Predictions of the model agree well with the experimental findings and the species diffusivity through the film is obtained through an inverse optimization procedure."

The band structures are calculated for 15 types of their different AFM structures. It is verified for these structures that there is a very simple rule to identify which wave number k exhibits spin splitting or degeneracy in the band structure. This rule uses the symmetry operations that map the up-spin atoms onto the down-spin atoms. The resulting spin splitting is very small for the most stable spin configuration of the most stable experimental structure. We discuss a plausible benefit of this characteristic, i.e., the direction-independence of the spin current, in electrode applications."

      "summary": "We present a theoretical study of the low-energy physics of a quarter-hole-filled two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model motivated by transition-metal bilayer systems with strong orbital-selective interlayer hybridization. By explicitly treating the strong interlayer bonding of dz2 orbitals within a molecular orbital basis and projecting out high-energy electronic states, we derive a low-energy effective Kugel-Khomskii Hamiltonian describing the interplay between electron spin and emergent layer pseudospin degrees of freedom. We map out a rich ground state phase diagram featuring diverse spin and charge ordered states. These include conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases with layer staggered charge densities, a layer-coherent phase characterized by spontaneous interlayer quantum coherence, and a novel maximally spin-layer-entangled phase with a hidden composite spin-layer order. We show that this exotic hidden ordered phase arises from the spontaneous breaking of an emergent O(4) symmetry down to a O(3), manifesting a unique excitation spectrum with three entangled gapless Goldstone modes. Our results uncover a geometrically driven mechanism for realizing composite entanglement in strongly correlated bilayer systems and provide a concrete theoretical framework relevant to bilayer nickelate superconductors and other multi-component correlated materials."

      "summary": "In many-body quantum systems, interactions drive the emergence of correlations that are at the heart of the most intriguing states of matter. A remarkable example is the case of weakly interacting bosonic systems, whose ground state is a squeezed vacuum state, and whose elementary excitations have a collective nature. In this work, we report on the direct observation of the peculiar microscopic quantum structure of these elementary excitations. We perform time- and frequency-resolved two-photon correlation measurements on the fluctuations of weakly interacting polaritons in a resonantly-driven microcavity, and observe that upon decreasing the average number of fluctuation quanta below unity, large pair correlations build up together with strong time-ordering of the emitted photons. This behavior is a direct signature of the particle-hole quantum superposition which is at the heart of Bogoliubov excitations."

Nanomaterials can play a pivotal role in catalysing charge storage and/or exchange, still the underlying mechanism often remains poorly investigated, as for ZnO/ZnS nanostructures onto Ni foam. In this work, we investigate hydrothermally grown ZnO/ZnS nanostructures decorating Ni foam for energy storage application. Morphology, structure and composition are evaluated via electron microscopy-based methodologies. The electrochemical energy storage performance is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with the aim to highlight the energy storage mechanism. When nickel foam (NF) is used as substrate, the system shows a predominant pseudocapacitive behaviour. By contrast, a modest and capacitive performance is measured on graphene paper (GP). Mott-Schottky (M-S) and open circuit potential (OCP) measurements suggests a key role of hole reservoir in ZnS decoration which boosts NF performances."

      "summary": "Heterogeneous nucleation is the main path to ice formation on Earth. The ice nucleating ability of a certain substrate is mainly determined by both molecular interactions and the structural mismatch between the ice and the substrate lattices. We focus on the latter factor using molecular simulations of the mW model. Quantifying the effect of structural mismatch alone is challenging due to its coupling with molecular interactions. To disentangle both factors, we use a substrate composed of water molecules in such a way that any variation on the nucleation temperature can be exclusively ascribed to the structural mismatch. We find that a one per cent increase of structural mismatch leads to a decrease of approximately 4 K in the nucleation temperature. We also analyse the effect of the orientation of the substrate with respect to the liquid. The three main ice orientations (basal, primary prism and secondary prism) have a similar ice nucleating ability. We finally asses the effect of lattice flexibility by comparing substrates where molecules are immobile with others where a certain freedom to fluctuate around the lattice positions is allowed. Interestingly, we find that the latter type of substrate is more efficient in nucleating ice because it can adapt its structure to that of ice."

Using numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate AM-like phases within the Ising-Kondo lattice model which is commonly employed to describe heavy-fermion materials. By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties."

In confined, curved systems -- such as those encountered in atomisation, abrasion, and micrometeorite formation -- positive curvature and finite boundaries significantly modify classical solidification dynamics. In this study, we systematically investigate the solidification of metallic spheres, focusing on how curvature and confinement influence nucleation pathways, growth kinetics, and interfacial stability. Two competing growth modes -- radial outward and circumferential -- are analysed using Stefan-type models under a quasi-steady approximation. A generalisation of Mullins--Sekerka stability theory is developed to account for finite spherical domains, revealing that particle size and curvature introduce new destabilising parameters that govern microstructural length scales. Experimental observations of dendritic and cellular morphologies are interpreted through this framework, demonstrating that the interaction between growth fronts, undercooling, and curvature collectively determines the final particle structure. These findings underscore the need to re-evaluate classical solidification theories in the context of curved geometries, with implications for both engineered and naturally occurring metal powders."

      "summary": "The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric (TE) materials for advancing green energy harvesting from waste heat is an urgent need in the context of looming energy crisis and climate change. The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has accelerated the design of thermoelectric (TE) materials, yet a persistent \"gap\" remains between high-accuracy computational predictions and their successful experimental validation. While ML models frequently report impressive test scores (R^2 values of 0.90-0.98) for complex TE properties (zT, power factor, and electrical/thermal conductivity), only a handful of these predictions have culminated in the experimental discovery of new high-zT materials. In this review, we identify and discuss that the primary obstacles are poor model generalizability-stemming from the \"small-data\" problem, sampling biases in cross-validation, and inadequate structural representation-alongside the critical challenge of thermodynamic phase stability. Moreover, we argue that standard randomized validation often overestimates model performance by ignoring \"hidden hierarchies\" and clustering within chemical families. Finally, to bridge this gap between ML-predictions and experimental realization, we advocate for advanced validation strategies like PCA-based sampling and a synergetic active learning loop that integrates ML \"fast filters\" for stability (e.g., GNoME) with high-throughput combinatorial thin-film synthesis to rapidly map stable, high-zT compositional spaces."

      "summary": "Multivalent ions exchange multiple electrons during redox reactions, leading to the possibility of improved energy storage performance. A variety of multivalent ions, including zinc (Zn$^{2+}$), magnesium (Mg$^{2+}$), calcium (Ca$^{2+}$), aluminum (Al$^{3+}$), and indium (In$^{3+}$), have been deployed in rechargeable batteries with varying degrees of success \\cite{1-9}. While chromium (Cr$^{3+}$) offers a superior volumetric capacity (approximately $11117\\ \\mathrm{mAh\\ cm^{-3}}$) compared to the aforementioned cations, there is no report of a rechargeable chromium battery. This is because chromium metal spontaneously oxidizes to form a passivating oxide layer \\cite{10} that blocks Cr$^{3+}$ ingress and egress. Here, we show that this fundamental limitation can be overcome by developing a chromium-rich high-entropy alloy. The alloy consists of five elements (Cr, bismuth (Bi), copper (Cu), tin (Sn), and nickel (Ni)), producing a multi-element native oxide rich in heterointerfaces. Some of these interfaces (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/Bi$_2$O$_3$) exhibit a very low barrier for Cr$^{3+}$ diffusion, offering multiple pathways for efficient Cr$^{3+}$ insertion and extraction, while others (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/CuO) block oxygen transport, thereby suppressing further oxidation. In a symmetric cell configuration, the chromium alloy supports approximately $10000$ hours (about $5000$ cycles) of reversible chromium insertion and extraction at an overpotential of only $20$ mV. The chromium-rich alloy anode was also successfully paired with a sulfur cathode to cycle reversibly in a full-cell configuration. These findings could stimulate fundamental studies on chromium-ion batteries and high-entropy alloy electrodes, opening new pathways for multivalent energy storage."

Furthermore, the form of $\\overline \\kappa(s)$ enables control over the instability's character; we find the forms for snapping with maximum energy release and at the lowest stimulation (both binary patterns) and design forms for symmetric and asymmetric switching pathways. Analogous control can also be achieved in boundary-driven instabilities of passive arches by fabricating them with suitable $\\overline \\kappa(s)$. We thus anticipate our results will improve switchable/snapping elements in MEMS, robotics, and mechanical meta-materials."

A key milestone for scaling this technology is the development of efficient superconducting memories. Such devices should be nonvolatile, scalable to high integration density and memory capacity, enable fast and low-power reading and writing operations, and be compatible with the digital logic. We present a versatile device platform to develop such nonvolatile memory devices consisting of an exchange-coupled ultra-thin superconductor encapsulated between two ferromagnetic insulators (FIs). The superconducting exchange coupling, which is tuneable by the relative alignment between the FI magnetizations, enables the switching of superconductivity on and off. We exploit this mechanism to create a superconducting nonvolatile memory where single-cell writing is realized using heat-assisted magnetic recording, and explain how it can become a contender for state-of-the-art superconducting memories. Furthermore, below their critical temperatures, the memory elements show a marked nonreciprocity, with zero magnetic field superconducting diode efficiencies exceeding $\\pm$60%, showing the versatility of the proposed devices for superconducting computing."

Two points ensure correctness and applicability. First, the Lindblad embedding is exact when the daughter kernel is interpreted in mass-weighted form (equivalently, when z*kappa(z) is a probability measure). Second, for genuinely non-Hermitian dynamics the stationary PSD is naturally a biorthogonal product of left and right ground states, not a naive modulus square; the usual modulus squared of psi appears only in pseudo-Hermitian or effectively dephased regimes. We then give a spectral dictionary linking typical PSD shapes to low-dimensional potential families in log-size space and outline inverse routes to infer effective potentials from data: parametric fitting with time-resolved PSDs, a direct steady-state inversion from a smoothed PSD, and an outlook toward inverse spectral ideas. A synthetic example demonstrates forward simulation and inverse parameter recovery in an Airy-type half-line model."

However, switching AFM domains is challenging, as magnetic fields do not couple to the bulk antiferromagnetic order parameter. Here we show that magnetic-field-driven switching of AFM domains can in many cases be enabled by a generic reduction of magnetic exchange at surfaces. We use statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that an inequivalence in magnetic exchange between top and bottom surface moments, combined with the enhanced magnetic susceptibility of surface spins, can enable deterministic selection of antiferromagnetic domains depending on the magnetic-field ramping direction. We further show that this mechanism provides a natural interpretation for experimental observations of hysteresis in magneto-optical response of the van der Waals AFM $\\mathrm{MnBi_2Te_4}$. Our findings highlight the critical role of surface spins in responses of antiferromagnets to magnetic fields. Furthermore, our results suggest that antiferromagnetic domain selection via purely magnetic means may be a more common and experimentally accessible phenomenon than previously assumed."

The ability to quickly, conclusively, and non-destructively detect the onset of spinodal decomposition before catastrophic materials degradation would represent a significant advance in materials testing. We demonstrate that spinodal decomposition can be detected in binary Fe-Cr alloys via modulus stiffening using in situ and ex situ transient grating spectroscopy (TGS). The key mechanistic insight is the non-linearity in elastic moduli as function of Cr content renders a spinodally decomposed Fe-Cr alloy stiffer than an equivalent solid solution for a certain range of initial chromium compositions. We confirm the presence of spinodal decomposition in the 36 at.% chromium alloy using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), linked to known spinodal decomposition energetics, and show via atomistic simulations that elastic modulus stiffening is expected after spinodal decomposition in the 36 at.% chromium alloy. The results of this study suggest the potential use of TGS as a practical tool for non-destructive evaluation of key materials susceptible to such degradation."

      "summary": "Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting resonators in quantum information science and precision measurements. Niobium resonators are widely used for these purposes, yet niobium's natural oxide stack contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \\ch{Nb2O5} and \\ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \\ch{Nb2O5} and \\ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \\ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits TLS-like power and temperature dependence. Analogous measurements performed on \\ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \\ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels"

Typical dislocation microstructures are strongly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity affects the motion of recrystallization boundaries. In this study, a phase field model for microstructure evolution encompassing the evolution of both dislocation densities and grain order parameters is formulated. The model is employed to generate typical dislocation microstructures exhibiting multiscale features such as incidental and geometrically necessary dislocation walls.

Despite being hidden behind either purely magnetic or elastic behavior, magnetoelasticity takes place in a wide range of devices as transducers, acoustic actuators, or fast response sensors. In this work, we inspect the impact of higher-order terms on the anisotropic magnetostriction behavior. Regarding ab-initio calculations, the anisotropic magnetostriction can be related to the strain dependence of the magnetocrystaline energy. Commonly, the description is restricted to a linear strain dependence in the magnetoelastic energy. Here, we derive higher-order terms in strain for bcc and fcc crystal structures. Using a simple parametrization, we show that the influence of the higher-order strain terms is negligible for the studied cubic systems."

Here, we develop an ultrasound-assisted, two-stage emulsification strategy to generate water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) multiple emulsions with sufficient stability to function as templates for forming drug-rich submicron particulates. We first establish an operating window using simple W/O emulsions, showing that increased Tween~80 concentration and intensified sonication (higher amplitude and larger probe) yield smaller droplets and reduced coarsening tendencies. Using this window, W/O/W emulsions are formulated and systematically screened via surfactant pairing across ionic, non-ionic, and polymeric stabilizers. Ionic--non-ionic combinations provide the most favorable droplet-size control, with CTAB--Tween~80 emerging as a practically robust formulation. Cyclohexane was selected as a reproducible platform oil for downstream precipitation using the lead CTAB--Tween~80 formulation. Finally, curcumin-loaded W/O/W constructs generate curcumin-rich submicron particulates, supporting multiple emulsions as experimentally accessible microstructured environments for particle engineering of poorly soluble drugs."

ICL allows a system to infer task-specific rules from a sequence of examples without relying solely on fixed parameters. Traditional ICL relies on a pairwise attention mechanism which is not obviously implementable in chemical systems. However, we show theoretically and numerically that chemical processes can achieve ICL through a mechanism we call subspace projection, in which the entire input vector is mapped onto comparison subspaces, with the dominant projection determining the computational output. We illustrate this mechanism analytically in small chemical systems and show numerically that performance is robust to input encoding and dynamical choices, with the number of tunable degrees of freedom in the input encoding as a key limitation. Our results provide a blueprint for realizing ICL in chemical or other physical media and suggest new directions for designing adaptive synthetic chemical systems and understanding possible biological computation in cells."

Microstructural investigation is performed using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The tetravalent oxidation state of tantalum is confirmed using X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy as well as electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Optical properties are investigated via spectroscopic ellipsometry and reveal a 0.3 eV Mott gap of the tantalum 5d electrons. Density-functional theory and group theoretical arguments are used to evaluate the limited stability of the rutile phase and reveal the potential to unlock a hidden metal-insulator transition concomitant with a structural phase transition to a distorted rutile phase, akin to NbO2.

The influence of SiO2 and CaO sintering aids on the optical properties and microstructure of Cr,Ca:YAG ceramics was investigated. A decrease in CaO concentration led to a reduction of Cr,Ca:YAG transparency from 81 to 0 percent at 1064 nm; moreover, ceramics with lower CaO content exhibited abnormal grains and high porosity. These features were attributed to interactions between silica and calcium oxide during vacuum sintering. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the effect of CaO and SiO2 on the formation of Ca,Cr:YAG ceramics. The first involves the formation of a liquid phase due to the CaO-SiO2 interaction during the heating stage, resulting in abnormal grain growth. The second mechanism is the mutual consumption of Si4+ and Ca2+ ions during the isothermal stage of sintering, which leads to a decrease in Cr4+ concentration. Both mechanisms negatively affect the optical and laser properties of the ceramics."

Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity. These findings may provide guidance for experimental exploration of altermagnetism-induced FFLO states in real materials with more complex electronic structures."

Recent theoretical and experimental progress has laid the groundwork for understanding magnetic skyrmions characterized by negligible net magnetization and ultrafast dynamics. Notably, skyrmions emerging in materials with altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase featuring lifted Kramers degeneracy-have remained unreported until now. In this study, we demonstrate that BiFeO3, a multiferroic renowned for its strong coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism, can transit from a spin cycloid to a Neel-type skyrmion under antidamping spin-orbit torque at room temperature. Strikingly, the altermagnetic spin splitting within BiFeO3 skyrmion can be reversed through the application of an electric field, revealed via the Circular photogalvanic effect. This quasiparticle, which possesses a neutral topological charge, holds substantial promise for diverse applications-most notably, enabling the development of unconventional computing systems with low power consumption and magnetoelectric controllability."

      "summary": "The rapid adhesion of motile bacteria from dilute suspensions poses a fundamental non-equilibrium problem: hydrodynamic interactions bias bacterial motion near surfaces without generating stable confinement, while electrostatic interactions are predominantly repulsive. Here, combining experiments on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in a polyethylene glycol/dextran aqueous two-phase system with large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we identify wetting-coupled liquid--liquid phase separation (LLPS) as an energetic trapping mechanism for bacterial adhesion. When bacteria partition into a phase that preferentially wets the substrate, interfacial free-energy minimization creates a deep energetic trap that stabilizes adhesion and induces lateral clustering via capillary interactions. Crucially, bacterial motility plays a dual role: at low phase volume fractions, activity enhances transport into the wetting layer and promotes accumulation, whereas at higher phase volumes it suppresses adhesion through the formation of self-spinning droplets that generate hydrodynamic lift opposing interfacial trapping. Our results establish wetting-coupled LLPS as a generic physical route governing interfacial organization in active suspensions. This provides a unified energetic framework for bacterial adhesion in complex fluids, with broad implications for deciphering bacterial-cell interactions and controlling biofilm formation."

Despite coming from the backfolding of the acoustic phonons of the individual layers, many of these modes become infrared active when the system is doped. We illustrate this effect by a direct calculation of the optical absorption of twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) around different twist angles, including the magic angle. Several modes -including the acoustic-like phason- acquire a dipole moment via interband matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) when the flat band is filled or emptied, giving rise to new resonances in the optical conductivity within the single-electron gap that are strongly affected by relaxation. The phason in particular gains a charge that equals the amount of electrons per moir\\'e cell added/removed to/from neutrality. Geometrically, this can be understood as the topological quantization of a sliding Chern number. The charged phason yields a Drude-like conductivity with an effective mass that increases with lattice relaxation. Our findings are testable via THz spectroscopy, and provide an experimental knob to characterize EPC strength and disorder in moir\\'e materials at small twist angles."

      "summary": "Recently, the topic of altermagnetism has attracted tremendous attention and RuO2 have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising altermagnetic candidates. However, disputes still remain on the existence of magnetic order in RuO2. Here in this work, we employ X-ray linear dichroism (XLD), a widely utilized technique for characterizing antiferromagnets, in conjunction with photoemission electron microscopy and multiple scattering calculation to provide clear evidence of the absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 films. The observed XLD signal is nearly invariant with temperature and independent on cooling field direction, in stark contrast to the substantial magnetic order-related XLD signal predicted by multiple scattering calculation. This finding strongly suggests a nonmagnetic origin for RuO2. Furthermore, we observed significantly distinct XLD signals at the Ru M3 and O K edges in RuO2 films grown on TiO2 substrate with different surface orientations, which can be attributed to the low-symmetry crystal field. These results unequivocally demonstrate the absence of magnetic order in RuO2 and establishes XLD measurement as a robust technique for probing the low-symmetry magnetic materials."

These inverse analyses were used to reconstruct solvation structures near solid surfaces and density distribution profiles of colloidal particles. In the course of these studies, we developed a method that enables inverse analyses through a unified and systematic procedure, hereafter referred to as the Probability Density Alternation (PDA) method. The central idea of this method is to reformulate a given integral equation in terms of probability density functions. In this letter, we demonstrate the validity of the PDA method both analytically and numerically. While the PDA method is less advantageous for single integral equations, it becomes a convenient and powerful approach for inverse analyses involving double or higher-order integral equations."

Here, we present Bgolearn, a comprehensive Python framework that makes BO accessible and practical for materials research through an intuitive interface, robust algorithms, and materials-oriented workflows. Bgolearn supports both single-objective and multi-objective Bayesian optimization with multiple acquisition functions (e.g., expected improvement, upper confidence bound, probability of improvement, and expected hypervolume improvement etc.), diverse surrogate models (including Gaussian processes, random forests, and gradient boosting etc.), and bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. Benchmark studies show that Bgolearn reduces the number of required experiments by 40-60% compared with random search, grid search, and genetic algorithms, while maintaining comparable or superior solution quality. Its effectiveness is demonstrated not only through the studies presented in this paper, such as the identification of maximum-elastic-modulus triply periodic minimal surface structures, ultra-high-hardness high-entropy alloys, and high-strength, high-ductility medium-Mn steels, but also by numerous publications that have proven its impact in material discovery. With a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly into existing materials workflows and a graphical user interface (BgoFace) that removes programming barriers, Bgolearn establishes a practical and reliable platform for Bayesian optimization in materials science, and is openly available at https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn."

      "summary": "Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCA) exhibit exceptional strength and thermal stability, yet their plastic deformation mechanisms under complex contact loading remain insufficiently understood. Here, the nanoindentation response of an equiatomic MoTaW alloy is investigated through a combined experimental and atomistically resolved modeling approach. Spherical nanoindentation experiments are coupled with large scale molecular dynamics simulations employing a tabulated low dimensional Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), enabling near DFT accuracy. A physics based similarity criterion, implemented via PCA of load-displacement curves, is used to identify mechanically representative experimental responses for quantitative comparison with simulations. Indentation stress-strain curves are constructed yielding excellent agreement in the elastic regime between experiment and simulation, with reduced Young's moduli of approximately 270 GPa. Generalized stacking fault energy calculations reveal elevated unstable stacking- and twinning-fault energies in MoTaW relative to pure refractory elements, indicating suppressed localized shear and a preference for dislocation-mediated plasticity. Atomistic analyses demonstrate a strong crystallographic dependence of plastic deformation, with symmetric {110} slip activation and four-fold rosette pile-ups for the [001] orientation, and anisotropic slip, strain localization, and enhanced junction formation for [011]. Local entropy and polyhedral template matching analyses further elucidate dislocation network evolution and deformation-induced local structural transformations. Overall, this study establishes a direct mechanistic link between fault energetics, orientation-dependent dislocation activity, and experimentally observed nanoindentation behavior in RCCA."

Solid solutions enable tuning various material properties, such as the optoelectronic behavior of halide perovskites. In bulk, incompatibility of Cl:I halide mixtures restricts exploration throughout the ternary halide Cl:Br:I compositional range. However, solubility is extended in nanocrystals which better accommodate a wider range of ions within their lattice. Through high throughput synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of over 3000 samples, along with density functional theory and cluster expansion models, we determine the solubility boundaries of ternary halide perovskite nanocrystals and demonstrate their extended size dependent miscibility. Smaller nanocrystals, with sufficient Br content, stabilize the Cl:Br:I solid solutions, suppress planar stacking fault defects and prevent halide segregation."

In this work, we investigate interface-state trapping using Hall-bar field-effect transistors fabricated on strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures. Combining transport measurements with long-term stabilization and Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson modelling, we reconstruct the gradual filling process of interface states at cryogenic condition. Using the calculated valence band profiles, we further evaluate the tunneling current density between the quantum well and the semiconductor-oxide interface. Our calculation demonstrates that the total tunneling current is consistent with a crossover from trap-assisted-tunneling-dominated transport to Fowler-Nordheim-tunneling-dominated transport under different gate bias regimes. These results refine the conventional Fowler-Nordheim-based picture of interface trapping in strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures and provide guidelines for improving Ge-based quantum device performance by improving barrier crystalline qualities and reducing dislocation-related trap densities."

Starting from a product state of two distinguishable spin-1/2 particles, we provide a direct way to capture crucial geometric information. This perspective reveals the fundamental interplay between subspace projection and geometric constraints. This approach effectively maps magnetic solitons onto a kink model, allowing us to derive their equations of motion, a task not readily achieved with traditional methods. This simplified dynamical description reveals that the novel transition of these solitons in a harmonic trap corresponds to a fundamental transformation between kink and dip structures in the underlying geometry."

Here, we demonstrate that the NQS loss landscape is more benign and similar to conventional deep learning than previously thought, exhibiting mode connectivity: independently trained NQS are connected by paths in parameter space with essentially no energy barrier. To construct these paths, we develop GeoNEB, a path optimizer integrating efficient stochastic reconfiguration with the nudged elastic band method for constructing minimum energy paths. For the strongly interacting six-electron quantum dot modeled by a $1.6$M-parameter Psiformer, we find two independent minima with expected energy barrier $\\sim10^{-5}$ times smaller than the system's overall energy scale and $\\sim10^{-3}$ times smaller than the linear path's barrier. The path respects physical symmetry in addition to achieving low energy, with the angular momentum remaining well quantized throughout. Our work is the first to construct optimized paths between independently trained NQS, and it suggests that the NQS loss landscape may not be as pathological as once feared."

      "summary": "A recently proposed generalised continuum theory of curved dislocations describes the spatial and temporal evolution of statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocation densities as well as the curvature. The dynamics follow from a scalar plastic potential that constrains the allowed velocity fields and leads to a phase field like formulation with a nontrivial mobility function. Although conceptually related to strain gradient plasticity, the theory differs by introducing an intrinsic, evolving length scale given by the dislocation spacing. In this paper, we determine three key material independent parameters of this continuum theory by quantitatively comparing its predictions with discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. To achieve this, we impose a narrow impenetrable wall inside the simulation volume, which blocks dislocation motion and generates characteristic spatial variations of the dislocation density fields under external loading. We show that for this geometry, the continuum equations reduce to a form that can be solved efficiently via direct numerical integration. The resulting stationary distributions of total and geometrically necessary dislocation densities are then compared to extensive 2D and 3D DDD simulations. This comparison allows us to extract the parameters that govern the back stress, the density gradient coupling, and the flow stress relation. Our results demonstrate that the continuum theory quantitatively captures the DDD observed structure of the dislocation pile up near the wall and therefore provides a reliable mesoscale description. The wall loading setup further serves as a benchmark problem to validate numerical implementations of the continuum theory in more general geometries."

Unlike the type-I hyperbolic lattices where zero-energy cornerlike states exist on a single boundary, the higher-order topological phases in type-II hyperbolic lattices possess zero-energy cornerlike states localized on both the inner and outer boundaries. These findings are verified within both the modified Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model and the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model.

      "summary": "The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics. Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness. Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics."

These bounds remain robust even in regimes where quantum effects break classical thermodynamic uncertainty relations. We demonstrate their validity by using boxcar transmission functions and further derive constraints on the power output from the perspective of fluctuations and dissipation, offering a unified thermodynamic guideline for the design and evaluation of nanoscale and quantum thermal devices."

Furthermore, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to probe the structure and chemical bonding. The core-level photoemission analysis reveals the Cr$^{3+}$ and mixed Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation states in the sample. Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. These findings highlight key challenges in achieving stable, reversible capacity in this system and underscore the need for doping, structural modification, and electrolyte optimization to realize its full potential as a high-voltage SIB cathode."

In addition to highlighting the importance of these properties for superconducting electronics, this review gives an overview over the physical mechanisms that govern and influence superconductivity in vdW materials including Ising pairing, band inversion, and proximity effects at superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces that do not have an equivalent in thin-film systems. This overview then sets the basis to survey the wide range of functionalities enabled by superconducting vdW devices including gate-controlled devices, superconducting diodes, and circuit elements for readout and control of quantum bits. The review concludes with a forward look at wafer-scale growth and deterministic assembly of vdW devices, highlighting concrete pathways that can enable the transition from vdW device prototypes to deployable components for cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies."

Here, we present the bottom-up synthesis of a non-centrosymmetric GNR that places all ZMs on the majority sublattice sites. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy reveal that strong electron-electron correlation drives the system into a ferromagnetically ordered insulating ground state featuring a sizeable band gap of Eg ~ 1.2 eV. At higher temperatures, a chemical transformation induces an insulator-to-metal transition that quenches the ferro-magnetic order. Tight-binding (TB) and first-principles density functional theory calculations corroborate our experimental observations.

Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term \\emph{dynamic redundancy and mortality} (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems."

However, the evolution of the microstructure and morphology near the percolation threshold, and its connection to the resulting magnetic and magnetotransport behavior in low-dimensional magnetic heterostructures, remain poorly understood. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties of Si/Fe bilayers by varying the Fe layer thickness. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and magnetisation data reveal a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to percolative network structure of grains when tFe decreases below 30 Angstrom. Transport measurements involving longitudinal resistivity (rho), and the anomalous Hall resistivity (rho_A,h,s) show clear divergence near the percolation threshold. The purely electronic conduction channels (rho) evolve more gradually as compared to the combined electronic and magnetic ones rho_A,h,s. The percolative analysis of the structural, magnetic, and magnetotransport data yields a critical exponent in the range of 0.78 to 1.16, consistent with that of 2D-disordered systems. The AHE scaling relation between the rho_A,h,s and rho reveals a crossover of the AHE mechanism from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution with a minor skew scattering component (n ~ 1.42) in the thick, low-resistive samples (tFe > 30 Angstrom) to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism (n = 0.62) in the high-resistive films (tFe <= 30 Angstrom). This crossover coincides with the onset of structural and magnetic connectivity between the grains. Furthermore, these findings underscore the interlink between microstructure, morphology, magnetism, and Hall transport under a percolation framework."

      "summary": "Half-metals, featuring ideal 100\\% spin polarization, are widely regarded as key materials for spintronic and quantum technologies; however, the half-metallic state is intrinsically fragile, as it relies on a delicate balance of exchange splitting and band filling and is therefore highly susceptible to disorder, external perturbations, and thermal effects. Here we introduce the concept of hidden half-metallicity, whereby the global electronic structure of a symmetry-enforced net-zero-magnetization magnet is non-half-metallic, while each of its two symmetry-related sectors is individually half-metallic, enabling robust 100\\% spin polarization through a layer degree of freedom. Crucially, the vanishing net magnetization of the entire system suppresses stray fields and magnetic instabilities, rendering the half-metallic functionality inherently more robust than in conventional ferromagnetic half-metals. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate this mechanism in a $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\\mathrm{CrS_2}$, and further show that an external electric field drives the system into a seemingly forbidden fully compensated ferrimagnetic metal in which hidden half-metallicity persists. Finally, we briefly confirm the realization of hidden half-metallicity in altermagnets, establishing a general paradigm for stabilizing half-metallic behavior by embedding it in symmetry-protected hidden sectors and opening a new route toward the design and discovery of unprecedented half-metallic phases."

      "summary": "Motivated by recent advances in the study of altermagnetism, or unconventional magnetism, and in the realization and manipulation of two-impurity Kondo physics in real materials, we propose a phase-sensitive method to explore unconventional magnetic symmetries. Our method can be implemented with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to study two-impurity Kondo phenomena on altermagnetic metals by varying the distance and orientation between magnetic impurities. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the spin splitting of the Kondo resonance, whose spatial distribution sensitively captures the symmetry of the underlying altermagnetic order. Furthermore, the impurity spin correlations reflects the anisotropy of the RKKY interaction due to the altermagnetic Fermi surface splitting. This work provides a framework for studying the competition between the Kondo effect, the RKKY interaction and altermagnetism, in the simplest possible system."

Ga$^+$-ion-focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling has been introduced as an available method for fabricating SNVM, while the probe diameter is limited to a few micrometers due to the Ga$^+$-induced damage.

      "summary": "Defect related disorder during InN growth is a major challenge for making high performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. This is partly because film quality is often described using reactor specific settings instead of general physical variables. In this study, we show that plasma assisted MOCVD growth of InN can be described using a single thermodynamic driving force coordinate. This coordinate brings together growth kinetics, defect sensitive Raman response and structural coherence across different process conditions. When we use this coordinate, the incorporation rate follows a universal activated trend with a kinetic scale of about 0.08 eV. Raman measurements show a clear crossover between a defect sparse and a defect rich regime, a disorder activated Raman metric increases quickly after the crossover, while an A1-LO control metric stays mostly the same. This suggests that short range lattice disorder, not long range polar coupling, dominates the defect activation process. X-ray diffraction shows that the out of plane coherence length stays the same for samples with the same driving force, even if reactor settings are very different. This supports the idea that structural coherence is organized by thermodynamics in this growth window. Finally, a simple kinetic Monte Carlo model using driving force biased incorporation and defect activation events matches the observed exponential trends and the two regimes, supporting the driving force approach. These results show that a transferable driving force coordinate can be used for plasma assisted InN growth and offer a quantitative way to achieve defect sparse growth conditions."

      "summary": "The design of quantum states at heterointerfaces has enabled a variety of emergent phenomena. Among them, molecular intercalation superlattices have attracted attention as tunable hybrid materials, formed by inserting organic molecules into van der Waals crystals, where molecular structure and chemistry provide new degrees of freedom. Traditionally, the intercalated molecules have been regarded as inactive spacers, while possible molecular ordering and its impact on the host lattice have remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a cooperative superstructure (CSS) phase in molecule intercalated NbSe2, where ordering of the guest molecules induce a concomitant superstructure in the NbSe2 host lattice, characterized by a moir\\'e structure due to incommensurability between the molecular layer and the inorganic lattice. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals the emergence of CSS phase, accompanied by crystal symmetry lowering. Complementary resistivity and thermal-quench measurements show that the transition is governed by unusually slow order-disorder kinetics, so that the CSS phase can be selectively accessed under standard laboratory cooling rates. This kinetic behavior arises from slow molecular dynamics coupled to the host lattice, contrasting with fast charge or magnetic ordering in inorganic solids. Our findings establish molecular ordering as a route for engineering heterointerfaces, enabling thermally programmable superstructures."

The generalized AMB+ differs from the original AMB+ introduced by Tjhung \\textit{et al.} [E. Tjhung \\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. X \\textbf{8}, 031080 (2018)] by the addition of a quadratic term, $g\\phi^2$, in the expression for the equilibrium part of the current. Also, the model includes a rotation-free active current of strength $\\lambda$ and a rotational current of strength $\\xi$. The inclusion of a chemical reaction with rate $\\Gamma$ removes the conservation constraint and introduces a preferred wavenumber that governs the pattern formation below a critical reaction rate $\\Gamma_c$. We argue for the analytical form of the amplitude equation based on symmetry considerations and explicitly derived it using multiscale analysis. By taking different limits of $g$, $\\lambda$, and $\\xi$, we recover amplitude equations for several well-known physical models as special cases and determine the nature transitions close to the onset of instability. We find that for $g = 0$, the transition is always supercritical, whereas for $g \\ne 0$, the transition between the supercritical and subcritical regimes depends sensitively on the model parameters. Further, we derive the condition for the \\textit{Eckhaus instability} from the stability analysis of the amplitude equation as well as from the phase diffusion equation, and find that it is independent of $g$."

We investigate its Anderson localization properties under diagonal binary disorder. For weak disorder, the complex eigenvalue spectrum forms a single closed loop, which bifurcates into two distinct loops at a critical disorder threshold. Correspondingly, the spectral winding number {\\nu} undergoes a transition from {\\nu} = 1 in the weak-disorder regime, through {\\nu} = 1/2 at the critical point, to {\\nu} = 0 in the strong-disorder limit. We show that the eigenstates are exponentially localized, with a localization length that varies analytically as a function of the loop parameter. Notably, at weak and critical disorder, the spectrum hosts two completely delocalized states with diverging localization lengths. This divergence is directly correlated with the non-trivial spectral winding number. These findings remain robust under various boundary conditions, with the exception of strictly open boundaries."

We identify a soft acoustic phonon driving the incommensurate CDW (I-CDW) and uncover a second Kohn anomaly at the wave vector of the commensurate CDW (C-CDW) stabilized in other $R$NiC$_2$ members ($R=$ rare earth). The marked softening of both phonons and their contrasting evolution with temperature reveal a competition between the two ordering tendencies. Alongside pronounced anomalies in the temperature dependence of the zone center and soft phonons, we observe the collective amplitude mode of the CDW, which collapses abruptly as ferromagnetism sets in. Surprisingly, the Kohn anomalies persist in the ferromagnetic state despite the degradation of Fermi-surface nesting conditions. Our experimental findings, supported by ab initio calculations, highlight the central role of the electron-phonon interaction in driving the CDW formation and tuning the balance between competing charge and magnetic orders."

The sintering regimes were chosen so that the ceramics had the relative density of 97-99% and a bimodal distribution of the microstructure parameters. The Al2O3 and Al2O3 + 0.25%MgO ceramics obtained in Regimes I-III had a microstructure with abnormally large grains in a fine-grained matrix. The sizes and volume fractions of the large grains depended on the sintering regime. Most abnormally large grains had elongated shapes that leads to deviations in the crack propagation trajectories from the straight line. The optimal parameters of the bimodal microstructure parameters distribution providing enhanced mechanical properties of the ceramics (hardness, indentation fracture toughness, ultimate strength) have been determined."

From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate os- cillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching. Without FLT, the frequency of the oscilla- tions decreases with the current while the power of oscillations increases. In the presence of the negative strength of the FLT the power spectral density confirms that the frequency, power and the Q-factor increase with the current. Also the tunability range and the rate at which the frequency enhances increase with the magnitude of the FLT."

      "summary": "We investigate the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on spherical Fibonacci graphs. These graphs are constructed by embedding quasi-uniform sites on a sphere and defining interactions via a chord-distance cutoff chosen to yield a network approximating four-neighbor connectivity. By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q>4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length."

      "summary": "When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery."

In this context, Janus polymersomes are particularly attractive for synthetic cell development and drug delivery systems. While they can be achieved by inducing a phase separation within their membrane, their fabrication method remains largely empirical. Here, we propose a rational approach, using Flory-Huggins theory, to predict the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. Our predictions are experimentally validated by forming highly stable Janus giant unilamellar vesicles (JGUVs) with a remarkable yield exceeding 90% obtained from electroformation of various biocompatible block copolymers. We also present a general phase diagram correlating mixing energy with polymersome morphology, offering a valuable tool for JGUV design. These polymersomes can be extruded to achieve quasi-monodisperse vesicles while maintaining their Janus-like morphology, paving the way for their asymmetric functionalization and use as active carriers."

      "summary": "An incommensurate CDW may have the ability to slide, i.e., to generate an excess of current when the system is submitted to an external field. Sliding phenomenon is closely related to deformation of the periodic lattice distortion associated to the CDW. In principle, however, the sliding state can also be observed through the band structure. Here we show that broken symmetry in k-space is observed by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) in the sliding regime of TbTe$_3$, which could be consistent with theoretical predictions."

      "summary": "In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, collinear magnets are classified as even-wave magnets, i.e., either ferro-, antiferro-, or altermagnets. It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets. Our work provides a new perspective on collinear magnets and the spin-space group classification."

Although most studies examine this process in planar films, confinement within micron-sized water-in-oil droplets provides a powerful platform for resolving self-assembly dynamics in real time. Here, we investigate how two common pitch-tuning strategies, sodium chloride addition and tip sonication, govern the kinetics and structure of CNC self-assembly under spherical confinement. Polarized optical microscopy timelapses capture the evolution from isotropic suspension through tactoid nucleation and annealing to kinetic arrest and final buckling. Consistent with prior work, pitch-concentration analysis reveals a universal post-arrest regime governed by droplet shrinkage. Beyond this established behavior, we identify a pre-arrest regime in which pitch decreases rapidly and whose kinetics accelerate with increasing salt concentration and sonication dose. These parameters shift the onset of cholesteric order and gelation, thereby tuning the concentration window for tactoid coalescence. Together, these results establish droplet confinement as a quantitative platform for probing out-of-equilibrium CNC self-assembly and for kinetically programming structurally colored soft materials."

The candidate topological superconductor PdTe has recently been proposed to host a nodeless surface gap on top of a nodal bulk state, but their direct identification and mutual coupling remained experimentally elusive. Here, we employ magnetic-field-dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy to spectroscopically disentangle these components. At zero magnetic field, the spectra exhibit a BCS-like gap structure, consistent with dominant transport through a fully gapped surface superconducting state. Strikingly, even a weak magnetic field leads to an abrupt suppression of the Andreev-enhanced conductance (AEC), while a residual AEC, attributable to the nodal bulk state, persists to much higher magnetic fields. The transition is accompanied by pronounced magnetic hysteresis pointing to the existence of vortex dynamics at low fields. Our findings suggest that the nodal bulk gap facilitates early vortex entry, which in turn disrupts the fragile surface superconductivity. These results establish a field-tunable decoupling of surface and bulk superconductivity and illustrate how distinct gap topologies can shape the global superconducting order in multichannel systems."

Supported by first-principles calculations and drift-diffusion modeling, we show that tip-controlled oxygen vacancy electromigration plays a key role. This advancement bridges reconfigurable device fabrication and concurrent characterization in situ at mK temperatures, and establishes a versatile Hubbard toolbox for engineering programmable quantum phases in correlated oxides."

      "summary": "Protein phase transitions govern numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. In Parkinson's disease, distinct species of the protein alpha-synuclein undergo phase transitions from highly disordered to ordered beta-rich states. The emerging species and transitions between them can be reshaped by chaperones, small molecules, peptides or antibodies. Here, we use coarse-grained simulations to understand the effect of modulators on the thermodynamics and kinetics of alpha-synuclein transformations and phase transitions. Each protein is represented as a single morphing particle that transforms from a soft sphere (disordered state) to a hard spherocylinder (beta-rich state), while modulators are modeled as soft isotropic particles mimicking small peptides. The results show that purely repulsive modulators do not alter the final outcome, i.e. fibrils form following the same mechanisms independently of the modulator concentration. Attractive interactions towards the disordered protein slow down fibril formation in a dose-dependent manner by stabilizing intermediate species, and strong attraction yields persistent disordered heteroclusters. In contrast, specific attraction to the beta-rich state results in shorter fibrils through direct modulator surface \"capping\" that introduce kinetic barriers to monomer templating at the fibril ends and inhibit lateral attachment. Together, these results link modulator properties and environmental conditions to the effects on nucleation, fibril elongation and off-pathway trapping, providing a quantitative roadmap for selecting modulator properties and strategies that redirect phase transitions toward desirable endpoints. Additionally, they provide guiding principles for the development of intervention strategies and the engineering of novel materials with tunable and responsive properties."

Conventional syntheses of ZnS quantum dots (QDs) often involve high temperatures or toxic reagents. This study presents a comparative investigation of hydrothermal and co-precipitation synthesis routes for ZnS QDs, emphasizing scalable, environmentally friendly production under mild conditions. Using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as capping agents, we achieved precise control over particle size, optical properties, and particle size distribution. Room temperature co-precipitation produced monodisperse ZnS QDs with crystallite size as small as 2.03 nm, while hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature yielded larger crystals exceeding ~6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed zinc-blende crystal structure in all samples, with lattice parameter shifts and peak broadening reflecting nanoscale effects. UV-Visible spectroscopy revealed tuneable optical band gaps from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, corresponding to strong quantum confinement in smaller particles. FTIR and DLS analyses verified effective surface capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing greater growth suppression and stability than PEG. These results demonstrate that ambient, polymer-assisted co precipitation enables low-toxicity, energy-efficient synthesis of high-quality ZnS QDs, offering a viable route toward sustainable and scalable nanoparticle production for optoelectronic and nanomaterial applications"

GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena."

Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials."

Here we demonstrate both experimentally and numerically, that the success of such a strategy may heavily rely on the type of policy adopted by the robots, as well as on the details of the physical design. To do so, we consider a swarm of robots, composed of Kilobots embedded in an exoskeleton, the design of which controls the propensity of the robots to align or anti-align with the direction of the external force they experience. We find experimentally that the contrast that was observed between the two morphologies in the success rate of a simple phototactic task, where the robots were programmed to stop when entering a light region, becomes dramatic, if the robots are not allowed to stop, and can only slow down. Building on a faithful physical model of the self-aligning dynamics of the robots, we perform numerical simulations and demonstrate on one hand that a precise tuning of the self-aligning strength around a sweet spot is required to achieve an efficient phototactic behavior, on the other hand that exploring a range of self-alignment strength allows for a rich expressivity of collective behaviors."

In the presence of synthetic gauge field, spatial symmetries should be projectively represented, which can modify the Brillouin manifold. However, this is often overlooked in non-Hermitian systems. Here, we present that momentum-space non-symmorphic reflection symmetry, a typical projective symmetry, induce exceptional topology and the nonlocal skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian electric circuit. We observe the total topological charges 2, rather than 0, for all exceptional points in a Brillouin Klein bottle manifold, and the phase transition when an exceptional point crosses the antiparallel boundary and flips its topological charge. We further observe a novel skin effect that the skin modes at one side are nonlocally connected to those on the opposite side separated by half of the reciprocal lattice. Our results unveil the unique non-Hermitian phenomena enabled by the projective symmetry, and open avenues for exploring the non-Hermitian topology beyond Brillouin torus manifold."

      "summary": "We investigate the structure and dynamics of a hard colloid--star polymer mixture in the range of its arrested phase separation, where an incipient demixing transition is interfering with a nearby vitrification line, focusing on the protein limit (smaller hard component). Soft-hard mixtures present a rich dynamics, influenced by different parameters such as the concentration of the soft and hard components, the softness of the potential, and the size ratio between the two components. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize the single-particle and collective dynamics of the hard colloidal tracers in the soft glassy matrix. The hard tracers show diffusive behavior of the mean squared displacement accompanied by non-exponential relaxation of the intermediate scattering functions at intermediate length scales and non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Moreover, we show that the system exhibits arrested phase separation, leading to population splitting and decoupling between self- and collective dynamics of the hard colloids. Overall, we demonstrate that the interplay between arrested phase separation and glassiness leads to complex, multiscale phenomena that strongly influence the dynamics of the hard additives in the arrested matrix formed by the soft colloids."

      "summary": "The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society."

This makes Mg of interest for biocompatible degradable body implants, provided that its high corrosion rate can be inhibited. Slightly alloying Mg and adding surface coatings can slow down the corrosion processes without significantly changing the mechanical properties. Use of coating molecules that are native to the body increase the likelihood of making the surface biocompatible, for example by use of amino acids. We here present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption on Mg(0001) of the amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-hydroxyproline (Hyp), the main amino acid content of collagen. We investigate how binding of the functional groups of Hyp are affected when Mg(0001) is slightly alloyed with zinc, lithium or aluminium, and we also model the immersion of the systems in a water environment to see how this affects the binding."

The denoising performance is quantified by comparison to similar simulated data and the approach is found to significantly outperform both total variation and simple Gaussian blurring.

To study physical phenomena and design new materials, it is important to possess an appropriate tool, a model allowing simulation of desired behavior. Spin-lattice model simulations can be used to investigate spacious systems containing thousands of atoms, while complex phenomena arising from the interplay of lattice and spin dynamics can be modeled. One of the important phenomena that can be modeled in the spin lattice simulation is magnetoelastic behavior, offering direct conversion between the mechanical and magnetic energy. However, so far, only models for systems with cubic symmetry have been introduced. Therefore, here, a spin-lattice model for a system with tetragonal symmetry is proposed, where its strength is manifested by simulation of magnetoelastic properties of a characteristic representative L1$_{0}$ FePt system."

We used soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the successive changes in PrNiO$_x$ thin films at various intermediate stages of topotactic reduction with $x=2-3$. By comparing the Ni-$L$ edge spectra to single and double cluster ligand-field calculations, we find that none of our samples exhibit a pure $d^9$ configuration. Our quantitative analysis using the charge sum rule shows that even when films are maximally reduced, the averaged number of nickel $3d$ holes is 1.35. Superconducting samples have even higher values, calling into question the previously assumed limit of hole doping. Concomitant changes in the oxygen $K$-edge absorption spectra upon reduction indicate the presence of oxygen $2p$ holes, even in the most reduced films. Overall, our results suggest a complex interplay of hole doping mechanisms resulting from self-doping effects and oxygen non-stoichiometry."

The magnetic moments of the leads are analyzed in both parallel and antiparallel configurations. A tight-binding Hamiltonian and the Green's function formalism are employed to calculate the spin-resolved thermoelectric properties of the system as functions of geometrical confinement and vacancy concentration. The results demonstrate an enhancement in charge and spin-dependent thermopower, resulting in an improved thermoelectric efficiency at room temperature, which overcomes the limitations imposed by the classical Wiedemann-Franz law. These findings indicate that defective silicene nanoribbons are promising platforms for the development of efficient thermoelectric and spin-caloritronic devices."

In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schr\\\"odinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schr\\\"odinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches."

Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses."

      "summary": "Understanding how microorganisms navigate in complex environments is a central question in active matter and biological physics. Phototaxis - the ability to use light as a navigation cue - is a widespread strategy in motile microalgae to optimise photosynthesis and avoid light-induced stress. The microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for studying this behaviour, where navigation is classically attributed to a photosensitive organelle named eyespot. While this mechanism enables cells to sense the direction of incoming light, their response to light intensity gradients remains less understood. Here we show that structured light landscapes can guide microalgae populations and localise them in defined spatial regions. By analysing single-cell trajectories, we find that cells actively steer relative to the local light gradient, and a comparison with a minimal theoretical model shows that a short-time memory of light exposure acting on the transition between positive and negative phototaxis is necessary to reproduce the observed accumulation. At longer times, we observe a gradual decrease in cell number density within the trapping region, consistent with phototactic adaptation. Beyond controlling population dynamics, our results reveal new aspects of phototactic behaviour, highlighting gradient-aligned steering together with temporal integration as central mechanisms for navigation in structured environments."

We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy."

Although optical manipulation of magnetism in metals has been extensively studied, experimentally demonstrated effects have so far been limited to heat-driven dynamics or helicity-dependent mechanisms. Here, we report ultrafast non-thermal control of spin order in noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn-based antiperovskite nitrides Mn3NiN and Mn3GaN, driven solely by the polarization orientation of linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulses. Using time-resolved magneto-optical pump-probe experiments based on the Voigt effect, we observe sub-picosecond changes in magnetic order followed by picosecond relaxation. The magneto-optical response depends on the relative orientation of the pump and probe polarization planes, with linear-polarization dependence reaching up to 95%, a value unprecedented in metallic magnets. This phenomenon is observed in two different materials and persists over a wide range of excitation wavelengths, fluences, and temperatures, demonstrating its robustness. Symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling indicate that optically induced torques alone cannot fully explain the observed dynamics. We therefore propose laser-induced formation of transient spin-spiral states as a possible excitation mechanism."

      "summary": "Understanding and controlling the energy level alignment at interfaces between lead halide perovskites and electron transport layers is crucial for optimizing charge extraction by minimizing recombination losses in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. In this work, we investigated the energy level alignment of C60 on in-situ cleaved MAPbI3 single crystals in multiple repeat experiments using photoelectron spectroscopy aiming to resolve inconsistencies reported in earlier studies. Our results show that both materials remain chemically stable upon interface formation, the strong reactions typically seen when metals contact perovskites. By analyzing Pb 4f and C 1s core level positions in detail, we determined that C60 consistently exhibits a downward energy shift toward MAPbI3, which works against efficient charge extraction. The magnitude of this shift, however, is highly sensitive to the surface composition, highlighting that small variations may lead to significant differences in results. At higher C60 coverages of more than 5 monolayers, a constant HOMO-valence band offset of 0.52 eV was obtained. Assuming a 1.86 eV HOMO-LUMO gap, the C60 LUMO is 0.25 eV below the MAPbI3 conduction band, a value favorable for charge extraction. These findings underscore the decisive role of surface chemistry on interfacial energetics, explain performance variability in perovskite devices, and demonstrate the need to control and accurately measure surface properties. Furthermore, the observed energetic alignment can explain why further interface modification by charge blocking layers or surface passivation is needed for optimized device efficiencies."

      "summary": "In this work, we present a systematic DFT investigation of the interaction between B-doped graphene and four selected metals: Mg and Zn, relevant for next-generation metal-ion batteries, and Cu and Pt, important for single-atom catalysis. Three different boron doping concentrations were considered to elucidate how dopant density influences the binding strength, charge transfer, and electronic structure of the resulting systems. In addition, the effects of biaxial strain and surface oxidation were examined to assess their impact on the reactivity and stability of B-doped graphene. The results show that boron doping substantially enhances graphene's affinity toward metal adsorption, though the extent and nature of this effect depend strongly on the metal type and doping level. For some of the metals investigated, the interaction is found to be almost entirely charge-transfer driven, with minimal orbital hybridization. Mechanical strain is found to enable fine-tuning of the metal/substrate interaction, while surface oxidation introduces a more pronounced effect by enabling direct interaction between metal atoms and oxygen functional groups in most cases, thereby significantly altering adsorption geometry and strength. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of boron-doped graphene materials for energy conversion and storage applications."

By combining perturbation theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the phase transition is dominated by the red-detuned component, resulting in a phase diagram completely different from that of a single-component case under blue-detuned condition. The system exhibits spontaneous phase separation between the two components, manifested as alternating stripe patterns in the normal phase and distinct Bragg gratings in the superradiant phase. Furthermore, the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum reveals roton-type mode softening, indicating that the phase transition also corresponds to the superfluid-to-lattice supersolid transition. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between atomic detunings and collective quantum many-body phenomena, offering potential applications in quantum simulation and optical switching technologies."

      "summary": "Fully connected Blume-Emery-Griffiths neural networks performing pattern recognition and associative memory have been heuristically studied in the past (mainly via the replica trick and under the replica symmetric assumption) as generalization of the standard Hopfield reference. In these notes, at first, by relying upon Guerra interpolation, we re-obtain the existing picture rigorously. Next we show that, due to dilution in the patterns, these networks are able to switch from serial recall (where one pattern is retrieved per time) to parallel recall (where several patterns are retrieved at once) and the larger the dilution, the stronger this emerging multi-tasking capability. In particular, we inspect the regimes of mild dilution (where solely a low storage of pattern can be enabled) and extreme dilution (where a medium storage of patterns can be sustained) separately as they give rise to different outcomes: the former displays hierarchical recall (distributing the amplitudes of the retrieved signals with different amplitudes), the latter -instead- performs a equal-strength recall (where a O(1) fraction of all the patterns is simultaneously retrieved with the same amplitude per pattern). Finally, in order to implement graded responses in the neurons, variations on theme obtained by enlarging the possible values of neural activity these neurons may sustain are also discussed generalizing the Ghatak-Sherrington model for inverse freezing in Hebbian terms."

      "summary": "Magnetic proximity effects in Co/hBN/graphene heterostructures are systematically analyzed via first-principles calculations, demonstrating a pronounced localized spatial variation of the induced spin polarization of graphene's Dirac states. The proximity-induced exchange coupling, magnetic moments, and tunneling spin polarization (TSP) are shown to depend sensitively on the atomic registry at the interfaces. We analyze more than twenty distinct stackings, including high- and low-symmetry configurations, and reveal that the spin splittings of graphene's Dirac bands span a wide range from 1 to 100 meV, depending on the local hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$, hBN $p_z$, and graphene $p_z$ orbitals. The strongest proximity effects emerge at geometric resonances, or \"proximity hot spots\", where the three orbital states overlap maximally. The local spin polarization also depends sensitively on energy: Dirac states aligned with resonant Co orbitals experience the most pronounced exchange interaction. At these energies, the pseudospin Hamiltonian description of magnetic proximity effects breaks down. Outside these resonances, the pseudospin picture is restored. Our findings highlight the intrinsically local nature of proximity effects, governed by the spectral resonance and interlayer wavefunction overlap. We further quantify how additional hBN layers, interlayer twist, and multilayer graphene modify the proximity exchange and TSP, offering microscopic insight for designing spintronic van der Waals heterostructures with engineered interfaces and optimized spin transport."

      "summary": "We present a general theoretical approach for the quantitative description of parametric excitation of spin-wave modes in confined micromagnetic systems. This type of problem belongs to a broader class of nonlinear modal dynamics that arise across many areas of physics and engineering. The ferromagnetic sample is driven by parallel pumping with an external applied magnetic field having two tones at different frequencies, which are able to trigger parametric instability of two resonant modes. The two excited spin-wave modes interact in a strongly nonlinear fashion giving rise to quasiperiodicity, hysteresis and non-commutativity of steady-state oscillation regimes. To disentangle such a complex variety of dynamics, we develop a reduced-order model based on magnetization normal modes that is amenable of appropriate analytical treatment, leading to quantitative description of parametric instability thresholds, post-instability steady-state amplitude saturation and complete determination of phase diagrams for steady-state oscillation regimes. We have performed validation of the theory using numerical simulations. The phase diagrams allow to predict and explain all the features of the nonlinear interaction between the parametrically-excited spin-wave modes and can be directly compared with experimental results."

      "summary": "The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of an Ising ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality in critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${\\mu_0H_c} \\simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \\simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a universally divergent Grueneisen ratio near the emergent CEP, $\\Gamma_H \\propto 1/t^{\\beta+\\gamma-1}$, with ${\\beta} + {\\gamma} \\simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of the 3D Ising universality class and $t \\equiv (T - T_c)/T_c$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK achieved from 2 K and 4 T. Our work opens new avenues for studying supercritical physics and efficient cooling in layered-kagome, rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices."

By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$).

      "summary": "Understanding how biological soft matter responds to electromagnetic fields under ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold (40-50 mV), followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton-proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse responses in hydrogen-bonded media."

We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability."

Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from F\\\"{o}rster's spectral overlap expression."

We classify topologically trivial photonic bands using SRSIs, treating them as the fundamental building blocks of 3D photonic band structures. This means that if certain bands cannot be constructed from these building blocks, they are necessarily topological. Furthermore, we distinguish between photonic and electronic band structures by analyzing which SRSI values are allowed in systems with and without polarization singularity. We also explore the impact of the polarization singularity on the behavior of Wilson loops, providing new insights into the topological classification of 3D photonic systems."

      "summary": "Noise and decoherence are ubiquitous in the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to an external environment. In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically."

They further facilitate optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level when coupled to photons propagating in atomic clouds, which form collective atomic excitations called Rydberg polaritons, strongly interacting with each other. Here, we experimentally explore interactions between a Rydberg polariton in an atomic ensemble and a single, adjacent, Rydberg atom. We discover three different regimes of quantum dynamics corresponding to polariton blockade, coherent exchange, and probabilistic hopping, which are defined by their distinct transmission characteristics, with a transition through an exceptional point occurring between blockade and coherent exchange. We investigate the applications of such interactions for fast, non-destructive detection of Rydberg atoms and present proof-of-principle demonstrations for their potential application in nonlinear photonic networks."

      "summary": "High-dimensional design spaces underpin a wide range of physics-based modeling and computational design tasks in science and engineering. These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows."

      "summary": "Pure-breakage population balance equations (PBEs) give the standard deterministic description of fragmentation and comminution. They predict mean particle size distributions, but they do not determine fluctuations, size-size correlations, or universality under coarse-graining. We develop a field-theoretic framework anchored in the PBE kernel inputs (selection rate and daughter distribution) and compatible with the stochastic Doi-Peliti approach. From homogeneous kernels we derive an exact Markov jump generator in log-size for a mass-weighted (tagged-mass) distribution, with a jump law that is a probability density fixed by the daughter distribution. The generator is generically non-self-adjoint, admits a Lindblad embedding, and has a second-quantized extension. The deterministic PBE appears as the one-body sector, while multi-point correlators encode finite-population fluctuations. We also give a binary-fragmentation embedding whose mean-field limit reproduces the PBE but whose higher correlators capture multiplicative cascade noise. For a linear Airy-type kernel, long-wavelength coarse-graining yields an effective Airy operator as a solvable quadratic sector about a stationary profile, producing explicit mode-sum formulas for equal-time connected two-point correlations. Overall, the framework separates what is fixed by kernel data from what requires additional stochastic modeling and links comminution kernels to universality classes."

      "summary": "Skyrmions, topologically stable field configurations, have recently emerged in classical optics as structured light for high-density data applications. Achieving controllable on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions, while being highly desirable for quantum information technologies, remains challenging due to the nanoscale confinement of quantum emitters (QEs). Here we demonstrate a metasurface-integrated quantum emitter (metaQE) platform enabling room-temperature on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions. Near-field coupling between QEs and propitiously designed surface arrays of meta-atoms mediates spin-orbit interaction, transforming nanoscale-localized dipole emission into free-propagating topologically structured photonic modes. By exploiting this approach for structuring quantum emission from different color centers in nanodiamonds, we realize diverse skyrmionic states, including high-order anti-skyrmions and skyrmionium, and thereby demonstrate its universality across QEs. Our work establishes a unified framework for on-chip structured quantum light sources, offering versatile control of high-dimensional topological states, such as skyrmions, and advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies."

      "summary": "A fundamental problem of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes is the tradeoff between connectivity and universality. It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincar\\'e CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits."

In the presence of open boundary conditions, this system is precisely mapped, through a nonunitary gauge transformation, to the Hermitian AAH model with balanced hopping terms. The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function. These findings offer pathways for both static and dynamic manipulation of spatially adjustable in-gap states in quasiperiodic non-Hermitian lattices."

These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\\gtrsim3\\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation"

However, their coherence is limited by charge noise and driving field induced frequency shifts, and the resulting ensemble $1/f$ dephasing. Here we theoretically demonstrate that a bichromatic driving scheme cancels the second order frequency shift from the control field without sacrificing the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) rate, and without additional gate design or microwave engineering. Based on this property, we further demonstrate that bichromatic control creates a wide operating window that reduces sensitivity to quasi-static charge noise and thus enhances single qubit gate fidelity. This method provides a low-power route to a stabler frequency operation in germanium hole spin qubits and is readily transferable to other semiconductor spin qubit platforms."

While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\\text{TY}(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations."

Hence, quantum algorithms designed in the pre-fault-tolerant era cannot neglect the noisy nature of the hardware, and investigating the relationship between quantum hardware performance and the output of quantum algorithms is essential. In this work, we experimentally study how hardware-aware variational quantum circuits on a superconducting quantum processing unit can model distributions relevant to specific use-case applications for Credit Risk Analysis, e.g., standard Gaussian distributions for latent factor loading in the Gaussian Conditional Independence model. We use a transpilation technique tailored to the specific quantum hardware topology, which minimizes gate depth and connectivity violations, and we calibrate the gate rotations of the circuit to achieve an optimized output from quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate the viability of quantum adaptation on a small-scale, proof-of-concept model inspired by financial applications and offer a good starting point for understanding the practical use of NISQ devices."

While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows."

Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 ${\\AA}$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface."

We propose protocols to simultaneously control the internal (related to its pseudospin-1/2) and motional (position-related) states of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a Morse potential. In the presence of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, the state transition of a noninteracting condensate can be implemented by Raman coupling and detuning terms designed by invariant-based inverse engineering. The state transfer may also be driven by tuning the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling field and modulating the magnitude of the effective synthetic magnetic field. The results can be generalized for interacting condensates by changing the time-dependent detuning to compensate for the interaction. We find that a two-level algorithm for the inverse engineering remains numerically accurate even if the entire set of possible states is considered. The proposed approach is robust against the laser-field noise and systematic device-dependent errors."

      "summary": "The FKG inequality is an invaluable tool in monotone spin systems satisfying the FKG lattice condition, which provides positive correlations for all coordinate-wise increasing functions of spins. However, the FKG lattice condition is somewhat brittle and is not preserved when confining a spin system to a particular phase. For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization. In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich. We use this to extend the proof of the central limit theorem for ERGMs within a phase at low temperatures, due to the second author, to the non-forest phase-coexistence regime, answering a question posed by Bianchi, Collet, and Magnanini for the edge-triangle model."

      "summary": "Quantum thermometry aims to measure temperature in nanoscale quantum systems, paralleling classical thermometry. However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout."

      "summary": "Bayesian Optimization with multi-objective acquisition functions such as q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) requires efficient candidate optimization to maximize acquisition function values. Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization."

Motivated by experimental constraints, we analyze the effects of open and periodic boundary conditions in contrast to the idealized case of infinite momentum space. As a bulk probe for topological invariants, we focus on the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) and show that it exhibits a pronounced sensitivity to boundary conditions, which can be traced to the dynamics in momentum space. Under open boundaries, states that would otherwise extend freely become localized at the edges of the finite momentum space, forming quasienergy edge states. While the bulk response measured by the MCD is strongly affected once the evolving wave packet reaches the boundaries, the persistence of these edge states still reflects the bulk-edge correspondence and provides reliable signatures of topological transitions."

      "summary": "We address the problem of inferring the location of a target that releases odor in the presence of turbulence. Input for the inference is provided by many sensors scattered within the odor plume. Drawing inspiration from distributed chemosensation in biology, we ask whether the accuracy of the inference is affected by proprioceptive noise, i.e., noise on the perceived location of the sensors. Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume. These counterintuitive benefits of noise may be leveraged to improve sensory processing in biology and robotics."

      "summary": "Coherence transfer is a multi-disciplinary topic of interest, including chemistry, biology and physics. In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\\,\\mu$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures."

In this work we show that any finite environmental memory universally induces quadratic short time decoherence, in validating the exponential decay law at early times. For an Ornstein Uhlenbeck environment we derive a closed non markovian expression for the coherence dynamics and obtain a de-coherence time that scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. In the singular limit of vanishing bath memory our result reduces exactly to Tegmark's bound. Numerical simulations based on an exact pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling. These findings demonstrate that Tegmark's result applies only in the Markovian limit and does not rule out mesoscopic quantum coherence in structured biological media."

The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band."

      "summary": "Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods reduce the runtime to $O(N d^{2N})$, an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, while exposing substantial parallelism and enabling GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG.jl, which provides a high-performance, GPU-enabled toolbox for computing SRE and mana. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems."

Explicit formulae are given for the critical temperature, the condensate fraction, the internal energy and the isochoric specific heat, which are calculated for three different gaps which abruptly go to zero at a temperature $T_B$, as well as for the damped counterparts with a smoothed drop to zero. In particular, for the undamped BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) gap it is observed that the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature $T_c$ is equal to that of the ideal Bose gas $T_0$, for every $T_B \\leq T_0$; surprisingly, the condensate fraction presents two different filling rates of the ground state, one at $T_c = T_0$ and another with a higher rate at $T_B < T_0$, suggesting something like a {\\it two-step} BEC; also, its specific heat shows a finite jump at $T_c$ and a divergence at $T_B$ with a critical exponent $\\alpha=1/2$, which is inherited from the divergence of the temperature derivative of the BCS gap at $T_B$."

      "summary": "Controlling planar fault shearing mechanisms is key for improving the high-temperature creep performance of gamma prime-strengthened high-temperature superalloys. This work examines how the Ti concentration in L12-strengthened CoNi-based alloys affects planar fault formation during creep. Interrupted compressive creep tests were conducted at 1223 K under air with a constant load stress of 241 MPa. We found, for the first time, that high Ti additions shift the dominant gamma prime shearing mode from antiphase boundaries (APBs) in Ti-free and low-Ti alloys to superlattice extrinsic stacking faults (SESFs). Systematic ab initio calculations show that in high-Ti alloys, the elevated APB energy renders APB-shearing mode unfavorable. Nevertheless, the SESF energy decreases relative to that in low-Ti compositions, and an increased ratio of complex intrinsic stacking fault (CISF) to SESF energy promote the transformation of high-energy CISFs into lower-energy SESFs. Chemical analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy further reveals that, SESFs in high-Ti alloys are enriched in Ti, Mo and W, yet no grid-like ordering is observed. Together with the ab initio calculations, Mo and W additions in high Ti alloys could facilitate the transformation from L12 structure to low-energy D024 structure, indicating Mo and W segregation along SESFs is energetically favourable. Furthermore, the successive SESF thickening facilitates microtwinning in the absence of D024 ordering along SESFs, as an additional big carrier for creep strain. These new findings clarify the role of Ti in controlling planar fault shearing mechanisms, providing new insights for optimizing the creep performance of next-generation CoNi-based superalloys."

In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase.

      "summary": "Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents."

      "summary": "Glasses possess complex energy landscapes and exhibit non-equilibrium aging dynamics. Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems."

In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing."

However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art ab initio methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a series of $XY$$\\text{B}_{6}\\text{C}_{6}$ clathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes, enabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported ($XY$)$^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures. Further calculations based on the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation demonstrate that the $T_\\text{c}$ values for KRb$\\text{B}_{6}\\text{C}_{6}$ and Rb$\\text{B}_{3}\\text{C}_{3}$ among these stabilized compounds are 102 and 115 K at 0 and 15 GPa, respectively, both being higher than $T_\\text{c}$ of 92 K of KPb$\\text{B}_{6}\\text{C}_{6}$ at the anharmonic level. These record-high $T_\\text{c}$ values, surpassing liquid nitrogen temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength and advancing the search for high-$T_\\text{c}$ superconductivity at (near) ambient pressure."

This theory was recently employed for understanding the three families of single layer cuprate superconductors LSCO, BSLCO and NCCO. Adding these two systems accounts for essentially all single layer compounds where data is available for a range of densities and temperatures.

The $Tl2201$ system has two distinct set of band parameters that fit the same Fermi surface, providing new challenges and insights into the ECFL theory."

      "summary": "Optimizing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) hinges on a comprehensive understanding of their nanostructures, yet traditional characterization methods often fall short, delivering incomplete structural snapshots. We introduce elastically filtered 3D Electron Diffraction (3D ED) as a ground-breaking technique bridging full reciprocal- and real-space structural analysis within a single transmission electron microscope (TEM). Using solvent-vapor annealed DRCN5T:PC71BM, 3D ED reproduces key structural parameters from GIWAXS including lattice spacings, coherence lengths, and mosaicity, while uniquely delivering true in-plane access and direct registration with high-resolution imaging, diffraction imaging and nano-spectroscopy on the same sample. A low-dose, distributed tilt strategy plus energy filtering yields high signal-to-background below damage thresholds. Extension to a second archetypal blend (P3HT:PC71BM; annealing evolution) demonstrates generality. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of 3D ED, particularly in analysing beam-sensitive organic thin films. This paves the way for new avenues in advanced correlative structural characterization of OSCs and holds potential for application to a multitude of other nanostructured materials."

      "summary": "Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for a superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear resistivity, the three-band model crosses the resistivity of the single-band model from above, indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. The enhanced conductivity is mainly contributed by a steep increase in the diffusivity of the three-band model at the crossover, suggesting that three-band transport is more coherent than single-band transport at lower temperatures. Below the same crossover temperature in the three-band model, the pair-field susceptibility increases more steeply than at higher temperatures or when compared to the single-band model. This suggests a possible connection between superconductivity and coherent transport, and further implies that coherent transport might be necessary for a model to capture the high-temperature superconductivity observed in hole-doped cuprates."

Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879]."

In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) -- a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems."

Here we employ electron and synchrotron X-ray beams, individually, to investigate the radiation-induced instability of two types of OIHP single crystals (FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3). Under the electron beam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3, and bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the X-ray beam, a new composition without organic components appears in both FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking and composition changes are attributed to the volatilization of organic components. We propose a volume-strain-based mechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation loss. Using nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngs modulus and increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the structural and mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in radiation environments."

While most studies have focused on three-dimensional compounds, the emergence of altermagnetism in few-layer two-dimensional materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that bilayer MnPS$_3$, a prototypical 2D van der Waals magnet, can host stacking-induced altermagnetic phases. Using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis, we show that interlayer spin alignment and lateral displacement act as coupled symmetry control parameters that switch the system between Type II (collinear AFM) and Type III (altermagnetic) phases. Our systematic exploration reveals how specific stacking geometries enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. These results establish stacking engineering as a powerful, purely structural route for designing tunable altermagnetic states in 2D magnets, opening pathways toward symmetry-driven spintronic and magnetoelectronic devices."

Despite the established time dependent, non-Newtonian character of hydrogels, we find that when the surface of the material is free, an immersed buoyant sphere rises with a constant speed. The effects of the motion are observed to be highly localized around the sphere. When the stress exerted on the material is changed by varying the mass of the sphere, its terminal velocity is found to depend exponentially on its buoyancy. Qualitatively distinct behavior is found when a solid lid is placed on the surface of the material. In this case, a seemingly thixotropic, sublinear time-dependent motion is found. It is observed that linear motion of the sphere is accompanied by flow at the surface of the material whereas fluid movement is suppressed when a lid is present. We use these observations to provide a hypothesis which links the exponential stress dependence of the rheology of the material to the effects of the boundary conditions on the kinematics of the intruder."

      "summary": "Quantum phase transitions between topologically ordered and symmetry-broken phases lie beyond Landau theory. A prime example is the conjectured continuous transition from the bosonic $\\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state to a superfluid, proposed to be governed by a QED$_3$--Chern--Simons (CS) critical point whose stability remains uncertain. We study half-filled bosons in the lowest Landau level subject to a lattice potential. Infinite-cylinder DMRG reveals a single continuous Laughlin--to--superfluid transition. Adiabatic flux insertion collapses the many-body gap and exposes massless Dirac quasiparticles, while momentum-resolved correlation lengths show that three lattice-related density modes share the same critical exponent, evidencing an emergent $SO(3)$ symmetry. The joint appearance of Dirac dispersion and symmetry enlargement provides microscopic support for a stable QED$_3$--CS fixed point. Our numerical strategy also offers a blueprint for exploring Landau-forbidden transitions in fractional Chern insulators and composite Fermi liquids realised in moire and cold-atom systems."

By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis."

By solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\\hbar \\mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\\hbar\\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\\hbar\\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction."

Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions."

The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\\tau\\times L\\times L = 660\\times66\\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden."

Particularly, we systematically review, within the Green's functions theoretical framework, the PMM hybridization dynamics under spin-exchange perturbations proposed by some of us in J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 37, 205601 (2025), which demonstrates a characteristic spatial delocalization when subjected to an exchange coupling $J$ mediated by a quantum spin $S$. This spin-exchange induced PMM spillover effect provides a spectroscopic protocol for determining the quantum statistics of $S$ through the emergent multi-level structure in the proximal QD's density of states. Our principal theoretical result establishes that the exchange interaction generates $2S+2$ ($2S+1$) satellite states symmetrically distributed about the zero-bias anomaly, serving as a definitive signature of bosonic (fermionic) spin statistics. As novelty, we demonstrate that multi-terminal environmental coupling induces significant suppression of the spin-exchange spillover mechanism. Under constrained variations of $J$, this effectively localizes the perturbed PMM within its host QD, preventing spatial hybridization with adjacent site. The absence of topological protection in this minimal Kitaev realization is strategically leveraged to: (i) Develop a novel spectroscopic technique for quantum spin characterization through PMM hybridization signatures; (ii) Propose the \"environmentally induced protection\", an engineered dissipative spectral stabilization for PMMs against exchange fluctuations in multi-terminal architectures."

In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution.

RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits."

Novel second-law equalities and bounds for the extractable work are obtained, the latter being both tighter and easier to evaluate than those in the literature based on the whole chain of controller actions. The Markovian framework also allows us to prove that the bound for the extractable work that incorporates the unavailable information is saturated in a wide class of physical systems, for error-free measurements.

We detail calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons."

      "summary": "We present the first computational framework for molecular dynamics simulation of MoS2 doped with 25 elements spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals using Meta's Universal Model for Atoms machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP). Benchmarking against density functional theory calculations demonstrates the accuracy of the MLIP for simulating doped-MoS2 systems and highlights opportunities for improvement. Using the MLIP, we perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in two-dimensional doped material systems."

      "summary": "The recently introduced concept of generalized thermodynamics is explored here in the context of 1d, 2d and 3d data analysis, performed on samples drawn from a 3d X-ray soil sample image. Different threshold levels are used to binarize the 3d sample, wherefrom relative frequencies of binary patterns are found and then used to address finite size scaling behavior of the response functions as a function of the disorder parameter (equivalent of temperature in thermodynamics). It is found that for different threshold levels response functions for increasing sample sizes approach the thermodynamic limit from different directions, with a crossover reminiscent of a transition from open to periodic boundaries of the Ising model, implying existence of a characteristic correlation scale. It is argued here that this characteristic scale corresponds to the \"natural\" properties of the data, where correlations within finite size samples are neither underestimated nor overestimated. In the current context of soil this scale may be related to the so-called Representative elementary volume (REV), while in other situations this characteristic scale should be interpreted in the context of the phenomenon under study."

This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point."

      "summary": "Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 10\\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fr\\\"ohlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates."

      "summary": "Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models."

However, realizing a longitudinal SDE typically requires simultaneous time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$) and inversion ($\\mathcal{P}$) symmetry breaking in the device, raising challenges in applications. In this Letter, we reveal that an off-axis direct-current bias applied to a planar anisotropic superconductor can convert intrinsic anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, generating ultra-tunable SDE without breaking either $\\mathcal{P}$ or $\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Using both Ginzburg-Landau theory and self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that diode efficiency can be continuously tuned via bias current amplitude. Notably, when the injected bias current exceeds a critical threshold, the system is driven into a ``unidirectional superconductivity\" regime, where transverse dissipationless currents are permitted in only one direction. Based on this mechanism, we propose the ``current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST)\" and demonstrate its utility in tunable supercurrent range controllers and half-wave rectifiers. Our findings open new avenues for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics."

      "summary": "Understanding the sodium-storage mechanism in hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for advancing sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology. However, the intrinsic complexity of HC microstructures and their interactions with sodium remain not fully elucidated. We present a multiscale methodology that integrates grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a machine-learning interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework to investigate sodium insertion mechanisms in hard carbons with different levels of porosity, achieved by simulating structural models with densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 g cm$^{-3}$. Structural and thermodynamic analyses reveal the interplay between pore size and accessibility and the relative contributions of adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling to the overall storage capacity. Low-density carbons favor pore-filling, achieving extremely high capacities at near-zero voltages, whereas high-density carbons primarily store sodium through adsorption and intercalation, leading to lower but more stable capacities. Intermediate-density carbons ($1.3-1.6$ g cm$^{-3}$) provide the most balanced performance, combining moderate capacity (480 and 310 mAh g$^{-1}$), safe operating voltages, and minimal volume expansion ($<10$\\%). These findings establish a direct correlation between carbon density and electrochemical behavior, providing atomic-scale insight into how hard carbon morphology governs sodium-storage. The proposed framework offers a rational design principle for optimizing HC-based SIB anodes toward high energy density and long-term cycling stability."

One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue."

The rate at which ground-state domains nucleate follows an Arrhenius law, with an exponential factor determined by a saddle-point of the energy functional -- the critical droplet or instanton -- and a magnitude fixed by small fluctuations about this configuration. We evaluate both contributions over the full parameter space, using a Gel'fand-Yaglom approach to reduce the calculation of the fluctuation spectrum to an initial-value problem. In addition, we obtain a closed-form expression for critical droplets close to the coexistence line, and use it to formulate an effective theory of domain nucleation and growth as a Kramers escape problem for the droplet size. Our results determine the parametric dependence of the nucleation rate and predict its signature in experimental images of a nucleating gas, increasing the rigor of comparisons between nucleation theory and experiment."

For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,\\beta} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $\\beta$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\\cal T}_{GNR}(\\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage."

In particular, the role of cross-interactions between unlike components remains insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically investigate how cross-interaction character controls phase behavior in binary mixtures of hard and soft particles using coarse-grained modeling, Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. Four representative systems are examined that differ only in whether interactions between unlike particles are bounded or hard-sphere. We show that penetrable (bounded) cross-interactions are both necessary and sufficient to induce microphase separation, even in the absence of attractive forces. Such systems exhibit dispersed states, macrophase separation, and microphase-separated morphologies characterized by finite-wavelength compositional ordering. In contrast, purely hard-sphere cross interactions suppress microphase separation entirely, despite strong local clustering. Comparison between theory and simulations reveals qualitative agreement in phase topology, while simulations additionally capture hierarchical and multiscale ordering near crossover regimes. These findings establish cross-interaction softness as a fundamental design principle for controlling phase behavior in multicomponent colloidal and soft-matter systems."

      "summary": "We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries."

      "summary": "Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical methods based on first-principles calculations are fundamentally limited by the need to calculate a large space of input magnetic configurations. Here we introduce a symmetry-aided strategy based on Landau's phase transition theory. By utilizing the crystallographic space group and the Wyckoff positions of magnetic ions, we narrow down the initial magnetic configurations to a limited number of candidates via the analysis of the group representations. The magnetic ground state is subsequently determined by the lowest energy of those well-seleted magnetic configurations via first-principles calculations. Benchmarking calculations were performed on a subset of the MAGNDATA database with wave vector q=0 and fewer than 40 atoms per unit cell, comprising 302 materials. Our method successfully identified the magnetic structures for 212 of these materials. We further apply our highly efficient method to 7,520 stoichiometric transition metal compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,900 magnetic materials. To demonstrate the utility of our database, we apply it to the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, leading to the identification of 1,070 and 392 instances, respectively."

      "summary": "Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. This study investigates ion-exchange kinetics within silicate glasses, operating under the Nernst-Planck binary interdiffusion regime. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance."

In particular, we implement a fully differentiable pipeline to enable batch-wise optimization on both direct and latent crystallographic representations. Using the GPU acceleration, this implementation achieves about fivefold speed compared to our previous CPU workflow, while yielding comparable outcomes. In addition, we introduce the optimization strategy that alternatively performs optimization on the direct and latent crystal representations. This dual-level relaxation approach can effectively escape local minima defined by different objective gradients, thus increasing the success rate of generating complex structures satisfying the target local environments. This framework can be extended to systems consisting of multi-components and multi-environments, providing a scalable route to generate material structures with the target local environment."

      "summary": "Accurate prediction of dielectric tensors is essential for accelerating the discovery of next-generation inorganic dielectric materials. Existing machine learning approaches, such as equivariant graph neural networks, typically rely on specially-designed network architectures to enforce O(3) equivariance. However, to preserve equivariance, these specially-designed models restrict the update of equivariant features during message passing to linear transformations or gated equivariant nonlinearities. The inability to implicitly characterize more complex nonlinear structures may reduce the predictive accuracy of the model. In this study, we introduce a frame-averaging-based approach to achieve equivariant dielectric tensor prediction. We propose GoeCTP, an O(3)-equivariant framework that predicts dielectric tensors without imposing any structural restrictions on the backbone network. We benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art models and further employ it for large-scale virtual screening of thermodynamically stable materials from the Materials Project database. GoeCTP successfully identifies various promising candidates, such as Zr(InBr$_3$)$_2$ (band gap $E_g = 2.41$ eV, dielectric constant $\\overline{\\varepsilon} = 194.72$) and SeI$_2$ (anisotropy ratio $\\alpha_r = 96.763$), demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency in accelerating the discovery of advanced inorganic dielectric materials."

      "summary": "Antiferroelectrics are antipolar materials which possess an electric field-induced phase transition to a polar, ferroelectric phase and offer significant potential for sensing/actuation and energy-storage applications. Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials."

This tail often exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and we show that the singularity is captured by a time-dependent WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation applied directly to the master equation. This approximation, however, leaves undetermined a large pre-exponential factor. Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner\" solution), valid for not too large $m$. We demonstrate and verify this method on three examples of reactions which are also solvable without approximations."

Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear N\\'eel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena."

Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we uncover a phonon-dominated thermal transport regime in the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP. Remarkably, although TaP is metallic, its phonon thermal conductivity ($\\kappa_{\\text{ph}}$) reaches as high as 171 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, surpassing its electronic counterpart by more than a factor of five. This anomalously high $\\kappa_{\\text{ph}}$ is enabled by the unique electronic and phononic band structures, characterized by the Weyl nodes near the Fermi level, together with acoustic phonon bunching and a wide frequency gap in the phonon spectrum, which collectively suppress phonon-electron and phonon-phonon scattering processes. Due to the substantial phonon contribution, the derived Lorenz number deviates strongly from the conventional Wiedemann-Franz law. We further show that the significance of phonon thermal transport is universal across topological semimetals. Our work provides deeper insight into thermal transport mechanisms in topological semimetals and extends the scope for discovering materials with high thermal conductivity."

Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades. The recent rise of large language models has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities. However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking. In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics, we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context-sensitive grammars, which we call the context-sensitive random language model, and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model. We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly zero to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider. Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase. This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but are generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases."

An exact map of their ground state in a harmonic trap in one and two dimensions to the classical Gaussian unitary and complex Ginibre ensemble, respectively, allows to determine the counting statistics at finite and infinite system size. We will establish two new results in this setup. First, we uncover an interpolating central limit theorem between known results in one and two dimensions, for linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble. We find an entire range of interpolating weak non-Hermiticity limits, given by a two-parameter family for the mesoscopic scaling regime. Second, we considerably generalize the proportionality between the number variance and the entanglement entropy between Fermions in a set $A$ and its complement in two dimensions. Previously known only for rotationally invariant sets and external potentials, we prove a holographic principle for general non-rotationally invariant sets and random normal matrices.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used for this purpose; with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (\\SI{3}{\\micro\\meter} gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \\SI{700}{\\celsius} anneal. These results will inform nanofabrication for other superconducting materials and the integration of magnetic materials for hybrid systems."

The measurements cover the spectral range of 0.39-1.07 ${\\mu}$m and temperatures from 1${\\deg}$C to 45${\\deg}$C. The data were modeled using a two-pole Sellmeier equation, with temperature dependence expressed through wavelength-dependent thermal coefficients. Four fitting models (Sellmeier and Cauchy) with different numbers of parameters were tested. For pentaethylene glycol, results from all models are shown; for the remaining glycols, only the two-pole Sellmeier fits are presented in tabular form. Thermal coefficient values for six wavelengths of practical importance are also tabulated. Experimental uncertainties in refractive index, wavelength, and temperature were rigorously evaluated and incorporated into the analysis. The influence of sample purity, including residual water content and manufacturer-reported impurities, was assessed and accounted for in the uncertainty estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to systematically characterize both chromatic dispersion and thermal variation of the refractive index for these glycols over such a broad spectral and temperature range. The validated fitting equations and parameters are suitable for use in optical modeling, materials characterisation, and related applications. All raw data are available in a publicly accessible repository."

The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a non-local Chern-Simons topological term. Thus, we obtain the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics as a most complete gauge invariant model that provides a light mass associated with the Chern-Simons parameter, and also includes a Lee-Wick heavy mass. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the quantum corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is unitary at the tree level."

In the reaction, three ultracold atoms collide to form a diatomic molecule. This product molecule can be produced in various internal states, characterizing the different product channels of the reaction. Our scheme relies on the coupling between two such product channels at an avoided molecular energy level crossing in the presence of an external magnetic field. The degree of coupling can be set by the magnetic field strength and allows for a widely tunable flux control between the two channels. This scheme is quite general and also holds great promise for a large variety of chemical processes with diverse species, since molecular energy level crossings are ubiquitous in molecular systems and are often easily accessible by standard laboratory equipment."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase should be ``kinematical'' singularities. We conjecture that the SMG interactions generate opposite-chirality bound states, which combine with the gapped elementary mirror states to form massive Dirac fermions. The propagator zeros can then be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we formulate a generalized no-go theorem which establishes the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. We also elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models. Finally, we compile a list of open questions which must be addressed in any SMG model in order to determine whether or not it is subject to the generalized no-go theorem."

We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy."

We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems."

We then generalize this finding to a broader class of dynamics, including the transverse collective dephasing (TCD) model, which achieves a time-crystal phase through a closing Liouvillian gap without requiring a dissipative phase transition. We proceed to numerically demonstrate that this maximal global QFI rate is experimentally attainable for both the BTC and TCD models, even at finite system sizes, via continuous homodyne and photodetection. Moving towards practical implementations, we analyze the precision limits under inefficient detection, revealing a critical difference: for BTC dynamics, inefficiencies asymptotically restore a classical scaling, and only a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible. In contrast, for TCD dynamics, a super-classical scaling is still in principle observable, and our numerical simulations confirm its presence, even under inefficient measurement conditions, establishing the TCD model as a highly robust platform for quantum metrology."

Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that these results stem from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production."

One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation localized mostly on specific topological defects in the hydrogen-bond network of water which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts."

In this paper, we introduce version 2.0 of TBPLaS, a package for large-scale simulation based on TBPM. This new version brings significant improvements with many new features. Existing Python/Cython modeling tools have been thoroughly optimized, and a compatible C++ implementation of the modeling tools is now available, offering efficiency enhancement of several orders. The solvers have been rewritten in C++ from scratch, with the efficiency enhanced by several times or even by an order of magnitude. The workflow of utilizing solvers has also been unified into a more comprehensive and consistent manner. New features include spin texture, Berry curvature and Chern number calculation, partial diagonalization for specific eigenvalues and eigenstates, analytical Hamiltonian, and GPU computing support. The documentation and tutorials have also been updated to the new version. In this paper, we discuss the revisions with respect to version 1.3 and demonstrate the new features.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Conformal interfaces gluing a pair of two-dimensional conformal field theories enjoy a large degree of universality in terms of the coefficients of reflection and transmission of energy, that describe the scattering of conformal matter at the interface. In this article, we study these coefficients beyond conformality, by gluing a pair of $T\\bar T$-deformed 2D CFTs across an interface, which requires the condition $c_L \\mu_L = c_R \\mu_R $ to be obeyed. We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \\emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state. We show that the results can also be reproduced using holographic techniques in the bulk dual of these states."

When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations."

Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force."

Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem."

This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions."

      "summary": "The authors present here the emergence of Mpemba-like patterns—the anomalous evolution of effective temperatures—in strongly coupled, dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. The authors demonstrate that, unlike Markovian effects in spin chains, these patterns are dynamically driven and governed by nonequilibrium statistics during rapid thermalization, requiring a strong system-bath coupling threshold. The standard Lindbladian approximation fails to capture these anomalies. These findings hint at similar patterns in thermalization of primordial black holes strongly interacting with the environment.

      "summary": "The precision of a noisy clock embodied in the limit cycle oscillations of a laser-driven optical cavity is studied. By adjusting the optical cavity length, which in turn influences the limit cycle fluctuations, timekeeping precision enhancements at constant laser power are realized, regardless of the clock’s frequency.
