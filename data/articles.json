      "summary": "Quasi-particle interference (QPI) is a powerful tool to characterize the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in unconventional superconductors, by mapping the spatial dependence of elastic tunneling of electrons between the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope and a sample. Here, we consider the influence of inelastic tunneling on quasi-particle interference, exemplarily for the iron-based superconductor LiFeAs. We clearly observe replica features in both experimental QPI maps and the dispersion extracted from QPI, which from comparison with theoretical model calculations can be attributed to inelastic tunneling. Analysis of the QPI dispersion shows that the inelastic mode that gives rise to these replica features exhibits a resonance between 8 and 10 meV. Comparison of the energy scale of the resonance energy estimated from QPI with inelastic neutron scattering indicates that the replica features arise from interaction with spin fluctuations."

      "summary": "Andreev bound states are superpositions of electrons and holes in a metal that form by coherent reflection from a superconductor. When the length of the superconductor is comparable to the superconducting coherence length, Andreev bound states at opposite edges hybridize by quasiparticle tunneling. In a periodic array, these hybridized bound states form a band at energies below the superconducting gap. In this paper, we derive a theoretical framework for the transport properties of these Andreev crystals. We demonstrate that at high interface transparency and constant phase bias between neighboring superconductors, these bands are {\\it directional}: one band consists only of right -- while the other only of left-moving electronic states. This property enables the application of this device as a flux- and bias-voltage tunable filter that permits signal transmission in only one direction."

      "summary": "This work presents electrothermal co-design of vertical \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) to enhance both heat dissipation and high field management in high-power applications. Here, we demonstrate device-level thermal management tailored for two vertical \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications."

      "summary": "Based on the Zwanzig-Caldeira-Legget theory generalized to systems under the influence of a static magnetic field, we obtain equations of motion for the Brownian particle (BP) and oscillators constituting the bath in which the BP is embedded. The equations are of the type of a generalized Langevin equation, which accounts for the frictional memory of the system. The BP is assumed to be charged while the bath particles are neutral. They thus do not directly respond to the external field, but their interaction with the BP leads to changes in the bath state. Using the solution of the equations found, we calculate the average bath angular momentum and show that it persists for long times when the system is assumed to reach equilibrium. This indicates a possible violation of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem for baths consisting of charged particles. However, this must be confirmed by a substantial generalization of the presented model when the bath particles feel the external field, which affects the memory in the dynamics of the system."

The formalism is applied to reformulate the creation and annihilation operators, leading to modified expressions for the fundamental thermodynamic quantities while preserving the underlying Fermi Dirac statistics. We derived modified expressions for the main thermodynamic quantities. In both the non degenerate and degenerate limits, we examined the effects of the Dunkl parameter on the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, and heat capacity. Furthermore, we analyzed how the Dunkl deformation influences the isothermal compressibility, the average velocity of particles, and the Pauli paramagnetism."

      "summary": "The rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels has led to urgent calls for effective carbon capture methods, with direct air capture (DAC) emerging as a promising solution. This study focuses on the structural characterization of commercially available alkaline anion-exchange membrane (AEM) polymers, Fumasep FAA-3 and IRA 900, for use in low-energy, moisture-driven DAC applications. A combination of X-ray diffraction, small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to explore the structural features of these materials. X-ray scattering analysis revealed molecular ordering and large-scale structural organization in both materials, while humidity-induced changes highlighted the impact of moisture on structural properties. AFM surface analysis further indicated the presence of clustering, porosity, and swelling, which were corroborated by FIB-SEM and TEM imaging. These structural insights offer a deeper understanding of the behavior of AEM-DAC materials during CO2 capture and release, emphasizing the role of moisture in these processes. This work lays the foundation for the development of more energy-efficient DAC polymers, paving the way for improved CO2 capture technologies."

The well-known 2D ferromagnets, such as CrI$_3$, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayers, are characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structures. In contrast, ferromagnetic ordering in 2D noncentrosymmetric materials remains an underexplored area. Here we report a Janus ferromagnet, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$ with inversion symmetry breaking, through first-principles calculations. This monolayer can undergo a ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal-semiconductor transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from in-plane to out-of-plane under strain. We find that Te$_3$ atoms play a key role in determining the MAE, where contributions are primarily from $p_z / p_y$ and $p_x / p_y$ orbitals. This study of Janus ferromagnetic materials has provided a promising platform for the research on the control of magnetism by strain or electric field."

      "summary": "We investigated the formation of granular focused jets defined as narrow upward ejections of grains triggered by impulsive forces and shaped by kinematic focusing on a concave free surface. The jets were generated from nonfluidized granular beds, in contrast to existing granular Worthington jets that originate from fluidized layers. To elucidate the jet dynamics, we performed experiments in which a test tube partially filled with dry glass beads was dropped onto a flat rigid floor, systematically varying the granular pile height$L_{\\rm G}$, drop height $H$, and particle size. The resulting jet formation in granular media was driven by the same kinematic focusing mechanism responsible for jetting in liquids. By conducting parallel experiments using low-viscosity silicone oil under identical conditions, we directly compared the granular and liquid jets. At low pile heights, the granular jet velocity quantitatively agreed with the liquid jet velocity. However, at high pile heights, contrasting trends emerged. Specifically, the granular jet velocity decreased with increasing $L_{\\rm G}$, while the liquid jet velocity increased due to cavitation. Discrete element method simulations confirmed that the velocity reduction in granular jets arose from energy dissipation via grain--grain contacts during impact force propagation. These findings highlight common mechanisms and distinctive dissipation behaviors in granular and liquid focused jets."

Through a combination of transport measurements and optical spectroscopy, we investigated the intermetallic compound Mn4Al11, which features an exceptionally low carrier concentration and undergoes a magnetic phase transition near 68 K. Transport measurements reveal anomalies that deviate from typical metallic behavior at low temperatures. Optical spectroscopy indicates a small, nearly frequency-independent optical conductivity in the far-infrared region, with spectral weight decreasing as the temperature drops from 300 K to 50 K. These behaviors suggest a temperaturedependent carrier density and significant scattering of charge carriers. Combining experimental findings with calculated electronic band structures, we propose that Mn4Al11 is a novel half-semimetal candidate exhibiting a ferrimagnetic ground state."

      "summary": "The motion of suspended colloidal particles generates fluid disturbances in the surrounding medium that create interparticle interactions. While such colloidal hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) have been extensively studied in viscous Newtonian media, comprehensive understanding of HIs in viscoelastic fluids is lacking. We develop a framework to quantify HIs in viscoelastic fluids with high spatiotemporal precision by trapping colloids and inducing translation-rotation hydrodynamic coupling. Using solutions of wormlike micelles (WLMs) as a case study, we discover that HIs are strongly time-dependent and depend on the structural memory generated in the viscoelastic fluid, in contrast to \"instantaneous\" HIs in viscous Newtonian fluids. We directly measure time-dependent HIs between a stationary probe and a driven particle during transient start-up, developing on the WLM relaxation timescale. Following the sudden cessation of the driven particle, we observe an intriguing flow reversal in the opposing direction, lasting for a time about ten times larger than the WLM relaxation time. We corroborate our observations with analytical microhydrodynamic theory, direct numerical solutions of a continuum model, and particle-based Stokesian dynamics simulations. We find that the structural recovery of the WLMs from a nonlinear strain can generate anisotropic and heterogeneous stresses that produce flow reversals and hydrodynamic attraction among colloids. Measured heterogeneities indicate a breakdown of standard continuum models for constitutive relations when the size of colloids is comparable to the length scales of the polymeric constituents and their entanglement lengths."

Here, we use a modified double cleavage drilled compression (DCDC) specimen geometry, which facilitates stable crack propagation, to achieve in situ observation of crack tip - dislocation interaction. MgO specimens, furnished with dislocation-rich barriers, were employed to study how dislocations influence crack propagation. Crack progression was clearly observed to decelerate within dislocation-rich regions, slowing to 15% of its velocity as compared to the pristine crystal. Upon exiting these regions, cracks reaccelerated until reaching the next dislocation-rich barrier. Coupled phase field and crystal plasticity modeling replicates the experimental observations and provides mechanistic insight into crack tip - dislocation interactions. The aligned experiment and simulation results underscore the robustness of the technique and its potential to inform the design of more fracture-resistant ceramics via dislocations."

Machine learning interatomic potentials, trained on data from first-principles calculations, offer a powerful alternative by efficiently approximating the complex three-dimensional potential energy surface with near-DFT accuracy. In this work, we develop a general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloys by using a dataset comprising 20400 configurations across representative binary and ternary amorphous alloys systems. The model demonstrates excellent predictive performance on an independent test set, with a mean absolute error of 5.06 meV/atom for energy and 128.51 meV/\\r{A} for forces. Through extensive validation, the model is shown to reliably capture the trends in macroscopic property variations such as density, Young's modulus and glass transition temperature across both the original training systems and the compositionally modified systems derived from them. It can be directly applied to composition-property mapping of amorphous alloys. Furthermore, the developed interatomic potential enables access to the atomic structures of amorphous alloys, allowing for microscopic analysis and interpretation of experimental results, particularly those deviating from empirical trends.This work breaks the long-standing computational bottleneck in amorphous alloys research by developing the first general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloy systems. The resulting framework provides a robust foundation for data-driven design and high-throughput composition screening in a field previously constrained by traditional simulation limitations."

Our results reveal that, unlike in the diluted magnet $LiHo_{x}Y_{1-x}F_4$, where dilution weakens the effect of these interactions, substitution by planar Er ions amplifies it.

While previous studies have attributed polarization switching to full-layer sliding, the symmetry constraints pose fundamental limitations. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls within in-plane polarization break C3 symmetry, enabling polarization switching under out-of-plane electric fields. Local polarization vectors deviate to response to the field, leading to local reconstruction, and ultimately drives the migration of domain walls. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, successfully realized by our experiments. These insights clarify the microscopic switching mechanism in hexagonal interfacial ferroelectrics, providing a basis for future nanoelectronics applications."

      "summary": "The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches, capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity."

We derive the $\\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$ dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the RG flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those obtained in its perturbative counterpart."

This regime crossover has been both theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in diverse multiphase systems relevant to numerous technological applications, including nanoparticle adhesion at interfaces and liquid imbibition under microscale confinement, and it is attributed to the presence of small nanoscale features of physical or chemical nature at liquid-solid interfaces. This article presents a theoretical framework to more accurately predict and control, advancing or delaying, the dynamic-to-kinetic regime crossover, and highlights strategies for harnessing this phenomenon to enhance or suppress different transport processes in confined multiphase systems."

The statistics of the position moments and the low-order position autocorrelation function (PACF) of the SM closely overlap with those of a stochastic process called the L\\'evy-Lorentz gas (LLg), particularly in the normal and strongly superdiffusive anomalous regimes. However, matching low-order statistics alone cannot fully characterize the microscopic dynamics or distinguish underlying process classes. To demonstrate how these dynamics strongly overlap, we focus on the scaling of higher-order PACF, which provides a more detailed characterization. In this paper, we analytically derive the generalized PACF of the SM and explore its scaling forms under different temporal relationships. Specifically, we derive several scalings of the 3-point PACF by analyzing intriguing relations between three times. We compare these scalings with the power-law tails of the numerically estimated 3-point PACF of the LLg. This comparison provides a detailed description of the correlation scalings of the SM, demonstrating that the SM shares key features with the LLg. Our findings establish the SM as a deterministic analog of the LLg, enabling efficient prediction of multi-time position correlations in superdiffusive systems."

      "summary": "Thouless pumping is a paradigmatic example of topologically protected, directed transport in linear systems. Recent extensions to nonlinear pumps often overlook the need to reassess the conventional framework of linear topology. In this work, we study a nonlinear dimer-chain model that exhibits quantized transport of kinks under a periodic modulation of a pumping parameter. Crucially, linear excitations in the system map to a Rice-Mele model and display topological boundary modes localized at these kinks. Using methods from nonlinear dynamics, we show that instabilities in these boundary modes are the driving mechanism behind the observed kink motion. While the transport resembles that of a linear Thouless pump, it cannot be fully captured by conventional topological indices. Instead, the behavior is more akin to a topological ratchet: robust, directional, and reproducible, yet fundamentally nonlinear. Furthermore, by introducing multiple pumping parameters, we demonstrate fine control over multiple kink trajectories, as well as soliton motion, suggesting applications in information transport. Our results unify concepts from linear topology and nonlinear dynamics to establish a framework for quantized transport in nonlinear media."

      "summary": "Ovonic threshold switching is the key process for several applications of chalcogenide alloys including phase change memories and selector elements in cross-points arrays. Very recently, it has been shown that the threshold switching voltage VT depends on the polarity of the applied field. This feature has been already exploited in the realization of the Single Chalcogenide X-point Memory (SXM) in which a single film of a chalcogenide alloy can serve as both a memory and selector unit. In this work, we provide a microscopic understanding of the polarity-dependent VT by leveraging electrical and physical measurements, numerical simulations based on technology computer aided design (TCAD) and electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). We developed a Graded Band Gap (GBG) model in which an inhomogeneous distribution of localized electronic states in the gap is established by the opposite effect of a strong electric field at the cathode and a high density of electrons in the conduction band at the anode. The model is suitable to reproduce several features of the programming window, including its dependence on temperature, thickness and composition of the chalcogenide alloy. The microscopic understanding that we gained on the SXM operation lays the foundation for important improvements in the memory design and in the selection of better performing alloys for applications in enabling memory technologies."

To incorporate this into daily operations, a transfer learning scheme is required that incrementally updates the previously learned parameters. We outline an online image completion method that efficiently adapts to drifting experimental conditions. Our method can be easily integrated into lab settings, where transfer learning can accelerate image analysis."

Yet, modeling these accurately in transition-metal compounds remains challenging, starting from the self-interaction errors affecting localized and partially filled $d$-orbitals in density-functional theory (DFT) with (semi-)local functionals. In this work, we compare three advanced first-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state with ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation theory. Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy differences using the four-state mapping ($\\Delta E$), and the other via the magnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon dispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear spin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly from the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a posteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the Heisenberg model based on $\\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with experimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows larger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and limitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the accuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling and contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and design of magnetic materials."

Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and well-diffusive in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (1M) than in saturated LiPF6-Adpn solutions (0.04M), and ions predominantly solvated by -CN groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the fast-conducting GBs."

Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enable high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges."

Many active systems exhibit circular swimming, ubiquitous in chemical, physical, and biological systems, that biases motion and reduces transport efficiency. We show that stochastic position-orientation resetting can overcome these limitations in two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles by interrupting circular motion, resulting in tunable dynamics. When resets are infrequent compared to chiral rotation, the steady-state mean-squared displacement varies non-monotonically with rotational diffusion. Steady state excess kurtosis and orientation autocorrelation yields spatiotemporal state diagram comprising three states: an activity-dominated chiral state, and two resetting-dominated states with and without chirality; in contrast, the achiral counterpart supports only the resetting-dominated state. Chirality thus enriches the dynamical landscape, enabling tunable transitions between transport modes absent in achiral systems. A simple reset protocol can thus transform chiral active dynamics and offer a practical strategy for optimizing search and transport in circle swimmers."

Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions. Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2H-MoTe$_2$ reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements.

      "summary": "Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and poor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate. The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation. Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2 stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter coupling."

      "summary": "We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance."

The potential reliably reproduces melting points of U-Nb solid solutions and captures lattice parameter expansion of gamma U-6Nb. Notably, it correctly predicts Hugoniot relations and equations of state up to about 90 GPa and resolves the alpha-prime to gamma transition under static high pressure. Combined with atomic simulations, we reveal a twinning-coupled alpha-prime to gamma transition of U-6Nb under high pressures: {112}gamma twins form via nanosecond-scale twinning precursors generated during the transient adiabatic compressions. The static phase transition pressure is predicted to be 54.5 GPa, comparable to 67.2 GPa by first-principles calculations. Besides, our result suggests that U-6Nb single-crystal would experience a nonlinear elastic relaxation before yielding plastically at 3.1 GPa (shear stress: 0.9 GPa). The results in this work help resolve long-standing discrepancies in understanding the abnormal shear stress relaxation mechanisms under high-pressure shock loading."

      "summary": "Recently, the influence of dissipation on a quantum system has attracted much attention, particularly on how the non-Hermitian terms modify the energy spectrum, band topology, and phase transition point. Motivated by the recent investigation of non-Hermitian $s$-wave superfluidity, we study the non-Hermitian chiral $p+ip$ superfluid (SF) with a complex-valued interaction, originating from inelastic scattering between fermions. We reformulate the non-Hermitian mean-field theory for chiral SFs and derive the gap equation in the path integral approach. By numerically solving the gap equation, we obtain the phase diagram of the non-Hermitian $p+ip$ SF, characterized by the reentrant SF transition and dissipation-induced SF phase, as a result of the evolution of the exceptional lines. The method can be extended to higher partial-wave chiral SFs, such as $d+id$ and $f+if$-wave SFs. We further consider such a chiral $p+ip$ SF on a square lattice, to investigate the influence of dissipation on topology. We find that the non-Hermitian skin effect is absent in the specific cylinder geometry, in which the topology associated with the edge modes and Chern number is robust to dissipation. Besides, we find that the energies at the robust point nodes and line nodes are pure real. We further verify the conditions of zero winding number in (quasi-) one-dimensional systems, and prove an associated ``no-go'' theorem, which is hopefully applied to explore the geometry dependent skin effect."

      "summary": "Chiral quantum magnets with spin-states separated by a large energy gap are technologically attractive but difficult to realize. Geometrically frustrated topological states with nanoscale chirality may offer a chemical pathway to such materials. However, room temperature spin misalignment, weakness of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and high energy requirements for lattice distortions set high physicochemical barriers for their realization. Here, we show that layered iron oxyhydroxides (LIOX) address these challenges due to chirality transfer from surface ligands into spin-states of dimerized FeO6 octahedra with zig-zag stacking. The intercalation of chiral amino acids induces angular displacements in the antiferromagnetic spin pairs with a helical coupling of magnetic moments along the screw axis of the zig-zag chains, or helical spin-ladders. Unlike other chiral magnets, the spin states in LIOX are chemically and optically accessible, they display strong optical resonances with helicity-matching photons and enable spin-selective charge transport. The static rather than dynamic polarization of spin ladders in LIOX makes them particularly suitable for catalysis. Room-temperature spin pairing, field-tunability, environmental robustness, and synthetic simplicity make LIOX and its intercalates a uniquely practical family of quantum magnets."

Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role."

The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity shows a nearly linear decrease in the high-temperature range, indicating the spin gapless semiconductor like behavior of the material. This SGS nature is further supported by the temperature-independent carrier concentration and mobility.

When the inversion symmetry is further broken by the antiferromagnetic order, the emerging odd-parity multipole order renders the bands spin-degenerate but asymmetric in the momentum space. For such parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnets, it has been predicted that electronic nematicity is induced by current, allowing unconventional nonlinear transport phenomena. However, their experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we report nonreciprocal angular magnetoresistance in the layered Dirac material SrMnBi$_2$ with parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic order in its Mn-Bi layers. By quantitatively modelling the angular and field dependencies using a phenomenological framework, we reveal that the observed nonreciprocal interlayer resistivity arises from the broken four-fold symmetry of the Dirac valleys in the Bi square net adjacent to the Mn-Bi layer. Furthermore, we demonstrate the alignment of parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic domains via current-field cooling, achieving electric-magnetic control of the $f$-wave polarity in momentum space. The observed switchable nonreciprocal transport associated with current-induced valley symmetry breaking paves the way for novel antiferromagnetic spintronic and valleytronic applications."

BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents, which vanish under circularly polarized light as constrained by the three-fold rotation and $\\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is observed in the Haldane model: one direction exhibits a time-reversal symmetry-allowed response, whereas another manifests a parity-time symmetry-allowed response. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign, whereas shift current shows a sign flip. The vector field of the Hermitian connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase. Furthermore, we calculate the related quantum geometry, including Berry curvature, quantum metric and Hermitian connection, and demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE."

      "summary": "Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding statistics of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in the classification of non-Abelian Berry phases in braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy includes a reflection operation.. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle number conservation and particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction of the SPT phase with the aid of a controlled local defect. In this example, the zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. Based on the tri-junction implementation, we demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. We further propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results."

While their individual high-P/T phase diagrams have been mapped in considerable detail, comparatively little attention has been paid to the mixtures in which the two species can couple through oxygen transfer, charge redistribution, and nonadiabatic dissociation pathways. Here we use comprehensive ab initio adiabatic/nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, essentially a diabatic trajectory stitching approach, that chart the evolution of CO-N2O mixtures from van-der-Waals fluids to extended amorphous network solids over the range 0-160 GPa and 300-1500 K. We emphasize on (i) the sequence of gas to molecular crystal to polymerized amorphous solid reactive transitions that arise from an interplay between thermal and compression effects in metastable C-N-O mixtures, (ii) the role of N2O unimolecular dissociation in lowering the onset pressure for CO polymerization, and (iii) the emergence of nonadiabatic pathways, via thermal unimolecular dissociation of N2O, accompanied by spin-transition in oxygen atoms that can make C-N-O systems deviate from Born-Oppenheimer dynamics. This dominates the chemistry once the mixture enters the regime of bond-breaking temperatures (T>900 K)."

Limited precision of focused ion beam milling for sample preparation often necessitates the use of conductive substrates or artificially thick layers that differ from actual device architectures. These modifications can alter native strain, electrostatic boundary conditions, and ultimately device response. Here, we present a generic and versatile workflow for \\textit{operando} biasing of thin-film capacitors in the (scanning) transmission electron microscope, including sample fabrication and device operation. By introducing a patterned insulating barrier adjacent to the bulk-characterized capacitors, our approach enables sample preparation without altering the original film structure. As a case study, we apply the method to a piezoelectric thin-film capacitor grown on an insulating substrate, and demonstrate that it preserves the boundary-condition-sensitive domain switching at the atomic scale under applied electric fields. Overall, the process can help to establish a foundation for systematic \\textit{operando} studies of complex thin-film systems under representative bulk testing geometries."

Through simulation, we show that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of a small concentration of dopants in an otherwise known crystal structure. By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, we interpret core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy traditionally used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We show that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but that this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors."

Bi2 Bi2Se3 is a topological semimetal composed of a 2D bismuthene sheet and a Bi2Se3 quintuple layer, forming an intrinsic superlattice. This study investigates the electronic structure and edge states of Bi2 Bi2Se3 [001] oriented films under ambient conditions through conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). Point I-V spectroscopy and current imaging are used to characterize the surface and local transport properties of bismuthene and Bi2Se3 terminated layers. Our measurements reveal force dependent shifts in conduction mechanisms in both bismuthene and Bi2Se3, transitioning from direct tunneling (DT) at low forces and low biases, to Fowler Nordheim tunneling (FNT) at low forces and high biases, and eventually to a more ohmic like behavior at the highest forces. Under DT conditions on the bismuthene termination, we observed the Dirac cone in the dI/dV spectroscopy. Edge states are observed along the perimeter of the (001) terraces for both terminations, and are observed to have higher conductivity than the local terrace. Force-dependent imaging revealed an increase in the width of the edge state as force increased, until the conductive edge state appeared to cover the entire terrace. Furthermore, terrace heights display a force dependent distortion from the high tip forces, which indicates that the transition to the ohmic-like contact regime on either termination results from a complex interplay between strain and tip induced effects. All measurements were performed under ambient conditions, which demonstrates the robustness of the topological and edge states to ambient conditions."

However, the activity of TiO2 anatase and rutile phases is still limited. In this study, an oxygen-deficient high-pressure phase of TiO2, columbite, is stabilized by a high-pressure torsion method. The phase is utilized as an active photocatalyst for hydrogen production, and the mechanism of its high activity is examined using density functional theory (DFT). The activity of columbite appears to be experimentally higher than that of the anatase phase. DFT calculations revealed that columbite does not have a narrow electronic bandgap, but its optical bandgap and light absorbance are improved by oxygen vacancies more significantly compared to anatase. Moreover, the water adsorption energy is higher and the surface activation energy for water splitting on the (101) atomic plane of columbite is lower than that for the active planes of anatase. In conclusion, although columbite is not a low-bandgap semiconductor, its large light absorbance and high surface catalytic activity make it a promising candidate for photocatalytic reactions."

For LuO, we theoretically evaluated $U$ energy dependence of the differential transmission and reflectivity spectra to assess the impact of $U$ energy on the optical properties. In addition to the conventional derivative-like contribution, we observed the influence of the Drude tail owing to $U$-induced plasma energy modulation.

Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably, the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics."

      "summary": "During the fabrication of heterogeneous structures inside chips, impurities and defects are inevitably introduced. However, the mechanism by which defects affect interfacial heat transport remains unclear. In this work, a microscale thermal transport model is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo simulations, explicitly accounting for the effects of defects. The effects of defect concentration and location on thermal transport characteristics are investigated for four heterointerfaces: Si/SiC, GaN/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond. Temperature distribution, spectral thermal conductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show that, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects weakens heat transport. Higher defect concentration leads to lower ITC. Furthermore, when defects are in SiC or Diamond, which have broader phonon spectral distributions, their impact on ITC is weaker. For the GaN/SiC interface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a defect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present in GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC. This behavior arises from defect-induced phonon energy redistribution near the interface. The redistribution increases the population of low-frequency phonons, which are more capable of crossing the interface, thus enhancing heat transfer. This study enriches the fundamental understanding of thermal transport across semiconductor heterointerfaces and guides the design and fabrication of high-ITC heterostructures."

This system hosts $\\emph{g}$-wave spin-split bands, controllable second-order topological states, and chirality-locked anomalous transport properties. Its second-order topological phase manifests as alternating spin-up and spin-down hinge modes along the boundaries of hexagonal nanotubes. Remarkably, these spin-polarized hinge states can be switched through lattice chiral inversion. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical effects exhibit reversed signs in left/right-handed enantiomers, substantiating a universal chirality-controlled response across both electronic and optical channels. Our results establish chiral AMs as a promising platform for non-volatile topological spintronics, opening new avenues for manipulating quantum transport via lattice chirality."

Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g., in the field of plasma physics, but a general solution is still missing there. By building on the analogy with the quantum solution, we provide the classical ergotropy extraction driving: it consists of an instantaneous quench followed by an adiabatic return. We illustrate how the solution, which is valid under an ergodic assumption, is instrumental to finding the ergotropy extracting driving in more general cases. We also show that, just like in the quantum case, the classical ergotropy splits into a coherent and an incoherent part. The presented results open new ways for practical energy recovery in the classical regime while suggesting that there is nothing genuinely quantum in the quantum ergotropy problem."

For small integer values of $c$, we observe ergodicity breaking even at moderately low frequencies, signaling long-lived scarred dynamics. By continuously increasing $c$, one can generate non-monotonic transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic dynamics. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an effective Floquet Hamiltonian based approach.

A central contribution is the universal characterization of conditionally independent identically distributed variables-random variables that become independent upon conditioning on latent parameters. This structure arises naturally in systems with stochastic resetting, a mechanism that generates strong long-range correlations while retaining analytical tractability. Using this framework, we derive universal closed-form expressions for several observables across diverse models, including Brownian motion, Levy flights, ballistic particles, and Dyson Brownian motion, under various resetting protocols. In particular, we demonstrate that resetting induces analytically tractable non-equilibrium steady states. Theoretical predictions are supported by numerical comparisons and experimental comparisons in systems such as diffusive particles in switching harmonic traps. Applications to search optimization are also explored, identifying regimes where resetting enhances or impairs first-passage efficiency, and proposing rescaling-based protocols that outperform traditional resetting."

      "summary": "The triple-Q state arises due to the superposition of three symmetry equivalent spin spirals stabilized by higher-order exchange interactions. It has been predicted more than 20 years ago but was only recently discovered in a Mn monolayer on the Re(0001) surface. To date little is known about the thermodynamic properties of this intriguing non-coplanar spin state. Here, we reveal a low-temperature phase transition between the triple-Q and the row-wise antiferromagnetic state in this system via Monte Carlo simulations based on an atomistic spin model parametrized by density functional theory. By modeling the free energy landscape in terms of thermal excitations we derive an analytical expression of the partition function, which allows us to prove that the phase transition is driven by entropy. The predicted phase transition is not unique to Mn/Re(0001) but appears for a wide range of magnetic interaction parameters and is expected to occur also for other multi-Q states."

To this end, we solve variationally and numerically the underlying generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation which includes the effects of quadratic and cubic nonlinearities. We derive the associated generalized uncertainty principle and its corresponding minimal length. The obtained modified uncertainty relation enables us to search for the quantum gravity signatures in both small and large droplets. We place bounds on the parameter using existing experimental data from recent experiment of dilute droplets of potassium. Improved upper bounds on the generalized uncertainty principle parameters are found from our analysis."

Here we implement spin-orbit coupling in DFTB and GFN-xTB within the Amsterdam Modeling Suite, and apply it to 1T$'$/2H WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Edge-projected spectra reveal robust edge states in 1T$'$ ribbons; and these states remain robust against a laterally infinite 2H substrate, which only shifts the Dirac point via long-wavelength corrugation without introducing additional in-gap states. By contrast, terminated 2H edges generate trivial dispersion branches in the same energy window that hybridize only weakly with the topological edge modes. In the bulk, Fermi-level states are 1T$'$-derived; at the small twist angle, lattice-relaxation-induced strain drives miniband reconstruction, whereas at the large twist angle, the layers become electronically decoupled. These findings suggest the conditions -- controlled twist angle and avoidance of terminated 2H edges -- for achieving quantized conductance and unambiguous spectroscopic"

      "summary": "We investigate the consequences of information exchange between a system and a measurement-feedback apparatus that cools the system below the environmental temperature. A quantitative relationship between entropy pumping and information acquired about the system is derived, showing that, independent of the concrete realization of the feedback, the latter exceeds the former by a positive amount of excess information flow. This excess information flow satisfies a trade-off relation with the precision of the feedback force, which places strong constraints on both the information-theoretic cost of feedback cooling and the required magnitude of the feedback force. From these constraints, a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of optical feedback cooling is derived. Finally, the results are demonstrated for feedback cooling by coherent light scattering. We show that measurement precision is the major factor determining the attainable temperature. Precise measurements can also be leveraged to reduce the required feedback force, leading to significantly more energy-efficient cooling close to the fundamental bound for realistic parameter values."

      "summary": "CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC) due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges and hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density (JON) and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct tunneling (DT) and Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric (FE) switching, DT, FN tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high JON and a remarkable on-off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC applications."

      "summary": "Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) provide fundamental constraints on the interplay between power fluctuations, entropy production, and efficiency in overdamped stationary autonomous heat engines. However, their validity in underdamped regimes remains limited and less explored. Here, we analytically and numerically study a physically realizable autonomous heat engine composed of two underdamped continuous degrees of freedom coupled to a two-level system. We show that this nonlinear setup can robustly violate TUR-based trade-offs by exploiting resonant coupling, effectively using one underdamped mode as an internal periodic drive. When this coupling is suppressed, the system recovers TUR-like bounds consistent with overdamped theory. Importantly, we demonstrate that the strongest suppression of current fluctuations occurs in a resonance regime that can be directly inferred from mean current measurements - a quantity typically much easier to access experimentally than fluctuations. Our results reveal new pathways to circumvent classical TUR constraints in underdamped systems and provide practical guidelines for designing efficient, precise microscopic engines and autonomous clocks."

We refer to these systems as odd fluids. While much progress has been made in the continuum theory of odd-viscous fluids, and non-collisional models for odd viscous fluids have been proposed, a classical microscopic description in which the transverse responses originate from collisions is lacking. In this paper, we show that a dilute granular gas of rough and inelastic particles driven by a constant torque is a minimal microscopic model of an odd fluid. By applying the methods of Boltzmann kinetic theory, we obtain a hydrodynamic description of the microscopic model. Then, using the method of adiabatic elimination, we numerically compute all the response coefficients of the model, explicitly showing that the model has many odd response terms. Our theory predicts that certain odd response coefficients can change sign even when the direction of the external torque is fixed. While we choose a particular case, the procedure we present can be applied to any collisional model. We also present a semi-quantitative method to determine the hydrodynamic variables of the theory by observing the eigenvalue spectrum of the linear collision operator."

      "summary": "We investigate the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) in infinite-layer nickelate films with different disorder levels. The disordered NdNiO$_{2}$ film exhibits a flat $S/T$ curve, whereas cleaner samples display a logarithmic divergence with decreasing temperature, followed by a pronounced ``hump'' near 25 K. These distinct behaviors reveal a disorder-driven transition from band-structure-dominated transport to quantum-critical-dominated transport. Below the ``hump'' temperature, four-fold symmetry breaking is observed in the in-plane angular magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic order in parent infinite-layer nickelate films. Furthermore, the logarithmic divergence in $S/T$ is also observed in a clean superconducting Sm$_{0.73}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.22}$NiO$_{2}$ film, where it coexists with linear-in-temperature resistivity over the same temperature range. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum criticality over a wide doping range in clean infinite-layer nickelate films, similar to cuprates, which highlights the central role of antiferromagnetic spin correlations in their superconducting pairing mechanisms."

We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent."

Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature of 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of altermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature dependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable band shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel temperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order. These findings establish Co1/4TaSe2 as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetic phenomena."

In experimental skyrmion lattices, the main factor limiting the quasi-long-range order in thin films has been the non-flat energy landscape - often referred to as pinning effects. We demonstrate direct control of the skyrmion lattice order by effectively tuning the energy landscape employing magnetic field oscillations. By quantifying lattice order and dynamics, we explore how domain boundaries form and evolve due to pinning effects in Kerr microscopy experiments and in Brownian dynamics simulations, offering a pathway to control and study emergent skyrmion lattice properties and 2D phase behavior."

For this experiment, a GeSn layer with Sn content up to 10.5% was grown on a doped Ge(001) substrate. Analysis of the physics of the photoluminescence spectrum collected from the GeSn thin film shows an emission at the expected wavelength of 2300 nm for 10.5% Sn content and the absence of the typically observed defect related signal at 2400 nm. This understanding is further confirmed using short pulse optical excitation of the GeSn grown on undoped Ge substrates."

A key challenge in this field is to engineer a controlled platform where strong confinement, nonlinear interactions, and structural disorder coexist, unlocking access to rich collective behavior and unconventional condensate dynamics. We demonstrate polariton condensation in CsPbBr$_3$ microplatelets that self-assemble into whispering gallery mode microresonators featuring tight lateral photon confinement finely balanced with intrinsic disorder. The system exhibits hallmark signatures of out-of-equilibrium condensation, including a non-linear increase in emission intensity, spectral narrowing, and interaction-induced blueshift. Intrinsic disorder subtly reshapes the cavity energy landscape, inducing condensate fragmentation and enabling direct optical access to the condensate wavefunction. Interferometric measurements reveal extended phase coherence, whereas characteristic fork-shaped fringe dislocations confirm the presence of quantized vortices pinned by the disordered potential. These topological excitations underscore the rich physics driven by the interplay of gain, loss, confinement, and disorder. Our work establishes a scalable platform for investigating driven-dissipative quantum fluids of light at room temperature, where the intrinsic disorder balances optical confinement and provides a window into condensate wavefunction, coherence, and vortex phenomena. This study system opens new opportunities for exploring many-body physics and potentially advancing topological photonics in integrable microcavity architectures."

We develop a linear response theory that treats all types of noise on the same footing and generalizes a concept of transport coefficients for charge and heat currents, as well as relations between them, to equilibrium noise power. Within this theory, we find characteristic scaling of the noise coefficients with temperature in all regimes that can be relevant for experimental realizations of the SYK dots, find a set of universal constants, with their values being unique to the SYK physics, that connect these coefficients, and characterize noise manifestations of the Coulomb blockade.

Using the integrability of the $\\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena."

      "summary": "We experimentally investigate the drag force exerted by a suspension of light-induced active particles (APs) on a translating and beating idealized flagellum-shaped object realized through negative phototactic interactions with the APs. We observe both positive and negative drag forces, depending on the beating frequency and translational velocity, driven by the dynamic redistribution of APs in response to the object's motion. These findings are supported by numerical simulations and an analytical model, extendable to a range of slender geometries. Our results illustrate the complex interplay between geometric body changes and the density distribution in active baths, which may also be relevant for microrobotic applications."

However, in many experimentally relevant situations, such as semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) hybrid nanowires hosting Majorana zero modes, the interplay between strong disorder and finite-size effects renders these indicators (e.g., the so-called topological visibility) biased and ill-defined, significantly limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we propose the topological invariant rigorously defined for an infinite system constructed by periodically repeating the original finite disordered system, as a topological indicator. Using the one-dimensional SM-SC hybrid nanowire as an example, we show that this general and transparent approach yields faithful topological indicators free from the biases affecting commonly used finite-size indicators, capturing the nature (topological or trivial) of the phase at generic points in parameter space, and providing a reliable tool for interpreting experimental results."

      "summary": "Elastic deformations couple with electronic degrees of freedom in materials to generate gauge fields that lead to interesting transport properties. Recently, it has been well studied that strain-induced chiral magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals lead to interesting magnetotransport induced by the chiral anomaly (CA). Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a Weyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present in a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge and thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we resolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first demonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit coupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical Boltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband scattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic field can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect, whose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the angle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral anomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We further reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an external magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Ettingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional Lorentz-force-driven counterpart. In light of recent and forthcoming theoretical and experimental advances in the field of SOC-NCMs, we find our study to be particularly timely and relevant."

When only a magnetic field is present, various ring-exchange interactions arise from electron tunneling along {\\it complex} trajectories, which constitute {\\it complex instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in $B$, each ring-exchange constant acquires an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase equal to the magnetic flux enclosed by the real tunneling trajectory of the $B=0$ problem. This effect is directly relevant to two-dimensional electron systems with a small $g$-factor ($g \\ll 1$). In the presence of a Berry curvature, multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a (complexified) phase space $({\\bf r}, {\\bf k})$. To leading order in $\\Omega$, the exchange constants acquire the Berry phase enclosed by a {\\it purely imaginary} trajectory in a momentum space. Finally, when both $B$ and $\\Omega$ are non-zero, in addition to having the AB and Berry phase factors, the magnitude of the exchange constant can also be renormalized by an effective-mass correction. These effects may be relevant for the WC and its proximate phases recently observed in tetra- and penta-layer rhombohedral graphene."

Among these, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) and metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention in the past and present, respectively. While CIGS reached commercial readiness after decades of refinement, their large-scale deployment was hindered by manufacturing complexity, scale-up challenges, and a lack of coordination between materials, device design, and production systems. Perovskite solar cells, despite setting record efficiencies at an unprecedented pace, now face similar challenges on their path to commercialization: ensuring long-term stability, translating laboratory performance to scalable architectures, and aligning with industrial realities. In this perspective, we revisit the CIGS experience not as a benchmark, but as a blueprint, highlighting how its successes and failures can inform a more deliberate and durable trajectory for perovskite PV. Bridging this historical perspective with the current frontier, we propose that the future of perovskites depends not only on continued innovation, but on learning from past thin-film PV experience to avoid its repetition."

In this study, we perform a stochastic analysis of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the introduction of inhibitory mechanisms, which significantly diversifies the study of the reaction. We apply the Fock space formalism to reformulate the master equation, transforming it into a Schr\\\"odinger-type equation. We investigate reversible inhibitions and analyze the behavior of the averaged number of substances involved, identifying a stiffness behavior in all scenarios. In a specific case of partial inhibition, we observe that the inhibitor can act as an activator that favors product formation. We calculate the first product formation time (FPFT), which characterizes the time statistic of the first product formation. We observe the emergence of an intermediate time scale in addition to the two known time scales typical in first-passage problems. This intermediate time scale is closely aligned with the slow-binding kinetics observed in experimentally observed enzymatic reactions that involve inhibitors. This intermediate time scale is related to the new pathways introduced by the presence of inhibitors. This study offers a new perspective on inhibited enzymatic reactions, and demonstrates the usefulness of the Fock space formalism in the analysis of complex chemical systems."

This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates and material properties."

Optics and photonics are particularly compelling platforms as they offer high speeds and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic systems based on nonlinear optics promise high expressivity with a minimal number of parameters. However, so far, there is no efficient and generic physics-based training method allowing us to extract gradients for the most general class of nonlinear optical systems. In this work, we present Scattering Backpropagation, an efficient method for experimentally measuring approximated gradients for nonlinear optical neural networks. Remarkably, our approach does not require a mathematical model of the physical nonlinearity, and only involves two scattering experiments to extract all gradient approximations. The estimation precision depends on the deviation from reciprocity. We successfully apply our method to well-known benchmarks such as XOR and MNIST. Scattering Backpropagation is widely applicable to existing state-of-the-art, scalable platforms, such as optics, microwave, and also extends to other physical platforms such as electrical circuits."

In contrast, we demonstrate that photon-number parity or quadrature projective measurements can restore a macroscopic cat state in nonequilibrium electrons, even in the thermodynamic limit. These dynamics are captured by an external-field approximation, in which the electronic system evolves into a Rabi-oscillation cat state.

In this work, we reformulate the orbital part of the wavefunction using Givens rotation matrices, enabling an analytical treatment of the variational optimization. By combining the low-rank APG with the direct Givens rotation (DGR) method, we achieved a significant improvement in optimization efficiency. We applied the developed method to small molecular systems and confirmed that it provides high accuracy, while also significantly reducing the computational time compared to conventional methods."

      "summary": "Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics."

Conventionally, mixtures of ammonia hemihydrate AHH (2:1 ammonia-water molar ratio) and H2O ice VII have been regarded as the ultimate solid phase assembly in the system. Here we report evidence for chemical reactions between AHH and ice VII above 750 K and 16 GPa that stabilize water-rich ammonia hydrates, including a novel ultra-water rich hydrate NH3.6H2O (1:6 ratio) coexisting with ammonia dihydrate ADH (1:2 ratio) and excess ice VII. This assembly is stable up to at least 30 GPa and 1600 K and can be quenched to room temperature. Our results demonstrate that water-rich ammonia hydrates are favored in the icy mantle of 1-2 MEarth exoplanets regardless of the ammonia content of the hydrate crystallized during accretion and/or evolution as long as excess H2O ice is available. The buoyancy contrast between water-rich hydrates and ice VII may lead to chemical stratification in exoplanet icy mantles, hence affecting their thermal evolution."

This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we demonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only first-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue crossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic models: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non-equilibrium quantum states."

We adopt the recently proposed ansatz \\cite{kulk} for the single-spinon wave function, where a state with $S=1/2$ is built in a spin chain with $L+1$ sites, adding a site with $S_z=1/2$ to the configurations of the ground-state wave function for the spin chain with length $L$. We extend the original work to the case of the Haldane-Shastry model. We discuss how to prepare the single-spinon ansatz both for the Heisenberg and Haldane-Shastry models in quantum computers, using a linear combination of unitaries. We consider three different strategies to compute the single-spinon energy in a quantum computer and analyze their cost in terms of the number of qubits, gates, and circuits."

      "summary": "Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a stochastic approach for solving the many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation without resorting to one-body approximations. QMC algorithms are readily parallelizable via ensembles of $N_w$ walkers, making them well suited to large-scale high-performance computing. Among the QMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most reliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given Hamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of DMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which discretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework. DMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to stabilize walker weights and populations. At the branching step, walkers must be synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or GPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The conventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance, which grows as $\\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel architectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently addresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved weak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a water-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and load-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by utilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high parallel efficiency ($\\sim$98\\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\\rm w}= 51200$), together with a speedup of $\\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the conventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers."

      "summary": "Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy is a technique to probe the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared wavelengths while detecting the upconverted signal at visible wavelengths. It has recently transitioned from large-area molecular films and colloidal suspensions to nanoscale structures, enabled by dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that confine light and matter in the same deep-subwavelength sensing volume. Here, we implement continuous-wave ultra-broadband SFG and DFG spectroscopy from $860$ to $1670~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ on a variety of dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. The use of a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and the absence of geometric phase-matching requirements speed up and simplify data acquisition. At the same time, simultaneous access to SFG and DFG sidebands permits ratiometric signal analysis, enabling both common-noise rejection and field-normalized characterization of coherent response. The resulting spectra harbour the signatures of coherent interference between the resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the $\\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility, previously only observed under fs- and ps-pulsed excitation. We demonstrate the versatility and reproducibility of our approach across several molecules that yield distinct resonant and nonresonant mid-infrared responses. Together, these features position our platform as a scalable route toward multiplexed, high-resolution mid-IR sensing and a potential basis for coherent single- or few-molecule vibrational detection at the chip level."

      "summary": "In this work, we describe a novel localization phenomena, the so-called topological defect accumulation, occurring in a non-Hermitian chain with an arbitrary number of defect sites. Specifically, it refers to the localization and coalescence of multiple defect eigenstates at a single defect site closest to the localization edge of the bulk non-Hermitian skin modes. This phenomenon is distinct from the conventional topological defect states in Hermitian systems, where the defect states are separately localized at their respective defect sites. The requirement for the onset of topological defect accumulation is the presence of non-reciprocal coupling which renders the chain non-Hermitian, as well as imaginary onsite potentials at the defect nodes. This allows the defect state accumulation and distribution to be modulated by both the defect site distribution and their corresponding onsite potentials paving the way for possible applications. Furthermore, this phenomenon is realizable in various synthetic and experimentally realizable platforms, such as topolectrical and photonic systems."

Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However, near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state manipulation."

Recently, it has been suggested to circumvent the sign problem by carrying out path integral simulations with a fictitious quantum statistics variable $\\xi$, which allows for a smooth interpolation between the bosonic and fermionic limits [\\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This $\\xi$-extrapolation method has subsequently been applied to a variety of systems and has facilitated the analysis of an x-ray scattering measurement taken at the National Ignition Facility with unprecedented accuracy [\\textit{Nature Commun.}~\\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. Yet, it comes at the cost of performing an additional $10-20$ simulations, which, in combination with the required small error bars, can pose a serious practical limitation. Here, we remove this bottleneck by presenting a new re-weighting estimator, which allows the study of the full $\\xi$-dependence from a single path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation. This is demonstrated for various observables of the uniform electron gas and also warm dense beryllium. We expect our work to be useful for future PIMC simulations of Fermi systems, including ultracold atoms, electrons in quantum dots, and warm dense quantum plasmas."

The oxides exhibit impressive efficiency in ammonia production compared to binary oxides, while the efficiency is improved by using a mixed cationic configuration.

      "summary": "Dielectric breakdown of insulators is one of the most common failure modes of electronics in the high-radiation environment of space, but its mechanics remain poorly understood. When electron-irradiated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) undergoes breakdown, the resulting channels exhibit striking periodic structures with characteristic wavelengths ~80 {\\mu}m in the recently identified ivy-mode channels. These previously unobserved modulations offer unique insights into the physics of ultra-fast dielectric breakdown. Through materials characterization and theoretical modeling, we identify the physical instability mechanism responsible for these structures. Raman spectroscopy reveals that carbon deposition correlates with channel width variations, indicating that periodic structure formation occurs during the plasma discharge phase. We evaluated three candidate instability mechanisms: the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, and the z-pinch entropy mode. The first two mechanisms operate on incompatible timescales and require unphysical material parameters to match observations. In contrast, the z-pinch entropy mode operates during the nanosecond discharge phase and produces wavelengths consistent with plasma densities of 0.1-1% of solid density and temperatures of 10-100 eV. Current measurements from isolated discharge channels (~200 A) validate theoretical predictions for the entropy mode. These findings establish that the entropy mode plasma instability during the discharge phase, rather than post discharge thermal or mechanical processes, govern periodic structure formation in breakdown channels. This work provides new insights into the physics of dielectric breakdown and establishes a framework for predicting discharge morphology and characteristics in insulators."

Here we revisit this problem and show that material dissipation alone cannot regularize the singular behavior, in sharp contrast with reciprocal systems where any loss suffices. Instead, the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics."

In this article, we introduce two neural network-enhanced approaches for SBD: sample-based neural diagonalization (SND) and adaptive-basis SND (AB-SND). Both employ autoregressive neural networks to efficiently sample relevant basis configurations, with AB-SND additionally optimizing a parameterized basis transformation so that the ground-state wave function becomes more concentrated. We consider different classes of basis transformations: single-spin and non-overlapping two-spin rotations, which are tractable on classical computers, and also more expressive global unitaries that can be implemented using quantum circuits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques on various quantum Ising models, showing that SND achieves high accuracy for concentrated ground states, while AB-SND consistently outperforms both SND and more conventional SBD methods, allowing entering regimes in which the ground state is not concentrated in the original computational basis."

Time-varying materials exchange energy with the waves passing through them, thus exhibiting entirely new phenomena not possible with static media. Work to date has largely considered the realisation of ultrafast time-varying materials, with much less attention paid to how their interaction depends upon the shape of the incident waves themselves. Here we experimentally demonstrate 'waveform shaping' within ultrafast time-varying media: temporal shaping of incident pulses to optimise specific dynamic material interactions. We create an ultrafast time-varying medium by rapidly modulating a waveguide termination, and measure the spectrally resolved reflection matrix. Analysis of this reflection matrix enables the identification of the incident waveforms that undergo a desired spectral transformation. Using this approach, we first characterise the medium's eigenpulses; temporal modes that reflect from the medium without spectral distortion. Next, we identify the waveforms that are either maximally or minimally reflected, enabling strong broadband absorption arising from the temporal modulation of the medium. Finally, we show how energy can be optimally concentrated into a user-defined set of frequency bands upon reflection. Our work paves the way towards new applications of ultrafast time-varying media, spanning from optics to microwaves and acoustics."

In this brief note, we present an analytical treatment of this problem, beginning with a derivation of the Lamb solution for 2D Stokes flows, which in turn is used to obtain the flow fields around a droplet in a purely extensional flow. Using these flow fields, expressions are obtained for the apparent viscosity, $\\mu^*$, of a dilute emulsion as well as a small deformation theory. We show that $\\mu^* = \\mu( 1 + f(\\lambda) \\phi) + \\mathcal{O}(\\phi^2)$ with $f(\\lambda) = (2\\lambda + 1)/(\\lambda + 1)$ where $\\lambda$ is the ratio of the droplet viscosity to the matrix viscosity and $\\phi$ is the area fraction covered by the suspended phase. Also the steady state value of the Taylor deformation parameter $D_T^\\infty$, in the capillarity-dominated regime, obeys $D_T^\\infty = g(\\lambda)\\,\\text{Ca}$, where Ca is the capillary number and $g(\\lambda) = 1$. This contrasts with the 3D case, where $g(\\lambda)$ depends on $\\lambda$. These results are then validated through direct numerical simulations across a wide range of viscosity ratios ($0.01 < \\lambda < 100$). Our results provide a basic theoretical framework for interpreting 2D droplet simulations and provide clear benchmarks for computational fluid dynamics."

      "summary": "Nanoconfined water plays a key role in nanofluidics, electrochemistry, and catalysis, yet its reactivity remains a matter of debate. Prior studies have reported both enhanced and suppressed water self-dissociation relative to the bulk, but without a consistent explanation. Here, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials trained at first-principles accuracy, we investigate dissociation behavior in water confined within 2D slit pores and nanodroplets, using graphene and hexagonal boron nitride as model materials. We find that reactivity is extremely sensitive to water density, confinement width, geometry, material flexibility, and surface chemistry. Despite this complexity, we show that chemical potential -- together with interfacial interactions -- governs dissociation trends and explains the variability observed in prior studies. This thermodynamic perspective reconciles previous contradictions and reveals how nanoscale environments can drastically shift water reactivity. Our findings provide molecular-level insight and offer a design lever for modulating water chemistry at the nanoscale."

      "summary": "Accurate quantum simulations of catalysis on metal surfaces are critical for advancing energy and materials science. Yet most existing methods fall short: density functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational efficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction energetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in contrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when applied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a quantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of accurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while retaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such as auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at catalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable framework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy for two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference site of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface, where conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving quantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals why DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the critical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION thus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of complex catalytic systems."

      "summary": "Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography."

      "summary": "A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime (intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident. In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time. We finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions for which mean-field is expected to hold."

An impurity can be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are difficult to achieve using previously known methods. As a concrete example, we consider a spin-1 chain whose bulk is described by the SU(3)$_{1}$ CFT and edges are coupled to spin-1/2 impurities. We demonstrate that both the low-energy eigenstates and the extracted Affleck-Ludwig entropy are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions."

This establishes a powerful paradigm for investigating non-equilibrium order formation, yet the fundamental mechanisms of critical-point synchronization remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize a microwave pulse as a seed to induce quantum synchronization at the critical point of Floquet driven Rydberg atoms. In the experiment, the microwave periodic driving on Rydberg states acts as a seeded temporal order in subspace, which triggers synchronization across the entire ensemble. The behavior of the emergent synchronized oscillation is elaborately linked to alterations in the seed, such as the relative phase shift and the frequency difference, which result in phase-dependent seeding and embryonic synchronization. This result opens up new possibilities for studying and harnessing time-dependent quantum many-body phenomena, offering insight into the behavior of complex many-body systems under seeding."

We study localization under this type of disorder in a family of 2D models generalizing recent experiments on photonic systems. Models in this family reside on amorphous analogs of kagom\\'{e} lattices with fixed coordination number, vary by a tunable synthetic field, and remarkabaly, permit exact results. We observe two kinds of localization that emerge in these models: Anderson localization by amorphous disorder, and the existence of compact, macroscopically degenerate localized states as in many crystalline flat bands. The flat-band-like degeneracy innate to kagom\\'{e} lattices survives under amorphousness without on-site disorder. This phenomenon arises from the cooperation between the structure of the compact localized states and the geometry of the amorphous graph. More surprisingly, for particular values of the field, such states emerge in the amorphous system that were not present on the kagom\\'{e} lattice in the same field. Outside the flat band, constrained amorphous graph geometry necessitates the existence of a fully delocalized state, near which we observe evidence of a localization-delocalization transition. Our platform serves as a demonstration of how the qualitative behavior of a disordered system can be tuned at fixed graph topology and lead to localization phenomena unique to amorphous systems that are not observed in their generically disordered counterparts."

The characteristics of our design include that the average grain size is about one tenth as large as the digger, and the area packing density {\\phi} is about 90% of the jamming density {\\phi}c. Unlike conventional autonomous diggers that move by fluidizing the surrounding granular media with a much finer grain size, our digger swiftly bypasses this mobility mechanism as coarse grains with interparticle friction are hard to be fluidized. To cope with high interparticle friction, the digger has a circular shape and singly captures granular particles near the front entrance of the recess formed by the center unit running across its body and then ejects the captured particles backwards. We validate this moving strategy in both experiments using a manual digger and the corresponding numerical simulations, and demonstrate that the moving efficiency can be enhanced by the judgement of the human operator but the effectiveness is not significantly influenced by the shape of granular particles. In addition, localized vibration is needed to degrade friction between interlocked irregular-shaped particles. Our numerical results show that the distribution of both moving distances and time intervals between consecutive ejections follow a power-law Further, we experimentally verify this finding by demonstrating that similar power-laws are observed from an automated digger which regularly randomizes its digging direction. Finding these spatio-temporal power laws indicates that digging within a densely-packed granular environment could be a critical phenomenon."

Although observing this effect is still practically unachievable, its analogue generalizations have been shown to be more readily attainable. This paper demonstrates that a gapped Dirac semiconductor, methylammonium lead-bromide perovskite (MAPbBr$_3$), exhibits analogue dynamical Schwinger effect. Tunneling ionization under deep sub-gap mid-infrared irradiation leads to intense photoluminescence in the visible range, in full agreement with quasi-adiabatic theory. In addition to revealing a gapped extended system suitable for studying the analogue Schwinger effect, this observation holds great potential for non-perturbative field sensing, i.e., sensing electric fields through non-perturbative light-matter interactions. First, this paper illustrates this by measuring the local deviation from the nominally cubic phase of a perovskite single crystal, which can be interpreted in terms of frozen-in fields. Next, it is shown that analogue dynamic Schwinger effect can be used for nonperturbative amplification of non-parametric upconversion process in perovskites driven simultaneously by multiple optical fields. This discovery demonstrates the potential for material response beyond perturbation theory in the Schwinger regime, offering extremely sensitive light detection and amplification across an ultrabroad spectral range not accessible by conventional devices."

Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOM), but assuming instead that the system's dynamics gives rise to a Lieb-Robinson bound (L-R) with a logarithmic lightcone, we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation, starting from a generic product state, of $ \\alpha$-R\\'enyi entropies, with $ \\alpha $ close to one, obtaining a $\\log \\, t$-law, that denotes a slow spread of entanglement. This is in sharp contrast with Anderson localized phases that show no dynamically generated entanglement. To prove this result we apply a general theory recently developed by us in arXiv:2408.00743 that quantitatively relates the L-R bounds of a local Hamiltonian with the dynamical generation of entanglement. Assuming instead the existence of LIOM we provide new independent proofs of the known facts that the L-R bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic light cone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy has for large times a $ \\log \\, t$-shape.

Here, we study a one-dimensional model with nearest-neighbor pairing attraction, i.e. a spinful Kitaev chain, under generic spin-orbit couplings such that the spin-rotation symmetry is fully broken. The most general superconducting order parameter is described by a spatial dependent $\\mathbf{d}_i$-vector. We show that a spin-triplet pair density wave (t-PDW) emerges in the ground state and occupies a large part of the phase diagram. The $\\mathbf{d_i}$-vector of the t-PDW rotates with a pitch $Q_{\\rm pdw}$ along the chain and spans an ellipsoid. The pure t-PDW is fully gapped and realizes a class-DIII topological superconductor, characterized by two Majorana zero modes localized at each end of the chain and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into the exotic pure PDW superconductor and provide a possible explanation for the one-dimensional PDW detected along domain walls in monolayer iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se) and potentially realizable using other quantum structures in unconventional superconductors."

      "summary": "The use of pressure to obtain new materials that can be recovered under ambient conditions is a central problem in high-pressure physics. Despite decades of research, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable examples, such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. An area of significant interest is the transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to extended covalent-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO$_2$ has been extensively studied because of its status as a prototypical simple molecular system with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's physics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at extreme pressures and temperatures, has been recently quenched to ambient pressure, but below room temperature. Here we report ab initio calculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture (CO+O$_2$), rather than the compound CO$_2$, lowers the onset of C-polymerization at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~7 GPa (complete by ~23 GPa). Moreover, it leads to the formation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We predict that this dense phase is an energetic material which can potentially be recovered to ambient pressure and temperature."

Using a rigorous perturbative expansion, we show that the presence of the surrounding medium enhances the repulsion between dressed bosonic impurities (polarons) in the regime of weak interactions. Crucially, this differs from prevailing theories based on Landau quasiparticles, which neglect the possibility of quantum degenerate impurities and predict an exchange-induced attraction. We furthermore show that the polaron-polaron interactions are strongly modified if the medium chemical potential rather than the density is held fixed, such that the medium-induced attraction between thermal impurities becomes twice the expected Landau effective interaction. Our work provides a possible explanation for the differing signs of the polaron-polaron interactions observed in experiments across cold atomic gases and two-dimensional semiconductors, and it has important implications for theories of quasiparticles and quantum mixtures in general."

We demonstrate that, regardless of the connection rules, geometrical loops, constructed by piercing excited plaquettes percolate precisely at the thermal critical point $T_{\\rm c}$, with critical exponents coinciding with those of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. Further, we construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters in a random-cluster representation, showing that they also percolate at $T_{\\rm c}$, enabling access to all thermal critical exponents. Strikingly, the Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameters for both loops and FK clusters reveal a pseudo-first-order transition.

The MoSxOy nanoflakes were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. The sintered nanoflakes are 10-20 nm thick and self-assembled in the \"nanoflower\"-shape aggregates forming powder particles. The chemical composition and structure of the powders were studied by XPS, EDS and Raman spectroscopy, which show that the powders have different chemical composition and structure depending on the preparation conditions. These studies revealed the existence of different forms of MoS2 and its oxides in the powders. These features are impactful on electric transport properties. The current vs voltage (I-V) dependences of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal hysteresis-like behavior; and their loop width depends on the chemical composition and structure. In the samples with the highest content of Mo in the oxide/sulfoxide form the negative differential conductivity has been observed. The I-V curves of all MoSxOy nanoflake samples manifest the three-state resistive switching and the long-lasting transient charge/discharge on switching \"on/off\" the voltage across the sample, which evidences the role of interface charges in their conductivity. To describe theoretically the observed I-V curves, polar and electric-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, the Landau-Cahn-Hilliard approach considering flexo-chemical field has been used. The revealed in experiment and explained theoretically features of resistive switching and charge accumulation look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors."

      "summary": "In the last decades multifaceted manifestations of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation theory have been identified for the many-electron problem. Yet, the investigations have been so far mostly limited to paramagnetic states, where symmetry breaking is not allowed. Here, we extend the analysis to the spontaneously symmetry-broken antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of the repulsive Hubbard model. To this aim, we calculated two-particle quantities using dynamical mean-field theory for the AF-ordered Hubbard model and studied the possible occurrence of divergences of the irreducible vertex functions in the charge and spin sectors. Our calculations pinpoint the divergences in the AF phase diagram, showing that while the onset of AF order mitigates the breakdown of the perturbation expansion, it does not fully prevent it. Moreover, we have been able to link the changes in the dynamical structure of the corresponding generalized susceptibilities to the physical crossover from a weak-coupling (Slater) to a strong-coupling (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet, which takes place as the interaction strength is gradually increased. Finally, we discuss possible physical consequences of the irreducible vertex divergences in triggering phase-separation instabilities within the AF phase and elaborate on the implications of our findings for two-dimensional systems, where the onset of a long-range AF order is prevented by the Mermin-Wagner theorem."

In this work we report a special type of obstruction, known as orbital-mediated atomic obstruction, in monolayers of materials with spatial symmetry described by the space group $P$-$3m1$. By means of a minimal tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we show that this obstructed phase is related to the mismatch of the charge centers coming from the atomic limit with respect to the centers that are obtained from a reciprocal space description. Although we find atomic limits that correspond with occupied atomic sites, orbital-mediated atomic obstruction requires the presence of orbitals that have no support in real space. In order to demonstrate the nontrivial character of the obstruction, we confirm the presence of a filling anomaly for finite geometries that is directly associated with the bulk configuration, and discuss the role of the boundary states and their underlying mechanism. Several material examples are presented to illustrate the ubiquity of these nontrivial responses and, in turn, to discuss the differences related to the particular ground state configuration. In addition, we perform a survey of materials and elaborate a list of candidate systems which will host this obstructed phase in monolayer form."

In this work, we investigate the emergence of multiple TAIs in a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain subject to Fibonacci modulation, which transforms a trivial band structure into a sequence of topologically nontrivial phases. This behavior is characterized by the appearance of zero-energy modes and changes in the $Z_2$ topological quantum number. As the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases increases, a feature that is closely related to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. In contrast to conventional TAI phases with fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases display multifractal properties. This model can be experimentally realized using a Bose-Einstein condensate in a momentum-space lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal features can be explored through quench dynamics."

      "summary": "Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics."

This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\\hat{m}(\\theta,\\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\\hat{m}(\\theta,\\phi)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\\hat{m}(\\theta=90^{\\circ},\\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\\hat{m}(\\theta,\\phi$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model."

We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wavefunction, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement. Our findings provide the first analytic treatment of velocity correlations for Jones-Roberts solitons in quantum fluids of light [M. Baker-Rasooli et al., Physical Review Letters, 134, 233401 (2025)], and establish a foundation for characterizing vortices and solitons in compressible quantum fluids."

We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \\emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \\emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed."

In this study, we explore the thermal Hall effect in MnPS3, an insulating antiferromagnetic material exhibiting a spin-flop transition and significant magnetoelastic coupling, making it a strong candidate for studying the thermal Hall effect originating from spin-lattice coupling. We report an exceptionally large thermal Hall angle down to 4 K and show that it cannot be accounted for by standard calculations based on the intrinsic magnon-polaron Berry curvature. Our findings provide an in-depth analysis of the role of the spin-flop transition in the thermal properties of MnPS3 and call for further theory development on magnon-phonon coupling and scattering to reveal their influence on transverse heat transport."

      "summary": "We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\\{\\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \\approx 3.0\\,\\text{K}$ and $B \\approx 4.0\\,\\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\\cdots$Gd and Ni$\\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy."

In this study, we investigate a one-dimensional system of trapped fermionic atoms using the composite boson formalism, which describes pairs of opposite-spin fermions as cobosons (short for composite bosons). By constructing a superposition ansatz of coboson states, we solve the Schr\\\"odinger equation for two fermion pairs under both attractive and repulsive interactions. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the potential of the coboson formalism for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems, achieving results comparable to standard exact diagonalization techniques."

      "summary": "The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon. An extended version of the CST-SSH model, which supports distinct topological phases characterized by higher winding numbers, has also been studied. We show that a similar critical slowdown of wave packets near the boundary occurs at all topological transition points between any two distinct phases. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results."

Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including 10-bit parameter quantization, 4-bit phase measurement precision, and moderate phase noise that can potentially be beneficial with parameter optimization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations."

      "summary": "Associative polymers (APs) with reversible, specific interactions between ``sticker'' sites exhibit a phase behavior that depends on a delicate balance between distinct contributions controlling the binding. For highly-bonded systems, it is entropy that mostly determines if, on increasing concentration, the network forms progressively or \\textit{via} a first-order transition. With the aim of introducing an experimentally-viable system tailored to test the subtle dependence of the phase behavior on the binding site topology, here we numerically investigate AP polymers made of DNA, where ``sticker'' sites made by short DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T spacers. Due to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate with another identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with a single sticker type, $(AA)_6$, and one with two distinct alternating types, $(AB)_6$. At low temperature, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond, the $(AA)_6$ system remains homogeneous, while the $(AB)_6$ system exhibits phase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions from simpler bead-spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer conformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind this separation arises from the different topological constraints associated with intra- versus inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a controllable, realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the thermodynamics of associative polymer networks depends on the bonding site architecture in a clean and controlled way."

While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state."

Execution of LeanLJ matches the current gold standard NIST benchmarks, while providing even stronger guarantees, given LeanLJ's grounding in formal mathematics.

Twisting adjacent layers introduces moir\\'{e} patterns that strongly influence the material electronic and thermal behavior. In twisted graphene systems, the twist angle critically alters phonon transport, leading to reduced thermal conductivity compared to Bernal-stacked configurations. However, experimental investigations into thermal transport in twisted structures remain limited. Here, we study the local thermal properties of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) using Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). We find an increase in thermal resistance of $0.3 \\pm 0.1 \\times 10^6 KW^{-1}$ compared to untwisted bilayers, attributed to changes in both intrinsic thermal conductivity and the tip-sample interface. These results, supported by analytical modeling, provide new insight into thermal transport mechanisms in twisted 2D systems and offer a pathway toward thermal engineering in twistronic devices."

Extending this paradigm to ferroelectric materials suggests the existence of polarization waves and their fundamental quanta, ferrons. Here, we report the generation and transport of polarization waves, i.e., coherent ferrons, in the van der Waals ferroelectric material NbOI2. Upon excitation by a short laser pulse, the polarization wave emits intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) radiation at the ferroelectric transverse optical phonon frequency, modulates the ferroelectric order parameter, and propagates uniaxially along the polar axis at hypersonic velocities of ~105 m/s. These long-lived, uniaxial, and dipole-carrying polarization waves may find applications in narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and coherent electric control."

      "summary": "EuAl$_4$ exhibits a complex phase diagram, including the development of a charge density wave (CDW) below $T_{CDW} = 145$ K. Below $T_{N}=15.4$ K, a series of antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered phases appear, while non-trivial topological phases, like skyrmion lattices, are stabilized under an applied magnetic field. The symmetries of the variously ordered phases are a major issue concerning the understanding of the stabilization of the ordered phases as well as concerning the interplay between the various types of order. EuAl$_4$ at room temperature has tetragonal symmetry with space group $I4/mmm$. The CDW phase has an incommensurately modulated crystal structure described by the modulation wave vector $\\mathbf{q} \\approx 0.17\\mathbf{c}^{*}$. On the basis of various experiments, including elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering, and second-harmonic generation, it has been proposed that the symmetry of the CDW phase of EuAl$_4$ could be centrosymmetric orthorhombic, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic or non-centrosymmetric tetragonal. Here, we report temperature-dependent, single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments that show that the CDW is a transverse CDW with phason disorder, and with non-centrosymmetric symmetry according to the orthorhombic superspace group $F222(0\\,0\\,\\sigma)00s$.Essential for this finding is the availability of a sufficient number of second-order ($2\\mathbf{q}$) satellite reflections in the x-ray diffraction data set. The broken inversion symmetry implies that skyrmions might form due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, instead of a more exotic mechanism as it is required for centrosymmetric structures."

      "summary": "The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\\'e systems has raised the interesting possibility of realizing phases of itenerant anyons. Anyon dispersion is only possible in the absence of continuous magnetic translation symmetry (CMTS). Motivated by this, we consider anyons on the sphere in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field which breaks the ${\\rm SU}(2)$ rotation symmetry, the analog of CMTS on the sphere, down to a ${\\rm U}(1)$. This allows us to study the energy dispersion of the anyons as a function of $L_z$ angular-momentum, while maintaining the perfect flatness of single-particle dispersion. We parametrize the non-uniform field by a real parameter $R$ which concentrates the field at the north (south) pole for $R>1$ ($R < 1$), and show that, for our choice of field, any $p$-body correlation function evaluated in the space of Laughlin quasiholes can be mapped \\emph{exactly} to a corresponding $p$-body correlation function in uniform field. In the thermodynamic limit, this enables us to analytically compute the interaction-generated spatially varying potential felt by the anyons. Remarkably, such spatially varying potential is sufficient to generate dispersion for the anyons, which we compute exactly, up to an overall scaling constant. The anyon dispersion in our model describes azimuthal motion around the sphere at a constant height, similar to spin precession. Our work therefore serves as a concrete demonstration that interaction alone can generate nonzero anyon dispersion in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field."

The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques."

However, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations in practice, since resolving the singularity of a logarithmic partition function requires extremely high-precision data,especially when distinguishing weakly first-order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite-size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the analytic terms. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many-body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first-order phase transitions, such as in JQ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many-body phase transitions."

      "summary": "Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing."

However, the types of spin-orbital interactions are often limited and challenging to tune. Here, we propose and analyze a new platform for spin-orbital interactions based upon a lattice of Wigner molecules in moir\\'e transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Leveraging the spin-orbital degeneracy of the low-energy Hilbert space of each Wigner molecule, we demonstrate that TMD materials can host a general spin-orbital Hamiltonian that is tunable via the moir\\'e superlattice spacing and dielectric environments. We study the phase diagram for this model, revealing a rich landscape of phases driven by spin-orbital interactions, ranging from ferri-electric valence bond solids to a helical spin liquid. Our work establishes moir\\'e Wigner molecules in TMD materials as a prominent platform for correlated spin-orbital phenomena."

      "summary": "Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic, and thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are already unstable. Chaotic instabilities thus far precede thermalization. In a different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain (confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold. The latter leads to chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale, which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals."

      "summary": "The ferroelectric switching speed has been experimentally obfuscated by the interaction between the measurement circuit and the ferroelectric switching itself. This has prohibited the observation of real material responses at nanosecond timescales and lower. Here, fundamental polarization switching speeds in ferroelectric materials with the perovskite, fluorite, and wurtzite structures are reported. Upon lateral scaling of island capacitors from micron to nanoscales, a clear transition from circuit-limited switching to a material-limited switching regime is observed. In La$_{0.15}$Bi$_{0.85}$FeO$_{3}$ capacitors, switching is as fast as ~150 ps, the fastest switching time reported. For polycrystalline Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2}$ capacitors, a fundamental switching limit of ~210 ps is observed. Switching times for Al$_{0.92}$B$_{0.08}$N are near 20 ns, limited by the coercive and breakdown electric fields. The activation field, instantaneous pseudo-resistivity, and energy-delay are reported in this material-limited regime. Lastly, a criterion for reaching the material-limited regime is provided. This regime enables observation of intrinsic material properties and favorable scaling trends for high-performance computing."

      "summary": "Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems."

By computing the first two moments, $\\langle G_N \\rangle$ and $\\langle G_N^2 \\rangle$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over different disorder distributions, we provide the explicit condition for coincidence/distinction of pinning transitions in annealed and quenched systems. We show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the transition points of annealed and quenched systems are always different, although for finite systems there exists a \"gray zone\" in which this distinction may be hardly noticeable. This result may help reconcile opposing viewpoints on whether quenching is marginally relevant."

The recent concept of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces (BFSs), a theoretical model describing ultranodal states, has attracted considerable interest. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) have revealed an anomalous low-energy spin fluctuations deep in the SC state. The low-energy spin fluctuations are enhanced with decreasing temperature, supporting strong Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions associated with BFSs. Here, we further investigate these correlation effects through $^{77}$Se-NMR measurements of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) under pressures up to 2.0 GPa and temperatures down to ~100 mK. The results demonstrate that the anomalous enhancement is suppressed but persists under pressure, implying that quasiparticle interactions become weak by applying pressure. Furthermore, spin fluctuations in the normal state exhibit different temperature dependence from those deep in the SC state, suggesting that the nesting properties of normal electrons differ from those of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. These findings are consistent with the theoretical model of BFSs with C$_2$ symmetry and strengthen evidence for Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions, providing insights into the unconventional pairing state of this system."

We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems."

      "summary": "Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm 2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the OFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off the transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology."

Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials."

A key strategy to address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\\mathrm{2}$ interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS$_\\mathrm{2}$.

      "summary": "The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics."

      "summary": "Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture."

      "summary": "Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics, quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder, thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices."

The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries. Thus a Josephson junction interface with the left-handed structure on one side of the junction and the right-handed structure on the other should exhibit a diode effect. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of right-handed/left-handed and right-handed/right-handed devices fabricated from single crystals of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. A magnetic-field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in both devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $|I_{c-}|$, and we show evidence for a zero-field diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed device but not the right-handed/right-handed device. A maximum asymmetry of 5\\% is observed in both devices. We provide a few explanations for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in these devices."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons, called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rules in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion\". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFT and categorical symmetry of the TO or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we present a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally)."

These include rapidly decaying singular-value spectra and structured singular-vector overlaps. Here, we develop a theory to analyze how these forms of structure shape high-dimensional collective activity in nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We first introduce the random-mode model, a random-matrix ensemble related to the singular-value decomposition that enables control over the spectrum and right-left mode overlaps. Then, using a novel path-integral calculation, we derive analytic expressions that reveal how connectivity structure affects features of collective dynamics: the dimension of activity, which quantifies the number of high-variance collective-activity fluctuations, and the temporal correlations that characterize the timescales of these fluctuations. We show that connectivity structure can be invisible in single-neuron activities while dramatically shaping collective activity. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of these networks, the dimension of activity depends on just two connectivity parameters -- the variance of the couplings and the effective rank of the coupling matrix, which quantifies the number of dominant rank-one connectivity components. We contrast the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low-dimensional connectivity, making predictions about how z-scoring data affects the dimension of activity. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of structured overlaps between left and right modes in the \\textit{Drosophila} connectome, incorporate them into the theory, and show how they further shape collective dynamics."

For measures with a long-range two-body interaction potential that depends only on the distance between neighboring particles we prove a relation between the interaction potential and particle jump rates that is necessary and sufficient for the measure to be invariant for the process. The normalization of the measure and the stationary current are computed both for finite $L$ and $N$ and in the thermodynamic limit. For a finitely many particles that evolve on $\\mathbb{Z}$ unidirectionally it is proved by reverse duality that a certain family of non-stationary measures with a microscopic shock and antishock evolves into a convex combination of such measures with weights given by random walk transition probabilities. On macroscopic scale this domain random walk is a travelling wave phenomenon tantamount to phase separation with a stable shock and a stable antishock. Various potential applications of this result and open questions are outlined."

In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter."

When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes."

Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek\" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme."

While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate vortex-induced losses and find the resistive component of the sensitivity to trapped flux $S$ to be approximately 2~n$\\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\\text{trap}}\\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The resistive sensitivity $S$ decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the reactive component, $S'$, exhibits a maximum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled within the Coffey-Clem framework in the zero-creep limit, under the assumption that vortex pinning is enhanced by thermally activated processes. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \\to \\infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The mutual information has been extensively applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information to arbitrary order in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single bins. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Large Atomistic Models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomistic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to August 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research. The LAMBench code is open-sourced at https://github.com/deepmodeling/lambench, and an interactive leaderboard is available at https://www.aissquare.com/openlam?tab=Benchmark."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We study the capacity of entanglement in certain integrable scale-invariant theories which exhibit Lifshitz scaling symmetry with a generic dynamical exponent z at the critical point. This measure characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix and is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity. We explore various aspects of capacity of entanglement, such as the corresponding universal terms for the ground state, its z-dependence and also its temporal evolution after a global quantum quench in two dimensions. We carefully examine the existence of a convenient entropic c-function based on this quantity both in bosonic and fermionic theories. While in the relativistic case the corresponding c-function displays a monotonic behavior under the RG flow, this is not the case for the nonrelativistic theories. We also investigate the dynamics of capacity of entanglement after a mass quench and show that it follows the quasiparticle interpretation for the spreading of entanglement. Finally, we discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including the entanglement entropy."

While symmetry provides a powerful framework for predicting whether transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Trapped laser-cooled ions present a pristine and highly controllable few-body system for studying this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trap potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional (3D), unit-cell-like ion clusters. We identify a set of transitions signaled by parity-odd octupole order parameters, and probe their distinct dynamical signatures. Our observations reveal the softening of a collective Higgs-like mode indicating spontaneous symmetry-breaking, hysteresis resulting from a catastrophe where a metastable state vanishes abruptly, and stochastic switching between metastable states of differing symmetries. We also uncover a remarkable coincidence of symmetry-breaking and discontinuous transitions, analogous to a thermodynamic triple point. Our results establish 3D trapped-ion clusters as a versatile platform to engineer complex potential energy landscapes, opening new avenues for studies of reaction kinetics, geometric frustration, and related phenomena in mesoscopic platforms."

We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition."

There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\\\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput."

SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter direct detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space."

This spin- and valley-polarized pairing challenges conventional theory and suggests new superconducting orders. Here, the authors present a microscopic explanation for the emergence of such pairing. They show that the same broken symmetries produce an intrinsic superconducting diode effect with direction-dependent critical current. This nonreciprocity is inherent to the graphene stack, requiring no magnetic field. It offers a new platform for field-free, nonreciprocal superconducting transport. [Phys. Rev.

Here, the authors show that natural variations in the NIN-like protein 4 (OsNLP4) encoding gene are responsible for the divergence and introgression of the indica OsNLP4 allele into elite japonica cultivar can increase NUE and grain yield."
