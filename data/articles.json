      "summary": "Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as attractive optoelectronic materials because of high fluorescence quantum yield, broad color tunability, and excellent color purity. However, the ionic nature of MHPs makes them susceptible to polar solvents, leading to defect-induced nonradiative recombination and photoluminescence (PL) quenching. Here, we present a combined in-synthesis ($\\textit{in situ}$) and post-synthesis ion engineering to suppress nonradiative recombination and integrate multicolor MHP arrays on-chip through a perovskite-compatible photolithography process and $\\textit{in situ}$ vapor-phase anion exchange. CsPbBr$_{3}$@CsPbBr$_{3-x}$TFA$_{x}$ nanoplatelets were grown on-chip via a single-step solution process incorporating trifluoroacetate (TFA$^{-}$) pseudohalides. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that TFA$^{-}$ passivate uncoordinated Pb$^{2+}$ ions on nanoplatelet surface and suppresses the formation of metallic lead (Pb$^{0}$). This decreases the non-radiative recombination centers and yields a PL peak at 520 nm with a linewidth of 14.56$\\% \\pm$ 0.5 nm. The nanoplatelets were patterned via a top-down photolithography process and selectively masked with a PMMA/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ stack to enable vapor-phase anion exchange. The PL peak shifted in the unmasked regions from 520 nm to 413 nm, resulting in distinct green and blue emission arrays. Our method enables the scalable fabrication of highly luminescent, two-color MHP arrays with tailored optical properties, advancing their integration into next-generation optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "We present an asymptotically exact solution of a paradigmatic non-Hermitian model: the disordered interacting fermionic Hatano-Nelson model, or equivalently, the non-Hermitian spin-1/2 XXZ model. We use a renormalization group method suited for disordered systems and show that non-Hermitian couplings are relevant perturbations to the Hermitian model, which ultimately leads to a quantum-to-classical crossover. The ground state of the model consists of a collection of strongly coupled pairs of spins of arbitrary size at random positions which, unlike the Hermitian case, do not form singlets, but a mixture of the singlet and the $M=0$ triplet state. As a result, the magnetic susceptibility in the $x,y$-directions becomes negative and diverges at a finite small temperature. Additionally, in sharp contrast to the $\\ln(L)$ increase observed in disordered Hermitian chains, the entanglement entropy of a partition of size $L$ saturates for large $L$, as the strongly coupled pairs become classical and stop contributing at large length scales."

We demonstrate that the model, whose dispersion consists of a flat bottom surrounded by steep walls of prohibitive kinetic energy, serves as a building block to understand superconductivity in the moir\\'e-free limit. We find that the ground-state chirality has a ``ferromagnetic'' coupling to that of the uniform Berry curvature of the model, and compare the analytically obtained binding energies, excitation spectra and off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) with numerical exact diagonalization results. We show that the analytic structure of this model is that of a restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA), initially developed for quantum scars, and build a variety of other exact (but contrived) models with exact chiral superconductivity based on a method developed in Ref.[1]. However, under short range attraction, we show that the Berry Trashcan is the optimal and only realistic point in the class of GMP-like algebras to host a chiral superconductor state. A toy model in 1D and its related physics is also investigated. Our results reveal that chiral superconductivity is natural under attractive interactions in the Berry trashcan model of rhombohedral graphene in displacement field, although we make no claim about the origin of the attraction."

      "summary": "In very clean solid-state systems, where carrier-carrier interactions dominate over any other scattering mechanisms, the flow of electrons can be described within a hydrodynamic framework. In these cases, analogues of viscous fluid phenomena have been experimentally observed. However, experimental studies of electron hydrodynamics have so far been limited to the low velocity, linear response regime. At velocities approaching the speed of sound, the electronic fluid is expected to exhibit compressible behaviour where nonlinear effects and discontinuities such as shocks and choked flow have long been predicted. This compressible regime remains unexplored in electronic systems, despite its promise of strongly nonlinear flow phenomena. Here, we demonstrate compressible electron flow in bilayer graphene through an electronic de Laval nozzle, a structure that accelerates charge carriers past the electronic speed of sound, until they slow down suddenly in a shock. Discontinuities in transport measurements and local flattening of potential in Kelvin probe measurements are consistent with a viscous electron shock front and the presence of supersonic electron flow, and are not consistent with Ohmic or ballistic flow. Breaking the sound barrier in electron liquids opens the door for novel, intrinsically nonlinear electronic devices beyond the paradigm of incompressible flow."

      "summary": "The fractional quantum Hall effect has recently been shown to exist in heterostructures of van der Waals materials without an externally applied magnetic field, e.g. in twisted bilayers of MoTe$_2$. These fractional Chern insulators break time-reversal symmetry spontaneously through polarization of the electron spins in a quantum spin Hall insulator band structure with flat bands. This prompts the question, which states could be realized if the spins remain unpolarized or polarize partially. Specifically, the possibility of time-reversal symmetric topological order arises. Here, we study this problem for odd integer filling of the bands, specifically focusing on vanishing and half valley polarization. Short of reliable microscopic models for small twist angles around $2.1^\\circ$, we study the idealized situation of two Landau levels with opposite chirality, the two-valley quantum Hall model. Using exact diagonalization, we identify different phases arising in this model by tuning the interaction. In the physically relevant regime, the system initially exhibits phase-separated or valley-polarized states, which eventually transition into paired states by reducing onsite Coulomb repulsion."

      "summary": "Recent studies using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) with spintronic emitters as a source have revealed distinct signatures of the Rashba effect. This effect, which arises from the breaking of inversion symmetry in low-dimensional materials, has been recently investigated in CoFeB/PtSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$/LiNbO$_3$-based heterostructures [S. Massabeau et al., APL Mater. 13, 041102, 2025 ]. The observed phenomena are at the source of the generated THz far-field emission, typically through mechanisms such as spin-to-charge conversion triggered by the absorption of ultrafast optical pulses. In this work, we employ first-principles simulations to quantify the Rashba effect at PtSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$/LiNbO$_3$ interfaces, expanding the traditional understanding of spin transport by incorporating the orbital degree of freedom. Moreover, we quantify the degree of control on the THz emission depending on the polarization direction of LiNbO$_3$. In order to achieve this, we analyze the accumulation of both spin and orbital components using linear response theory, revealing distinct behaviors. These findings are crucial for a deeper understanding of the physical processes governing angular momentum-to-charge conversion and THz emission. Moreover, they may provide broader insights into various experimental outcomes, including those related to spin-orbit torque."

      "summary": "Recently, rutile RuO$_2$ has attracted renewed interest due to expectations of prominent altermagnetic spin-splitting. However, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that in its bulk and thick-film forms, RuO$_2$ does not display any form of magnetic ordering. Despite this, the spin structure of RuO$_2$ remains largely unexplored in the ultra-thin limit, where substrate-imposed epitaxial strain can be substantial. Here, we employ spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by ab-initio calculations, to reveal the electronic structure of 2.7~nm-thick epitaxial RuO$_2$ heterostructures. We observe an unconventional spin texture characterized by the coexistence of mirror-even and mirror-odd momentum-dependent components. A comprehensive symmetry analysis rules out nonmagnetic origins of this spin texture. These findings suggest an emergent non-relativistic spin structure enabled by epitaxial strain in the ultra-thin limit, marking a distinct departure from the behavior of relaxed or bulk RuO$_2$. Our work opens new perspectives for exploring symmetry-breaking mechanisms and spin textures in oxide heterostructures."

      "summary": "We present a detailed numerical study of a protocol for momentum-selective transport of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice, achieving narrow momentum distributions through controlled non-adiabatic dynamics. The protocol consists of non-adiabatic loading into the lattice, coherent acceleration using a symmetric trapezoidal acceleration profile, and non-adiabatic release into free space. Using the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we simulate the full sequence and analyze the role of non-adiabatic excitations on the final momentum distribution. We identify the intra-site breathing dynamics as the dominant mechanism governing spectral purity under fast loading conditions. By tracking the condensate's spatial width during the evolution, we demonstrate a direct correlation with the final momentum spread. A variational model based on a Gaussian ansatz quantitatively reproduces the observed dynamics and provides physical insight into the breathing mechanism. Our results reveal the existence of magic times, i.e. specific loading or acceleration durations synchronized with the breathing oscillation period, where quasi-monochromatic momentum distributions can be achieved even with loading times as short as 100 $\\mu$s, offering a route to coherent transport that is faster than adiabatic protocols. This approach is particularly relevant for quantum sensors operating under stringent timing constraints."

We found superconducting transitions up to 503 mK near an optimal electron density of approximately 3 $\\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This is a meaningful increase from the typical optimal transition near 350 mK in similar 2DEGs on SrTiO$_3$ single crystal substrate surfaces. Systematic tuning of 2DEG electron density revealed a consistent BCS scaling between superconducting critical temperature, coherence length, and electron mean free path. Substantial variation of transition width across the dome was described by a paraconductivity model combining Aslamazov-Larkin and Maki-Thompson contributions."

      "summary": "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of <10%. We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1, 5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to account for coating artifacts"

      "summary": "The advent of two-dimensional moir\\'e systems has revolutionized the exploration of phenomena arising from strong correlations and nontrivial band topology. Recently, a moir\\'e superstructure formed by two coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders with slightly mismatched wavevectors has been realized. These incommensurate CDWs can collectively exhibit commensurability, resulting in the jointly commensurate CDW (JC-CDW). This JC-CDW hosts phenomena including electronic anisotropy and phase-modulated hysteresis, and holds promise for non-volatile optoelectronic memory devices. Realizing such functionality requires understanding how the spatial periodicity, coherence, and amplitude of this order evolve under perturbations. Here, we address these questions using time- and momentum-resolved techniques to probe light-induced dynamics in EuTe$_4$. Our time-resolved diffraction results show that under intense photoexcitation, the JC-CDW wavevector and coherence length remain locked along the CDW direction, indicating preserved moir\\'e periodicity while the moir\\'e potential depth is suppressed. This robustness governs the configuration of the photoexcited JC-CDW and leads to the formation of previously underexplored shear-type topological defects. Furthermore, we developed an approach to simultaneously track the temporal evolution of the amplitude and phase of a CDW by following two diffraction peaks corresponding to one order, with findings verified by time-resolved photoemission and electron diffraction. This methodology enables reconstruction of the momentum- and time-resolved evolution of the JC-CDW and direct visualization of shear-type topological defect formation. These findings not only highlight the unique robustness of JC-CDWs out of equilibrium, but also establish a platform for optical moir\\'e engineering and manipulation of quantum materials through topological defect control."

This mode manifests as a sharp resonance with giant Raman efficiency in the pseudovector-symmetry channel of the Raman spectra. By varying fillings, the CSM transitions from chiral spin exciton to excitonic polaron. The spin-flip nature is directly confirmed by the Zeeman effect. Moreover, the filling dependence compellingly evidences a charge-transfer insulator at filling of one.

The favorable lithium-ion diffusivity and mechanical properties of Li3Fe8B8 make it a promising conductive additive for battery materials. Its itinerant ferromagnetism also offers a platform for exploring correlated-electron magnetism and spin-dependent phenomena."

      "summary": "Controlling Mott insulator states has been a long-standing topic in condensed matter physics. Among various controlling parameters, two-dimensional (2D) confinement in epitaxial heterostructures has been demonstrated to convert the correlated metallic nature of SrVO3 into a Mott insulator by reducing the quantum well thickness. Here, we fabricate double quantum well (DQW) structures of SrVO3 with a magnetic barrier of EuTiO3 to tune the hybridization of wave functions by a magnetic field. A significant positive magnetoconductance is observed for DQWs with barriers thinner than 2 nm, while DQWs with thicker barriers do not show such large positive magnetoconductance, instead behaving as a parallel circuit of two single QWs. The observed positive magnetoconductance is accounted in terms of enhanced hybridization of V 3d orbitals across the EuTiO3 barrier under a magnetic field, where the barrier height is reduced by the Zeeman splitting of Ti 3d bands in forced ferromagnetic ordering of localized 4f electrons on Eu2+sites."

      "summary": "By a simulation study of three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) disordered lattice models in the chiral symplectic class, we show that one-dimensional (1D) weak topology universally induces an intermediate quasi-localized (QL) phase between metal and Anderson-localized phases, in which the localization length of wave functions is divergent only along the spatial direction associated with the weak topological index. Our numerical evaluation of the critical exponents of the metal-to-QL transition and the Anderson transition (in the absence of the weak topology) demonstrates that they belong to different universality classes. We also confirm that the critical exponents of these two transitions in the chiral symplectic class significantly differ from those in the chiral unitary and chiral orthogonal classes, highlighting the impact of Kramers time-reversal symmetry on quantum critical behavior."

This work investigates the stability of topological edge states in the presence of a moving impurity. By modeling the impurity as a moving Gaussian on-site potential at the boundary of a two-dimensional (2D) lattice, we show that a moving impurity may cause significant modifications to edge transport, a feature markedly different from the expected robustness of edge transport against a static impurity. We further identify an interesting mechanism to explain the bulk-edge coupling using a co-moving frame, where the density of the bulk states and the degeneracy between the edge states and the bulk become key elements. The physical insights developed in this work are validated across multiple systems, including Chern insulators, quantum spin Hall insulators, and Floquet Chern insulators. Results presented in this work are complementary to our current understanding of the robustness of topological edge transport."

We further characterise the nonlinear evolution of these instabilities, deriving exact and approximate solutions for the spreading and mutual attraction of puller clusters, as well as the wavelength coarsening of the helical instability. Our theoretical predictions closely match the experimentally observed wavelengths, timescales, and flow fields in suspensions of photophobic algae, as well as results from direct numerical simulations. These findings reveal the intrinsic instability mechanisms of aligned active suspensions and demonstrate that coherent structures can be destabilised by the flows they generate."

      "summary": "Colloidal microgel particles such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) undergo a reversible volume phase transition at a volume phase transition temperature, VPTT, in aqueous media. Although the particles shrink in size as the temperature is raised beyond the VPTT, Romeo et al. [Adv. Mater. 2010, 22, 3441-3445] had previously shown that dense aqueous PNIPAM suspensions transform from one viscoelastic solid-like phase to another, with an intermediate viscoelastic liquid-like phase near the VPTT, due to a change in the inter-particle interaction from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Here, we show using a combination of experimental techniques that particle hydrophobicity can be significant even below the VPTT and can result in the emergence of attractive gel-like phases. We achieve this by incorporating polar salts such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, or non-polar additives such as sucrose, to the aqueous medium. Above the VPTT, we observe that suspension rigidity is the highest in the presence of polar salts because of the combined effects of ionic and hydrophobic attractions. In the presence of non-dissociating sucrose, in contrast, the inter-microgel interaction remains hydrophobic across the VPTT. Such easy tunability of interactions by incorporating commonly available chemicals into the suspension medium opens up new avenues for the synthesis of novel metamaterials."

Their history-dependent and nonlinear microstructural recoveries have been studied within the Kovacs framework. Here, we applied the temperature ramps of varying magnitudes to dense colloidal suspensions of thermoresponsive, deformable and compressible microgel particles should serve as an effective strategy to probe the nonlinear path-dependent structural recovery of these systems. We synthesised Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles using the free radical precipitation polymerisation method. Using oscillatory rheology, we studied the relaxations of the viscoelastic moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions that were heated and cooled at various temperature ramp rates. Path-dependent structural recovery was quantified by studying the asymmetric approach of the suspension elastic modulus toward the final temperature during the heating and cooling temperature ramps. The loss modulus peaks, observed at the times of initiation and termination of the temperature ramps, were understood to arise from energy dissipation due to microgel rearrangement events and found to be inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the elastic response. Our work highlights the important role of energy dissipation through microgel rearrangements in eliminating path-dependent asymmetries in the storage moduli of dense PNIPAM glasses subjected to thermal shocks. By tuning the applied temperature ramp rate and particle packing density, therefore, asymmetric storage modulus relaxations in dense systems can be modulated via adjustments of the accessible free volume."

This paper focuses on the analytical wave functions of topological edge states in the SSH model, systematically sorting out the fundamentals of model construction. Based on the tight-binding approximation, it derives the matrix form of the SSH model Hamiltonian and the band structureand clarifies the role of chiral symmetry in the classification of topological phases. By solving the Schrodinger equation of the finite-length lattice, the mathematical expression of the analytical wave function of topological edge states is fully derived, verifying its localized feature of exponential decay. Moreover, it quantitatively analyzes the influence laws of lattice parameters (hopping integrals, lattice constants), electron-electron interactions, and external field perturbations on the wave function amplitude, decay coefficient, and energy. Furthermore, it establishes the quantitative correlation between the analytical wave function and electronic transport (conductivity) as well as optical properties (light absorption coefficient), and discusses its application prospects in the design of topological qubits and the development of new topological materials. The research results provide theoretical support for an in-depth understanding of the physical essence of low-dimensional topological states and lay a foundation for the performance optimization of topology-related devices."

      "summary": "Classical nucleation theory predicts size-dependent nucleation and melting due to surface and confinement effects at the nanoscale. In correlated electronic states, observation of size-dependent nucleation and melting is rarely reported, likely due to the extremely small length scales necessary to observe such effects for electronic states. Here, using 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes as a prototypical two-dimensional (2D) charge density wave (CDW) system, we perform in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperature down to 20 K and observe size-dependent nucleation and melting of CDWs. Specifically, we observe a melting point depression of CDW for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes less than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, we estimate a zero-temperature correlation length of 10--50 nm, which matches the reported CDW domain size for 1T-TiSe$_2$. As the flake size approaches the correlation length, the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the transition is cut off by the finite flake size, limiting long-range order and thereby lowering the transition temperature. For very small flakes whose size is close to the correlation length, we also observe absence of CDWs, as predicted by the model. We thus show that an electronic phase transition follows classical nucleation theory."

      "summary": "High-density polyethylene (HDPE) thin films, while inherently ductile, exhibit poor flaw tolerance. Our experiments show that they fail prematurely not at the point of maximum stretch, but at the boundary of a necked region or notch-tip plastic zone. This study investigates this counter-intuitive failure mechanism and demonstrates how an elastomeric interlayer can mitigate it to enhance toughness. Through a combined experimental (uniaxial, center-notched, pure shear tests) and computational approach, we analyze freestanding HDPE and HDPE-SEPS-HDPE trilayer laminates. Finite element simulations reveal that failure in free-standing HDPE is not governed by a maximum stretch criterion. Instead, it is driven by ductile damage, modeled using a damage parameter that depends on stress-triaxiality and plastic strain. This damage localizes initially at the notch or neck center, but migrates into a \"hotspot\" at the neck/plastic zone boundary, matching the observed crack initiation site. The addition of a soft SEPS interlayer fundamentally alters this behavior by suppressing the ductile damage, causing the failure mechanism to switch from being damage-driven at the neck/plastic zone boundary to being stretch-driven at the notch tip. This switch enhances flaw tolerance and stretchability by relocating and delaying fracture initiation in both defect-free and notched geometries. This work exposes the failure mechanism in HDPE thin films and provides a mechanistically-grounded framework for toughening ductile polymers by manipulating the competition between damage and stretch localization."

The sensor comprises a free layer with a vortex configuration and a perpendicularly magnetized reference layer, which provides a reproducible and linear response when excited by a perpendicular magnetic field. Experimental measurements and micromagnetic simulations were combined to systematically assess the influence of structural parameters, specifically aspect ratio and defect landscape, on key sensor performance metrics, including dynamic range, sensitivity, and detectivity. The out-of-plane vortex sensor demonstrates a significantly improved dynamic range exceeding 200 mT, compared to the 40-80 mT typical of conventional in-plane vortex sensors. Frequency-dependent noise measurements reveal that the sensor exhibits low intrinsic noise, along with improved detectivity and resolution. This performance is ascribed to the field-dependent expansion and contraction of the vortex core, which reduces Barkhausen-type noise caused by defect-induced pinning potentials. Moreover, the sub-100\\,nm lateral dimensions of the sensor enable scalable array integration, providing further enhancements in noise and detectivity through collective averaging. These results underscore the potential of this sensor architecture for advanced magnetic field sensing applications requiring a wide dynamic range and high measurement accuracy at the same time."

Materials genome projects mine these datasets for candidates with breakthrough properties, but existing databases remain limited to compounds with relatively small unit cells due to computational cost. Exascale computers now provide the power to simulate larger and more chemically realistic systems, but fully realizing this potential requires DFT codes that can efficiently scale to thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) DFT code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which form large, anisotropic supercells. Our results link strain and twist angle to material informatics properties, including stability and band gap, and show that pyRMG can initialize and converge challenging RMG-based workflows with limited user intervention."

We show that the method is approximately equivalent to replace the hard core of the original potential by a smooth harmonic function. We then compare the results of simulations using the modified potential and the original one. Results show that this simple modification of the potential, namely replacing the short range wall with a smooth quadratic law, leads to a shift in the time step resulting in the same dynamics than the original potential function but with a much larger time step."

The transition appears at constant temperature, being only induced by the motion of a small percentage of active molecules and the system cooperativity. We observe that cooperative motions strongly increase at the transition and do not disappear when the medium viscosity drops. An increase of temperature is needed to make the cooperative motions disappear, suggesting a connection to the kinetic energy to potential energy ratio instead of the medium viscosity."

      "summary": "We investigate the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of a bilayer system made of $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$, where $X=d,g,i$ corresponds to altermagnets. A universal analytic formula is derived for the TMR ratio. It is proportional to $\\left\\vert J\\right\\vert /\\left( N_{X}\\Gamma \\right) $ for small $\\Gamma $, where $N_{X}$ is the number of the nodes of the $X$% -wave magnet, $J$ is the strength of the $X$-wave magnet, and $\\Gamma $ is the self-energy. It is contrasted with the TMR ratio made of ferromagnets, where it is proportional to $J^{2}/\\Gamma ^{2}$ for small $\\Gamma $. Therefore, the TMR ratio is larger in ferromagnets for $\\left\\vert J\\right\\vert >\\Gamma $. However, the $X$-wave magnets are expected to achieve high-speed and ultra-dense memory owing to the zero net magnetization."

Three kinds of boundary conditions (BCs) are considered: fixed up--up or down--down (the spins at both ends are aligned in the same direction), fixed up--down or down--up (the spins at the two ends are aligned in opposite directions), and fixed--free (the spin at one end is aligned, and the other end is free). It is shown that i) the entanglement entropy of an $XY$ chain with a fixed--free BC is the sum of those of QICs with a fixed--free BC and with a free--free BC; ii) the entanglement entropy of an $XY$ chain with a fixed up--up boundary condition is the sum of those of QICs with a fixed up--up BC and with a free--free BC; and iii) the entanglement entropy of an $XY$ chain with a fixed up--down BC is the sum of that of a QIC with a fixed up--up BC and that of the first excited state of a QIC with a free--free BC."

Among other multicarbon products, it is typically a low-yieleded product due to competing reaction pathways and inefficient C-C coupling. Herein, we report a chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst that achieves a remarkable acetic acid yield of 962 umolg-1h-1 with a high selectivity of 97.3%. The yield is ten times higher than the current highest reported value, while attaining state-of-the-art selectivity. The remarkable The remarkable productivity arises from synergistic cooperation between chiral structure and sulfur (S) sites of CMZI. Chirality-induced spin polarization in CMZI stabilizes the key triplet OCCO intermediate, significantly promoting C-C coupling efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S sites on (102) crystal facets of ZnIn2S4 exhibit thermodynamic and kinetic preferences for acetic acid formation. This work offers critical insights into catalytic strategies for CO2 reduction that could enable the synthesis and scalable production of various multicarbon products."

We find that only when we take into account the ``N\\'{e}el coupling'', i.e., interfacial exchange coupling between the N\\'{e}el order parameter of YIG and spin accumulation of Pt, the convex downward temperature dependence is explained.

By integrating this mechanism into the Shockley model, we predict a near 100 enhancement in magnetoresistance sensitivity under small forward bias, where exponen tial modulation of recombination lifetimes by magnetic fields amplifies resistance changes. Angular momentum conservation enables magnetically tunable circularly polarized luminescence: exclusive conduction-band or valence-band splitting in both neutral regions achieves near-half po larization, while global splitting degrades emission coherence. Furthermore, we propose a \"spin Zener filter\" exploiting 1eV valence band splitting in (Ga, Mn)As, where spin-dependent barrier heights generate near 100% spin-polarized tunneling currents within a voltage-selective win dow. These results establish spin PN junctions as a universal design paradigm for magnetically amplified electronics, polarization-programmable optoelectronics, and voltage-gated spin injection without ferromagnetic contacts."

      "summary": "Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches."

RF reflectometry reveals gate-dependent modulations of the resonance frequency, arising from quantum capacitance oscillations induced by changes in the density of states and FP interference. These oscillations exhibit a quasi-periodic structure that closely correlates with the FP patterns in DC transport measurements. In another device of a Cd3As2 nanowire Josephson junction (L ~ 730 nm, superconducting Al contacts), FP interference patterns are too weak to be resolved in DC conductance but are detectable using RF reflectometry. These results demonstrate the high quality of our Cd3As2 nanowires and the versatility of RF reflectometry, establishing their potential for applications in topological quantum devices, such as Andreev qubits or gatemon architectures."

      "summary": "Thermoelectric materials offer a promising route for efficient heat-to-power conversion. In search of materials functional at high and low operating temperatures, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional lead halide Janus layers (JLs) using density functional theory. The electronegativity difference between halides in JLs significantly modulates the electronic structure, particularly the strong Pb-F bonding in PbIF JLs leads to pronounced band curvature and a unique direct bandgap. Estimated through three-phonon interactions, the lattice thermal conductivity is intrinsically low, primarily due to acoustic phonon contributions and suppressed optical phonon transport. The thermoelectric coefficients are enhanced with carrier doping, resulting in figures of merit as high as 8.94 at room temperature and upto 36.31 at elevated temperatures. These findings establish two-dimensional lead halide Janus layers as exceptional candidates for thermoelectric conversion, and the insights into their elemental and electronic characteristics offer a valuable basis for the future design of high-performance lead-based thermoelectric materials."

      "summary": "Nonreciprocity of light emission, when the radiation intensity differs for two opposite propagation directions, is a rare phenomenon in solids because it requires a violation of the crystal symmetry with respect to time-reversal. Such violation via time-reversal symmetry breaking can occur either due to an applied magnetic field or due to a magnetic ordering. We perform a detailed theoretical and experimental study of the photoluminescence (PL) nonreciprocity in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal antiferromagnet CuB$_2$O$_4$, where this effect reaches 80\\% below the N\\'eel phase transition temperature of $T_N = 20$~K. The effect is observed for three sets of extremely narrow exciton and exciton-magnon PL lines, associated with Frenkel excitons on the Cu$^{2+}$ ions in the magnetic $4b$ subsystem. A strong manifestation of the nonreciprocity of emission is found in certain geometries for the commensurate antiferromagnetic phase, as well as in other phases with incommensurate spin ordering. In accordance with the magnetic symmetry of CuB$_2$O$_4$, the nonreciprocity of emission is observed for light propagation along certain directions within the easy (001) plane. A rigorous quantum-mechanical analysis of the wave functions of the initial and final states of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions responsible for the PL is performed for various experimental geometries of the crystallographic axes and the applied magnetic field. The analysis confirms that the nonreciprocity of emission from Frenkel excitons in CuB$_2$O$_4$ is due to the interference of magnetic-dipole and electric-dipole transitions of antiferromagnetically ordered $4b$ spins of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions, in good agreement with the experimental data."

Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering down to $1.8$~K in spite of a significant antiferromagnetic exchange between Yb$^{3+}$ moments, suggesting a frustrated magnetic system. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate insulating behavior, consistent with the localized nature of magnetic moments.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals reveals weak magnetic anisotropy.

The low-temperature photoluminescence emission confirms the excellent quality of the rhombohedral stacking with unprecedented width for all phonon replicas at the band edge. The Raman spectra are characterized by the absence of any low-energy modes at $\\sim50$ cm$^{-1}$, the presence of an extended band around $800$ cm$^{-1}$ and an asymmetric high energy mode at $1366$ cm$^{-1}$.

We prove that: i) due to frustration, the conventional Swendsen-Wang approach to cluster dynamics turns out to suffer from a severe inefficiency, stemming from the mismatch between spin correlations and cluster connectivity; ii) the Kandel-Domany approach is extremely effective in the study of dissipative quantum qubits. We partition the double-chain into different types of plaquettes and minimize the weight of graphs containing antiferromagnetic bonds by using both analytic and numerical approaches.

By tuning interlayer tunneling and/or interaction, multiple phases can be generated. In the absence of interlayer interaction, three phase transitions appear when interlayer tunneling becomes sufficiently strong: (1) from two decoupled $\\nu=1/2$ Laughlin states to the Moore-Read state in bilayer systems; (2) from one $\\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state plus one $\\nu=1$ Moore-Read state to the Read-Rezayi $\\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ state in bilayer systems; (3) from three decoupled $\\nu=1/2$ Laughlin states to the Read-Rezayi $\\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ state in trilayer systems. Numerical calculations suggest that these transitions are third-order ones. We propose non-Abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory to describe them. If both interlayer tunneling and interaction are present, one-component or multi-component composite fermion liquids and Jain states can be realized. This leads to intricate phase diagrams that host multiple phase transitions and possibly exotic critical points."

      "summary": "The surface states of 3D topological insulators possess geometric structures that imprint distinctive signatures on electronic transport. A prime example is the Berry curvature, which controls electric frequency doubling via a higher order moment, called Berry curvature triple. In addition to the Berry curvature, topological surface states are expected to exhibit a nontrivial quantum metric, which plays a key role in governing nonlinear magnetotransport. However, its manifestation has yet to be experimentally observed in 3D topological insulators. Here, we provide evidence for a nonlinear response activated by the quantum metric of the topological surface states of Sb$_2$Te$_3$. We measure a time-reversal odd, nonlinear magnetoresistance that is independent of temperature and disorder below 30 K and is thus of intrinsic geometrical origin. Our measurements demonstrate the existence of quantum geometry-induced transport in topological phases of matter and provide strategies for designing novel functionalities in topological devices."

We find that the growth of the phase-separated region is arrested when shear is applied, with the average clusters size plateauing towards a value $R_s$ that remains constant over time. While activity enhances the resilience of clusters against shear-induced breakup, $R_s$ decreases with growing shear rate $\\dot\\gamma$, with an intermediate regime where $R_s\\propto \\dot\\gamma^{-1}$. We find that clusters in the stationary state are progressively less polarized and increasingly elongated with increasing shear. At the same time, we find a breaking in chiral symmetry of both rotation direction and internal organization of clusters: typically, dumbbells point towards the cluster center with a small non-zero angle, such that the active torque opposes the shear torque, with cluster's angular velocity well captured by a simplified analytical model. We argue this conformation makes clusters more stable against shear."

The experiments provide direct access to the low-energy electrodynamics and key materials parameters such as superconducting energy gap and superfluid density. Our findings indicate that ZrN is a weakly coupled BCS-type superconductor with a gap-to-Tc ratio of approximately 3.4 in the thick film limit. For thinner films, this coupling ratio increases up to 4.0, departing from the BCS prediction. The results establish large-scale ZrN thin films as promising material for high-frequency superconducting applications."

Here we present a universally applicable approach, based on projection operators, that yields gauge-invariant absolute measures for all types of electric and magnetic order in crystals. We demonstrate the utility of the general theory using concrete examples of electric and magnetic multipole order in variants of lonsdaleite and diamond structures. Besides the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, we also consider, e.g., the magnetic octupole density in altermagnets. The robust method developed in this work lends itself to be incorporated into the suite of computational materials-science tools. The multipole densities can be used as thermodynamic state variables including Landau order parameters."

      "summary": "Clinically, palpation is one of the important diagnostic methods to assess tumor malignancy. In laboratory research, it is well accepted that the bulk stiffness of the tumor and the surrounding tissue is closely correlated with the malignant state of the tumor. Here, we postulate that, in addition to tumor stiffness, tumor viscoelasticity - the fact that tumor tissue takes time to bounce back after compression, can also be used to evaluate the tumor malignancy state. In this work, we characterized the viscoelastic properties of breast tumor spheroids using a recently developed microfluidic compression device and a theoretical power law model. Breast tumor cells at varying malignant levels; a non-tumorigenic epithelial (MCF10A), moderately malignant tumor (MCF7) and triple negative metastatic tumor (MDA-MB-231) cells were used. Spheroids embedded within a 3D extracellular matrix were periodically compressed, and their strain responses were recorded using microscopic imaging. Our results revealed that the measured strain relaxation curves can be successfully described by a modified power law model, demonstrated that non-tumorigenic tumor spheroids were more elastic, exhibited shorter relaxation time and less plasticity than those of tumorigenic spheroids. Together, these results highlight that viscoelastic properties in addition to bulk stiffness of the tumor spheroids can serve as a complementary mechanical biomarker of tumor malignancy and demonstrate the validity of a modified power law model for the mechanical characterization of a living tissue."

In this work, we systematically investigate the universal scaling functions of Gr\\\"uneisen ratio in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin systems, including the transverse-field Ising model, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, the quantum $q$-state Potts model ($q=3,4$) and the $J_1$-$J_2$ columnar dimer model. Our approach employs the thermal tensor-network method for infinite-size 1D systems and the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) simulations for 2D systems, enabling precise calculations of the Gr\\\"uneisen ratio near QCPs. Through data collapse analysis, we extract the corresponding scaling functions, which establish quantitative frameworks to interpret magnetocaloric experiments and guide the development of ultralow-temperature refrigeration."

More than 100 years of research have led to several mechanisms and models describing how hydrogen interacts with lattice defects and leads to mechanical property degradation. However, solutions to protect materials from hydrogen are still scarce. Here, we investigate the role of interstitial solutes in protecting critical crystalline defects sensitive to hydrogen. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon in solid solutions at grain boundaries can efficiently prevent hydrogen segregation. We then realized this interface protection concept on martensitic steel, a material strongly prone to HE, by doping the most sensitive interfaces with different concentrations of boron and carbon. This segregation, in addition to stress relaxations, critically reduced the hydrogen ingress by half, leading to an unprecedented resistance against HE. This tailored interstitial segregation strategy can be extended to other metallic materials susceptible to hydrogen-induced interfacial failure"

Seebeck coefficient measurements under magnetic fields up to 9 T show complex temperature and field dependence, which we decomposed into electron diffusion, spin fluctuation drag, and magnon drag components. A significant magnon-drag contribution was identified in both austenite and martensitic phases. Remarkably, this contribution is strongly enhanced in the martensitic phase compared to the austenite phase, despite a smaller magnetic moment.

Inclusion of the Gilbert damping modifies the continuity equation, resulting in the violation of the dipole moment conservation but not of the topological charge. Thiele's equation for the CP$^{N-1}$ skyrmion follows from the modified continuity equation. The Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra in the long-wavelength limit is derived for arbitrary CP$^{N-1}$ fluid. In the case of CP$^2$ skyrmions, we identify two kinds of energetically stable skyrmions in which the quadrupolar moments or the ferromagnetic moments are dominant. In the latter case, one can associate a nonzero CP$^1$ charge equal to half the CP$^2$ skyrmion charge and argue that the topological Hall effect of electrons should exist due to their coupling to the ferromagnetic part of the CP$^2$ texture."

By imposing active cyclic flipping of states, finite-length waves emerge in the long-term limit. This study focuses on coarsening dynamics from an initially random mixture of states to these moving-domain states. When spiral waves appear in the final state, the correlation length follows the Lifshitz--Allen--Cahn (LAC) law ($\\propto t^{1/2}$) until saturation is observed at the characteristic wavelength. By contrast, in the case of nonspiral waves, the growth rate is raised prior to the saturation, leading to a transient increase in the coarsening exponent. Moreover, the mean cluster size exhibits a similar form of transient increase under most of the conditions. In factorized symmetry modes at $q=6$, domains composed of two or three states similarly follow the LAC law. Finally, this study confirmed that the choice of lattice type (square or hexagonal) and update scheme (Metropolis or Glauber) does not alter the dynamic behavior."

In this work, we investigate the quasi-one-dimensional NH attractive Fermi-Hubbard model by using NH BCS theory. We demonstrate that, when the system is regarded as weakly-coupled chains, the exceptional SF phase becomes unstable and metastable (exceptional) SF state appears between the stable SF and normal states. In the one-dimensional limit, the exceptional SF disappear entirely and EPs only appear on the phase boundary between the normal and SF states. These results reveal how dimensional crossover governs the stability of the exceptional SF, providing the insights into the interplay between dimensionality and dissipation, with potential relevance for experimental implications in ultracold atoms."

This is based on the widely held view that the Mott-Hubbard mechanism drives the insulating behaviour of its charge density wave ground state, resulting in localized spins, interacting antiferromagnetically, on a geometrically frustrated lattice. However this assumes layer-wise independent behaviour. A growing body of evidence shows not only that inter-layer interactions are very significant in 1T-TaS2, but also that they mediate some of its most interesting functional properties. Here we offer a perspective from the point of view of scanning tunnelling microscopy that helps to visualize the microscopic degrees of freedom of inter-layer interactions in bulk 1T-TaS2, and the associated impact on the local density-of-states, including the occurrence of multiple distinct insulating phases. We consider to what extent the bulk of 1T-TaS2, and its surface terminations can be considered as Mott insulating and whether, or where, quantum spin liquid behaviour might persist. To better understand the bulk behaviour we also draw insights from measurements on isolated monolayers of 1T-TaX2 and 1T-NbSe2, where the confounding complications of inter-layer interactions are absent. We highlight some outstanding questions raised by a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results, and finally suggest future experiments that could address them."

We observe two stages of evolutions: surface reconstruction and atom leaching, which are corroborated with the voltage-dependent behaviors probed by in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy. We identify chemical short-range order at atomic level and further reveal anisotropic chemical redistributions across different crystallographic orientations. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions into the rational design of functional nanocatalysts in the future."

      "summary": "Predicting the Curie temperature ($T_\\mathrm{C}$) of magnetic materials is crucial for advancing applications in data storage, spintronics, and sensors. We present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict $T_{\\mathrm{C}}$ using a curated dataset of 2,500 ferromagnetic compounds, employing two types of elemental descriptor-based features: one based on stoichiometry-weighted descriptors, and the other leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). CatBoost trained on the stoichiometry-weighted descriptors achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.87, while the use of GNN-based representations led to a further improvement, with CatBoost reaching an $R^2$ of 0.91, highlighting the effectiveness of graph-based feature learning. We also demonstrated that using an uncurated dataset available online leads to poor predictions, resulting in a low $R^2$ score of 0.66 for the CatBoost model. We analyzed feature importance using tools such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which revealed that ionization energies are a key physicochemical factor influencing $T_\\mathrm{C}$. Notably, the use of only the first 10 ionization energies as input features resulted in high predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ scores of up to 0.85 for statistical models and 0.89 for the GNN-based approach. These results highlight that combining robust ML models with thoughtful feature engineering and high-quality data, can accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.

      "summary": "A central mystery in high-temperature cuprate superconductors is the coexistence of multiple exotic orders, which is presumably associated with strong electronic correlation. The ongoing interest in this enigmatic phenomenon is further energized when similar electronic orders and states emerge and coexist in less correlated Kagome superconductors. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and first-principles calculations, we reveal the sudden emergence of a distinct short-range charge stripe order in Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ Kagome superconductors when the long-range $2 \\times 2$ charge density wave order in pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is suppressed. This short-range stripe order features a modulation vector of approximately 1/3 along one of the three lattice directions, induces remarkable quasiparticle scattering between the original quasi-1D Kagome-d-bands and their replica of folding, and clearly suppresses the electron density of states at the Fermi level. Our first-principles calculations reveal that $3 \\times 1$ supermodulation represents a hidden secondary instability in pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This instability is further enhanced by in-plane chemical pressure induced by Sn substitution, and coupled to the electronic correlation, leading to a unique charge stripe order in the system. As such, our results reveal a new route toward emergent electronic orders via cooperative interactions between the lattice and electronic degrees of freedom."

However, the requirement for extremely high pressures limits their practical applications. In this study, YH4 is adopted as a base material, with partial substitution of Yttrium (Y) by Scandium (Sc), Lanthanum (La), and Zirconium (Zr). Pure YH4, stable at 120 GPa, exhibits a critical temperature (Tc) of 84-95 K. Substituting half of the Y atoms increases Tc to 124.43 K for (Y,Sc)H4 at 100 GPa but reduces it to 101.24 K for (Y,La)H4 at 120 GPa. In contrast, (Y,Zr)H4 at 200 GPa shows a further suppressed Tc of 69.55 K. The remarkable superconductivity in (Y,Sc)H4 might be related to its unique phonon dispersion without optical-acoustic gap, compressed Y-H bonds, and significant electron delocalization under pressure, collectively boosting electron-phonon interactions. Furthermore, the lowest optical phonons play a crucial role in the superconductivity of these materials. This work suggests that substituting Y with same-group metal elements is an effective strategy to enhance Tc in hydride superconductors."

      "summary": "In this work, we study a Josephson junction with parallel-connected quantum dots (QDs) threaded by a magnetic flux in the central region. We discretize the superconducting (SC) electrode into three discrete energy levels and modify the tunneling coefficients to construct a finite-dimensional surrogate Hamiltonian. By directly diagonalizing this Hamiltonian, we compute the physical quantities of the system. Additionally, we employ a low-energy effective model to gain deeper physical insight. Our findings reveal that when only one QD exhibits Coulomb interaction, the system undergoes a phase transition between singlet and doublet states. The magnetic flux has a minor influence on the singlet state but significantly affects the doublet state. When both QDs have interactions, the system undergoes two phase transitions as the SC phase difference increases: the ground state evolves from a doublet to a singlet and finally into a triplet state at $\\phi = \\pi$. Increasing the magnetic flux suppresses the doublet and triplet phases, eventually stabilizing the singlet state. In this regime, enhancing the interaction strength does not induce a singlet-doublet transition but instead drives a transition between upper and lower singlet states, leading to a critical current peak as $U$ increases. Finally, we examine the case where the tunneling coefficient $\\Gamma$ exceeds the SC pairing potential $\\Delta$. Here, doublet states dominate, and the system only exhibits a phase transition between doublet and triplet states when $\\phi_B = 0$. In the presence of a magnetic flux, the three states converge, resulting in a triple point in the ($\\phi$, $\\phi_B$) parameter space."

We observe two previously unknown growth regimes. In the first case, the sample is positioned within three to five millimeters of the plasma, leading to a decreased growth rate, compared to a position inside the plasma and, additionally, to an increased nitrogen incorporation, allowing the fabrication of delta-doped layers with a thickness below 30 nm. In another regime, where the sample is more than 10 mm away from the plasma, no growth is observed. Instead, we assume a deposition of nitrogen-rich species on the diamond surface, which is incorporated during the growth of the following layer. All fabricated layers show NV emission, where the intensity correlates with the nitrogen incorporation. The growth techniques could allow the fabrication of highly doped thin films for quantum sensing applications, as well as layers with low NV concentration, for quantum computing. The new approaches are applicable not only for nitrogen incorporation but also for other defects, for example, phosphorus, which could open up new avenues for diamond-based electronics."

We further demonstrate that the intensity scale factor derived from crystallographic refinements using Bragg peaks is in close agreement with that obtained by matching the scattering function, computed via spherical integration of the 3D total scattering signal, to the theoretical coherent baseline, calculated as the spherical average of the Debye-Waller factor. The latter approach can be applied to diffuse scattering without including Bragg peaks. Our results set the ground for structural refinements using large atomic configurations while simultaneously fitting Bragg intensities and diffuse scattering from a single crystal. Moreover, with the convergence between the two scaling methods, the Bragg and diffuse components can be obtained from the same total-scattering dataset, as achieved in this work, or measured independently."

      "summary": "Continued miniaturization of transistors is critical for sustaining advances in computing performance, energy efficiency, and integration density. A central nanoscale challenge is controlling gate leakage through ultrathin dielectrics. In evaluating candidate insulators, permittivity and bandgap are often emphasized; however, interfaces between two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors and gate dielectrics typically form a van der Waals (vdW) gap whose electronic properties are underappreciated. Using first-principles calculations and analytical modeling supported by experiment, we find typical vdW gaps of about 1.4 \\AA{} with an effective dielectric constant near 2, which adds roughly 2.7 \\AA{} to the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT). The vdW gap serves as an additional tunneling barrier that can reduce gate leakage by one to two orders of magnitude, but it also introduces parasitic capacitance that can offset the benefits of high-k dielectrics. We introduce a dimensionless figure of merit that combines dielectric screening, tunneling suppression, and thickness-dependent permittivity of ultrathin oxides to predict the minimum achievable EOT for a target gate-leakage current in the presence of a vdW gap. Although some materials may benefit from vdW gaps, our results indicate they often impose severe constraints on further scaling. In particular, due to the vdW gap, most currently considered insulators are unlikely to scale to an EOT of 5 \\AA{} as targeted by the IRDS roadmap for future nodes. As a potential alternative, we examine ``zippered'' structures in which quasi-covalent bonding between 2D layers eliminates the vdW gap while avoiding dangling bonds."

The springs obey the FENE-Fraenkel force law, a bending potential is used to capture chain stiffness and hydrodynamic interactions are included through the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor. By calculating the relaxation modulus following a step strain, we demonstrate that the bead-spring chain behaves like an inextensible semiflexible rod over a wide time window with an appropriate choice of spring stiffness and chain extensibility. In the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, our results agree with the existing theoretical predictions for the linear viscoelastic response of free-draining, inextensible, semiflexible rods in dilute solutions. It is shown that at intermediate times, the stress relaxation modulus exhibits power law behaviour, with the exponent ranging from $(-1/2)$ for flexible chains to $(-5/4)$ for highly rigid chains. At long times, rigid chains undergo orientational relaxation, while flexible chains exhibit Rouse relaxation. Hydrodynamic interactions are found to effect the behaviour at intermediate and long times, with the difference from free-draining behaviour increasing with increasing chain flexibility. Computations of the frequency dependence of loss and storage moduli are found to be in good agreement with experimental data for a wide variety of systems involving semiflexible polymers of varying stiffness across a broad frequency range."

Due to their toxicity and environmental persistence, reliable detection and monitoring methods are required. Hybrid organic--inorganic structures have shown potential for NAC sensing; however, their complex synthesis, high processing costs, and limited reproducibility hinder practical implementation, highlighting the need for simpler and more accessible materials. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to evaluate the electronic, optical, and reactive properties of two melanin-based oligomeric systems, aiming to assess their potential use as NAC detectors. Our results indicate the potential of these materials to detect a series of nitroaromatic compounds such as 2,4-DNP, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, TNP, and TNT by electrical and infrared optical measurements. Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations reveal the thermal stability of the adsorption process, confirming effective substrate--analyte interaction under different temperature conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this compound has not been proposed for sensing applications. Its low cost and facile synthesis make it a promising candidate for the development of environmentally friendly organic NAC sensors."

They are constructed by supplementing the magnetic coupling with $n_t-1$ nematic terms of exponentially increasing order with the base $q=2,3,4$ and $5$, and increasing interaction strength. It is found that for $q=2,3$ and $4$ with sufficiently large coupling strength of the final term, the models exhibit a number of phase transitions equal to the number of the terms in the generalized Hamiltonian. Starting from the paramagnetic phase, the system transitions through the cascade of $n_t-1$ nematic phases of the orders $q^{k}$, $k=n_t-1,n_t-2,\\hdots,1$, that are characterized by $q^{k}$ preferential spin directions symmetrically disposed around the circle, to the ferromagnetic (FM) phase at the lowest temperatures. Besides the BKT transition from the paramagnetic phase, all the remaining transitions have a non-BKT nature: depending on the value of $q$ they belong to either the Ising ($q=2$ and $4$) or the three-states Potts ($q=3$) universality class. For $q=5$, due to the interplay between different terms, the phase transitions between the ordered phases observed for $q<5$ split into two and the number of the ordered phases increases to $2n_t-1$. These phases are characterized by a domain structure with the gradually increasing short-range FM ordering within domains that extends to different kinds of FM ordering in the last two low-temperature phases. The respective transitions do not seem to obey any universality."

We report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of the layered quaternary intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$, which combines structural units of two known magnetic topological materials, EuCuAs and EuZn$_2$As$_2$. Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with successive magnetic transitions: quasi-two-dimensional ordering at $T_\\mathrm{M} = 29.3$\\,K, long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_\\mathrm{N} = 19$\\,K, and spin-reorientation at $T_\\mathrm{SR} = 16.3$\\,K. The stepwise magnetic transitions manifest as plateau-like anomalies in the heat capacity. These transitions originate from multiple superexchange pathways and periodic variation of interplane Eu-Eu distances in the intergrowth structure. Charge transport shows a pronounced resistivity increase above $T_\\mathrm{N}$ followed by minimal change below the ordering temperature. Magnetic fields rapidly suppress this resistivity rise, yielding significant negative magnetoresistance. Remarkably, Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ inherits the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect characteristic of its parent compounds. Energy evaluations of collinear spin configurations reveal a lowest-energy state with ferromagnetic coupling between Eu planes in EuCuAs units while maintaining antiferromagnetic coupling within EuZn$_2$As$_2$ units. The corresponding electronic structure displays potentially topologically nontrivial features. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of structural hybridization for discovering novel magnetic topological materials and establishes a general strategy for materials discovery."

      "summary": "We elucidate how the strong coupling phases of a coupled driven model, originally proposed in S. Mukherjee, Phys. Rev. E 108, 024219 (2023), are affected by noise cross correlations in general dimensions $d$. This model has two dynamical variables, where one of the variables is autonomous being independent of the other, whereas the second one depends explicitly on the former. By employing model coupling theories, we study the strong coupling phase of model. We show that the scaling laws in the strong coupling phase of the second field depend strongly on the strength of the noise cross correlations: the roughness exponent of the second field varies continuously with the noise cross correlation amplitude. As the latter amplitude rises, the roughness exponent gradually decreases, suggestion a novel suppression of the fluctuations of the second field in the strong coupling phase by noise cross correlations. We discuss the phenomenological implications of our results."

      "summary": "Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 4%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures."

      "summary": "DNA origami nanostructures provide programmable control over nanoscale geometry but remain challenging to image due to their low atomic number. Here, we systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained DNA origami deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids. Using Weber contrast as a quantitative metric, we compared different operating modes of (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, in order to find optimum imaging conditions. STEM was consistently found to deliver the highest contrast, with optimal performance at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. As expected, the contrast was higher for the thicker three-dimensional nanotubes as compared to DNA 6-helix bundles (6HBs) due to the larger projected thickness of the former. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate. Notably, 3D molds preserved their designated dimensions upon staining and also largely retained their structural integrity upon complexation with palladium, which also improved the visibility of the structures. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami even of unstained samples and provide practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging conditions that promote reliable structural visualization."

      "summary": "Entangled networks are ubiquitous in tissues, polymers, and fabrics. However, their mechanics remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the topological constraints at the network level. Here, we develop a mathematical framework that models entangled networks as graphs, capturing topological constraints of entanglements. We prove that entanglements reduce system energy by enabling uniform tension along chains crossing entanglements and by redistributing stress through sliding. Under this framework, we study elasticity and fracture, validated by experiments on entangled fabrics and hydrogels. For elasticity, entanglements increase strength by enabling stress homogeneity in the network. For fracture, entanglements enhance toughness by mitigating stress concentration around crack tips. We discover counterintuitive physical laws governing crack-tip stretch during crack opening: stress deconcentration at small deformation, constitutive-law independence at intermediate deformation, and linear scaling at large deformation. This framework establishes fundamental principles of linking topology to mechanics of entangled networks and offers a foundational tool for designing reconfigurable materials."

      "summary": "Molecular closed shell structures are known to form spin-singlet configurations, resulting from the spin-exchange associated with electron-electron interactions. While the vanishing total spin-moment is an immanent property of the spin-singlet, the vanishing local moments is a result of fluctuations between degenerate spin-configurations. Here, it is demonstrated that the spin-configuration of a chiral molecule is enantiospecifically locked when coupled to an electron reservoir. The coupling opens up the molecular closed shell structure, which broadens the energy levels. Together with the molecular spin-orbit coupling, this dissipative coupling generates an effective spin-splitting of the molecular energy levels and facilitates stabilization of a chirality determined spin-configuration. Simultaneously, the charge molecular charge distribution is shown to depend linearly on the magnetization of the reservoir such that no linear response regime is established with respect to the external magnetization. Accordingly, the Onsager reciprocity theorem does not apply to a chiral molecule attached to a reservoir, hence, providing a theoretical foundation for the chirality induced spin selectivity effect."

      "summary": "The role of active stress on the conformational dynamics of a polymer has drawn significant interest due to its potential applications in understanding the energy landscape of protein structures, buckling of biopolymers, genomic spatial organization, and their large scale coherent dynamics. We present a model of bidirectional active force that acts along the polymer's tangent, with its direction stochastically reversing between head to tail and tail to head orientations. The active polymer shows a structural transition from a random coil like state to a compressed state with variations in the active force, directional (polarity) reversal rate, and their fraction. Furthermore, the polymer re-swells and stretches more than its passive limit for a large active force. The polymer's radius of gyration follows the ideal chain-like scaling relation in both the compressed and swelled states. The bidirectional active force also drives dynamical transitions, where the effective diffusivity abruptly shifts from a linear to quadratic increase. Similarly, in the regime of large activity, the linear decrease of the longest relaxation time of the polymer changes to a power law behavior. We have shown that the active polymer's conformational, relaxation, and diffusive behaviors display a transition from an active polar linear polymer model (APLP) to an active Brownian particle (ABP) polymer model with the increase in the fraction of the opposite polarity and their reconfiguration time."

      "summary": "This work explores the role of oxygen in industrial methane oxidation. Oxygen, a well-known oxidizing agent, drives CH$_4$ conversion to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O. We report how oxygen influences oxidation on single Pd and PdO clusters supported on CeO$_2$(111). Oxygen is introduced by (1) lattice O in PdO and (2) O$_2$ adsorption on an isolated Pd atom, forming PdO$_x$ clusters. Density-functional theory (DFT) mapped multiple reaction pathways on the Pd$_1$/PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111) surface; both Pd and PdO clusters were found to thermodynamically favour methane activation. The computed barrier for CH$_4$ activation is 0.63 eV on PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111). A single Pd atom markedly accelerates O$_2$ dissociation to PdO$_2$, and the presence of lattice oxygen lowers this barrier by 0.36 eV relative to an oxygen-deficient surface, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Reaction selectivity, coverage-dependent production rates, degree of rate control (DRC), and intrinsic turnover frequency (TOF) were quantified through steady-state microkinetic modelling. The simulations predict full conversion of CH$_4$ to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O above 600 K, whereas partial-oxidation intermediates dominate at lower temperature and high O coverage. Rate constants for all elementary steps were derived via the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) symbolic-regression method, yielding a concise predictive expression based on charge, coordination number, and key Pd-O/C-H distances. These combined DFT-microkinetic-SISSO results clarify oxygen's mechanistic participation and provide practical guidelines for designing Pd/CeO$_2$ catalysts with improved activity toward methane oxidation, a reaction of pressing environmental and industrial importance."

First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, which is defined by the model with power law interaction, keeping only interactions between adjacent spins. We show that the distribution of the absolute value of the couplings is the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. However, the sign of the couplings becomes distributed, and the number of negative couplings increases with temperature $T.$ Next, we derive the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins with power exponent $\\alpha$. While the sign of the couplings is found to be distributed, the distribution of the coupling amplitude is given by the strong disorder distribution with finite width $2\\alpha,$ with small corrections for $\\alpha >2$. Resulting finite temperature properties of both short and power law long ranged spin systems are derived, including the magnetic susceptibility, concurrence and entanglement entropy."

Since the CO2RR takes place in aqueous solution, the detailed atomic structure of the water-copper interface is essential for unraveling the key reaction mechanisms. In this study, we investigate copper-water interfaces exhibiting nanometer-scale roughnesses. We introduce two molecular dynamics protocols to create rough copper surfaces, which are subsequently brought into contact with water. From these interfaces, we sample additional training configurations from machine-learning-interatomic-potential-driven molecular dynamics simulations containing hundreds of thousands of atoms. An active learning workflow is developed to identify regions with high spatially resolved uncertainty and convert them into DFT-feasible cells through a modified amorphous matrix embedding approach. Finally, we analyze the local environments at the interface using unsupervised machine-learning techniques. Unique environments emerge on the rough copper surfaces absent from model systems, including stacking-fault-induced configurations and undercoordinated corner atoms. Notably, corner atoms consistently feature chemisorbed water molecules in our simulations, indicating their potential importance in catalytic processes."

The partially filled 5f shells exhibit complex behavior due to strong correlations and ligand hybridization, requiring advanced spectroscopic techniques. Here, we report on the development and application of high-resolution valence-band resonant inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (VB-RIXS) experiments at the uranium M$_{4,5}$ edges (3551 and 3725\\,eV). We present data of UO$_2$, a well-established model actinide compound. VB-RIXS is particularly well suited for probing the 5f-shell electronic structure, as it probes, in contrast to core-to-core RIXS, excitations without leaving a high-energy core hole in the final state. In VB-RIXS, we achieve energy resolutions of 50\\,meV (M$_5$) and 90\\,meV (M$_4$), enabling the resolution of multiplet excitations and crystal-field effects, as well as charge-transfer and fluorescence-like features with unprecedented clarity. As such, high resolution VB-RIXS offers direct insights into both low-energy, near ground-state properties and high-energy hybridization and covalency effects. Our results demonstrate the power of VB-RIXS as a versatile and powerful tool for probing the strongly correlated electronic structure of actinide materials, providing essential input for quantitative modeling and the validation of theoretical concepts."

By enabling accurate, long-time scale simulations, machine learning (ML) models have the potential to accelerate the discovery of (electro)catalysts. While prior Open Catalyst datasets (OC20 and OC22) have advanced the field by providing large-scale density functional theory (DFT) data of adsorbates on surfaces at solid-gas interfaces, they do not capture the critical role of solvent and electrolyte effects at solid-liquid interfaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) dataset, consisting of 7,801,261 calculations across 1,511,270 unique explicit solvent environments. OC25 constitutes the largest and most diverse solid-liquid interface dataset that is currently available and provides configurational and elemental diversity: spanning 88 elements, commonly used solvents/ions, varying solvent layers, and off-equilibrium sampling. State-of-the-art models trained on the OC25 dataset exhibit energy, force, and solvation energy errors as low as 0.1 eV, 0.015 eV/\\r{A}, and 0.04 eV, respectively; significantly lower than than the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA-OC20). Additionally, we discuss the impact of the quality of DFT-calculated forces on model training and performance. The dataset and accompanying baseline models are made openly available for the community. We anticipate the dataset to facilitate large length-scale and long-timescale simulations of catalytic transformations at solid-liquid interfaces, advancing molecular-level insights into functional interfaces and enabling the discovery of next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies."

The EMCD signal, detected from single atomic Fe columns, reveals a marked reduction and sign reversal in the magnetic moment at Ti-rich 4f2 sites, corroborated by inelastic scattering simulations and density functional theory calculations that indicate induced Fe2+ formation and modified exchange interactions. Our results show that EVBs enable direct, element-specific, and atomically resolved magnetic characterization, opening new avenues for investigating local magnetic phenomena and dopant effects in nano-structured magnetic materials, such as those used in spintronic devices.

ML algorithms are often employed to learn low-dimensional representations of conformational landscapes and to cluster trajectories into relevant metastable states. Most of these algorithms require selecting a small number of features that describe the problem of interest. Although deep neural networks can tackle large numbers of input features, the training costs increase with input size, which makes the selection of a subset of features mandatory for most problems of practical interest. Here, we show that random nonlinear projections can be used to compress large feature spaces and make computations faster without substantial loss of information. We describe an efficient way to produce random projections and then exemplify the general procedure for protein folding. For our test cases NTL9 and the double-norleucin variant of the villin headpiece, we find that random compression retains the core static and dynamic information of the original high dimensional feature space and makes trajectory analysis more robust."

MoS$_2$ can exist in both the semiconducting 1H phase and the metallic 1T phase, enabling phase-engineered homojunctions within a single material. First-principles electronic structure and quantum transport calculations show that phase-engineered 1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ homojunctions exhibit pronounced MIM-diode-like rectification originating from interfacial charge transfer at asymmetric 1T/1H interfaces. The charge transfer establishes interface dipole steps that impose a built-in potential drop across the 1H barrier, thereby generating a trapezoidal tunnel barrier at zero bias. In contrast, symmetric 1T/1H interfaces do not form interface dipoles and show no rectification. To clarify the microscopic origin, a lateral graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene junction is analyzed as a minimal MIM diode analogue with a simple interface and well-defined barrier, confirming that interface-induced dipoles, rather than work-function difference, enable the effect. The mechanism operates entirely within a single monolayer material system and does not rely on out-of-plane stacking, highlighting compatibility with phase patterning in 2D semiconductors. These results establish lateral 1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ as a fully 2D, single-material platform for MIM-diode-like rectification and position interface-dipole engineering as a general strategy for ultrathin in-plane diodes, high-frequency detectors, and energy-harvesting tunnel devices."

      "summary": "Molecular dynamics methods have proven their applicability for the reproduction and prediction of molecular conformations during the last decades. However, most of works considered dilute solutions and relatively short trajectories that limit insights into conformational dynamics. In this study, we investigate the conformational dynamics of sucrose in aqueous solution using microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations. For the most of the calculations we use the OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A-LBCC force field, but we also utilize OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A and GLYCAM06 for the comparison. We focused on the glycosidic linkage conformers and their lifetimes, glucopyranose and fructofuranose ring puckering. Our findings indicate that the $^1\\mathrm{C}_4$ glucopyranose ring conformation can stabilize the sucrose conformer, appeared only in the GLYCAM06 and OPLS-AA/1.14*CM1A force fields. All the results are strengthened by comparison with the available experimental data on NMR J-coupling constants and ultrasonic spectra."

      "summary": "Nonreciprocal interactions are widely observed in nonequilibrium systems, from biological or sociological dynamics to open quantum systems. Despite the ubiquity of nonreciprocity, its impact on phase transitions is not fully understood. In this work, we derive criteria to perturbatively assess whether nonreciprocity changes the universality class of pairs of asymmetrically coupled systems undergoing a phase transition. These simple criteria are stated in terms of the unperturbed critical exponents, in the spirit of the Harris criterion for disordered systems, and agree with numerical simulations. Beyond nonreciprocity, our approach provides guidelines for assessing how dynamical phase transitions are affected by perturbations."

Such resolution is critical for exploring thermodynamic signatures in low-dimensional materials, where conventional techniques fall short. By confining thermal excitation to microsecond timescales, this approach minimizes lateral heat diffusion, reduces heat capacity addenda to below 10^{-9} J K^{-1}, and achieves noise densities as low as 75 pJ K^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} mm^{-2}, unlocking precise thermodynamic characterization of subnanogram samples in areas as small as 30 x 30 \\mu m^{2}. The method delivers exceptional temperature homogeneity, as demonstrated by resolving sharp phase transitions, such as the antiferromagnetic transition in ultrathin CoO films, with unprecedented clarity. Its quasi-static operation is inherently compatible with external stimuli, including magnetic and electric fields, thereby expanding its utility for in-operando thermodynamic studies. This advancement establishes a robust and scalable platform for probing thermal phenomena in nanostructured and low-dimensional materials, significantly broadening the scope of nanocalorimetry."

In this study, the substitution of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ at the magnetic Ir$^{4+}$-site leads to a systematic decrease in unit cell volume keeping the monoclinic symmetry throughout, reflecting the effect of chemical pressure along with a gradual suppression of magnetic interactions. The parent compound ($x =$ 0) exhibits a ferromagnetic-like state with a Curie temperature of 92 K, which continuously evolves into an antiferromagnetic ground state upon full Ti substitution ($x =$ 1) with a Neel temperature of 14.6 K. Isothermal magnetization measurements reveal a hysteresis behavior with step-like feature at zero field, indicative of a noncollinear magnetic ordering. Additionally, the enhancement of magnetization under hydrostatic pressure on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ suggests the presence of piezomagnetic behavior. Thermal expansion measurements on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ highlight a coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. The pressure dependence of the transition temperature in the zero-pressure limit, calculated using Ehrenfest's relation, shows good agreement with magnetization data under applied pressure.First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations preformed for $x =$ 0, 0.5 and 1, further reveal that strong SOC associated with Ir plays a decisive role in shaping the electronic band structure, with the insulating gap progressively widening as Ti content increases from 0.28 eV ($x =$ 0), 0.44 eV ($x =$ 0.5), and 1.01 eV ($x =$ 1). The magnetic moment decreased more than 50\\% for $x =$ 0.5, showing the decrease in magnetic exchange pathways."

      "summary": "Ultracold polar molecules with microwave shielding provide a powerful platform for exploring quantum many-body physics with strong, anisotropic interactions. We develop an extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework for bosonic molecules under single microwave shielding, incorporating effective interactions and quantum fluctuations, and benchmark it against exact Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In the regime of positive scattering lengths, our approach captures superfluid, supersolid, and droplet phases with excellent accuracy. We show that elliptic microwave polarization induces direction-dependent superfluidity - absent in cylindrically symmetric systems - enabling tunable anisotropy and potential applications in directional quantum sensing. A quasi-1D theory reveals that roton softening and instabilities can be controlled via ellipticity, consistent with recent experiments. Furthermore, we find that the nature of the superfluid-to-supersolid transition is strongly influenced by the ellipticity: the transition is sharp at low ellipticity and continuous at higher values. This tunability offers a potential route for low entropy preparation of molecular supersolids via adiabatic ramps. While double shielding is often used experimentally, our results demonstrate that single-shielded molecules already offer rich, controllable behavior, laying the groundwork for future studies with more complex shielding schemes."

      "summary": "Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials. The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures. Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics."

Intercalation also modifies the band structure: dopants may hybridize with carbon orbitals and order into $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ or $2\\times2$ superstructures, introducing periodic potentials that fold the graphene $\\pi$ bands. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy further shows a pronounced flattening of the conduction band near the M points, producing higher-order van Hove singularities. These effects depend strongly on the dopant species and substrate, with implications for both many-body physics and transport. We construct effective tight-binding models that incorporate dopant ordering, carbon-dopant hybridization, and $\\pi$-band renormalization. Model parameters are obtained from density functional theory and reproduce dispersions observed in photoemission experiments. Using these models, we compute the optical conductivity and identify characteristic signatures associated with dopant ordering and hybridization. Our results provide a framework to interpret experimental spectra and to probe the superlattice symmetry of highly doped monolayer graphene."

      "summary": "The potential for reactive metal fuels to enhance the energetic output of high explosives has generated an enduring interest in the study of composite explosives. It has typically been demonstrated that added metal fuels can have little or even deleterious impact on the accelerating ability of composite military explosives relative to baseline performance. Often this has led to the assumption of limited reaction of the metal fuel over microsecond timescales. The widespread availability of Photonic Doppler Velocimetry has enabled time resolved measurement of accelerated confinement, ultimately demonstrating prompt reaction of metal fuels. Motivated by this observation, hydrocode modelling studies, and prior author's modifications of Taylor's tubular bomb model, we developed a differential equation form of Taylor's model in a manner where it is straightforward to add sources or phases. An afterburning version of the JWL equation of state was used to add energy to the gaseous products at a linear, time-dependent rate. The metal particles are assumed to remain in velocity equilibrium with the gaseous products and do not transfer heat or influence chemical composition. We focus exclusively on added aluminum as it remains the most ubiquitous choice of metal fuel. The model is initialized with a CJ state calculated from Cheetah 2.0 assuming the Al particles are inert in the detonation. JWL coefficients for the baseline explosive are also used. Qualitative agreement is observed between the model and previously published experiments."

Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials."

We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra."

Determining what parameters and geometry to use for the auxiliary modes, however, is non-trivial and involves many subtleties. In this paper we revisit this problem of pseudomode design and investigate some of these subtleties. In particular, we examine the scenario in which pseudomodes couple to each other, resulting in an effective spectral density that is no longer a sum of Lorentzians. We show that non-diagonalizability of the pseudomodes' effective single-particle non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can lead to terms in the effective spectral density which cannot be obtained by diagonalizable non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We also present a method for constructing the pseudomode parameters to exactly match a fit to a spectral density, and in doing so illuminate the enormous freedom in this process. The case of many uncoupled pseudomodes is explored, and we show how, contrary to conventional assumption, the effective spectral density does not necessarily converge in the limit of an infinite number of pseudomodes; we attribute this to the non-completeness of Lorentzians as basis functions. Finally, we discuss how the notion of effective spectral densities can also emerge in the context of scattering theory for non-interacting systems."

Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices have emerged as promising candidates for beyond von Neumann computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic computing, offering voltage-history-dependent switching that mimics synaptic and neural behaviors. Atomic-scale mechanisms, such as defect-driven filament formation and ionic transport, govern these switching processes. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of Tantalum Oxide based RRAM devices featuring both oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient switching layers. We analyze the dominant conduction mechanisms underpinning resistive switching and systematically evaluate how oxygen stoichiometry influences device behavior. Leveraging a bottom-up design methodology, we link material composition to electrical performance metrics-such as endurance, cycle-to-cycle variability, and multilevel resistance states-providing actionable guidelines for optimizing RRAM architectures for energy-efficient memory and computing applications."

      "summary": "Training machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) on total energies of molecular clusters using differential or transfer learning is becoming a popular route to extend the accuracy of correlated wave-function theory to condensed phases. A key challenge, however, lies in validation, as reference observables in finite-temperature ensembles are not available at the reference level. Here, we construct synthetic reference data from pretrained MLIPs and evaluate the generalizability of cluster-trained models on ice-Ih, considering scenarios where both energies and forces and where only energies are available for training. We study the accuracy and data-efficiency of differential, single-fidelity transfer, and multi-fidelity transfer learning against ground-truth thermodynamic observables. We find that transferring accuracy from clusters to bulk requires regularization, which is best achieved through multi-fidelity transfer learning when training on both energies and forces. By contrast, training only on energies introduces artefacts: stable trajectories and low energy errors conceal large force errors, leading to inaccurate microscopic observables. More broadly, we show that accurate reproduction of microscopic structure correlates strongly with low force errors but only weakly with energy errors, whereas global properties such as energies and densities correlate with low energy errors. This highlights the need to incorporate forces during training or to apply careful validation before production. Our results highlight the promise and pitfalls of cluster-trained MLIPs for condensed phases and provide guidelines for developing - and critically, validating - robust and data-efficient MLIPs."

      "summary": "With the completion of development and wound repair, as the epithelium approaches homeostasis, cell proliferation is reduced to a minimum. In parallel, cellular motion transitions from a migratory unjammed state to a quiescent jammed state. This quiescent state is commonly regarded as devoid of large-scale regional variations in cell-cycle re-entry and cellular mechanics. To the contrary, here we report that during late maturation there arises a heretofore unanticipated epithelial reticulum that is supracellular and spans multiple scales of length. This reticulum evolves dynamically and comprises two interpenetrating networks: large regions of cycling and mechanically tensed cells, embedded with islands of non-cycling and mechanically compressed cells. The islands of compressed cells emerge and grow in cell numbers, with gradual jamming and with reduced cellular rearrangements. We show how island growth is both reversible, by provoking unjamming, and detainable, by cell cycle arrest treatment. Moreover, the distribution of island sizes was found to conform to a power-law, thus leading us to employ a computational model of percolating critical networks. Together, the observations indicate that the newly discovered epithelial reticulum self-organizes close to but just shy of criticality - thus avoiding mergers of compressed cell islands. This quasi-criticality reframes epithelial homeostasis as a dynamic regional balance of forces and proliferation."

      "summary": "Entanglement dynamics are fundamental to quantum technologies, yet navigating their temporal profiles (trajectories) remains challenging. Here, we propose a scalable solid-state platform based on RKKY exchange, where two spin qubits couple to a central spin qudit that oscillatorily spin-polarizes the surrounding conduction electrons. We introduce the exchange-time integral (ETI), which maps the spatial motion of the qubits to a time-dependent exchange interaction and serves as an effective \"trajectory clock\" governing the system evolution. We focus specifically on entanglement trajectories initially near the entanglement-unentanglement boundary, with the distance to this boundary quantified by concurrence extended to include negative values. By alternating the sign changes of the exchange, implemented through vibrational motion of qubits, the ETI enables programmable entanglement trajectories. For in-phase and antiphase vibrations, including scenarios with controlled stopping at the RKKY exchange-free nodes, we identify distinctive trajectories: snake (repeatedly crossing the boundary), bouncing (immediately reversing upon reaching the boundary), boundary-residing (remaining at the transition point), and pulse (controllable entanglement intervals). The vibration phase creates asymmetric shifts to the trajectories. The proposed device offers built-in error correction against dephasing by utilizing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. Out-of-phase vibrations drive trajectories away from the boundary, accessing larger entanglement values but with irregular/unsteady final states. To stabilize these trajectories, we introduce a damping mechanism. Our framework offers a systematic method for navigating and engineering entanglement dynamics in quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum computation, cryptography, and metrology."

Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems."

      "summary": "The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only partial information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost in scenarios with multiple charges, which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound; and (ii) an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in observable fluctuations which are ubiquitous at nanoscale, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications."

The experimentally measured value for the gyromagnetic ratio or the spin g-factor of an electron in a vacuum agrees remarkably well with theoretical predictions, making it one of the biggest successes of quantum field theory. However, these factors may get modified compared to their vacuum counterparts due to the interaction present in the system. Motivating from that, in this article, we investigate the effects of interactions within the framework of $2+1$ dimensional Proca quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate how the g-factor and Pauli form factors change with the electron's Fermi velocity and the mass of the vector fields within Proca quantum electrodynamics."

However, the realization of qubits based on vdW materials other than graphene is yet to be achieved. In this work we present a weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit. Our device exhibits a relaxation time T1 = 6.5 +\\- 0.4 us which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger of other vdW qubits in addition to robustness to photon noise up to 5-10 thermal photons. Our work serves as a demonstrator of the advantage of integration of vdW materials into quantum technologies as well as serving as the first step toward the application of quantum non demolition photon detection protocols in the challenging field of dark matter search."

      "summary": "Fresnel wave surfaces, or isofrequency light shells, provide a powerful framework for describing electromagnetic wave propagation in anisotropic media, yet their applicability is restricted to reciprocal, lossless materials and far-field radiation. This paper extends the concept by incorporating near-field effects and non-Hermitian responses arising in media with loss, gain, or non-reciprocity. Using the Om-potential approach to macroscopic electromagnetism, we reinterpret near fields as off-shell electromagnetic modes, in analogy with off-shell states in quantum field theory. We show that photonic density of states (PDOS) distributions near Fresnel surfaces acquire Lorentzian broadening in non-reciprocal media, directly linking this effect to the Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law of exponential attenuation or amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how Abraham and Minkowski momenta, locked to light shells in the far field, naturally shift to characterize source structures in the near-field regime. This unified treatment bridges the gap between sources and radiation, on-shell and off-shell modes, and reciprocal and non-reciprocal responses. The framework provides both fundamental insight into structured light and practical tools for the design of emitters and metamaterial platforms relevant to emerging technologies such as 6G communications, photonic density-of-states engineering, and non-Hermitian photonics."

While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter."

A prevailing theory suggests that nitric oxide (NO) may induce nerve compression and irritation via vascular dilation, thereby being responsible for the condition, making real-time detection of generated NO critical. However, traditional evaluations of NO rely on indirect colorimetric or chemiluminescence techniques, which offer limited sensitivity and spatial resolution for its real-time assessment in biological environments. Herein, we reported the development of a highly sensitive NO electrochemical biosensor based cerium single-atom nanozyme (Ce1-CN) with ultrawide linear range from 1.08 nM to 143.9 {\\mu}M, and ultralow detection limit of 0.36 nM, which enables efficient and real-time evaluation of NO in TN rats. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed the high-performance biosensing mechanism, whereby the Ce centers in Ce1-CN nanoenzymes adsorb NO and subsequently react with OH- to form *HNO2. Results demonstrated that NO concentration was associated with TN onset. Following carbamazepine treatment, NO production from nerves decreased, accompanied by an alleviation of pain. These findings indicate that the biosensor serves as a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis of TN and guiding subsequent therapeutic strategies."

The topological phase diagram is ascertained through a spectral winding number. Furthermore, we derive the exact analytic formula for the phase boundaries that delineate different knot topologies. To explore the concrete physical implications of distinct knot topologies, we investigate the many-body ground state entanglement entropy for free fermions loaded on such non-Hermitian lattice in real space. It turns out that different knot topologies imply different magnitudes of entanglement. Moreover, we show that the central charge c extracted from systematic finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy provides effective description of the phase diagram of the knot topology. Finally, we further confirm the phase boundaries for the topological phase transitions alternatively by numerical calculations of the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility. Our results showcase the connection between knot topology and entanglement of non-Hermitian systems and may facilitate further exploration of the profound and practical physical implications of knot topology."

We used the relative change in rotator entropy as a measure of dynamical stability. This rotator dynamic is described by the Caldeira-Leggett quantum master equation: the main challenge is the absence of a general solution for this equation. As an alternative, we look for the initial states (pure or mixed) of the rotator that result in low entropy change. In order to create candidate initial states, we use an ansatz that align with the maximum entropy principle. We then find conditions for state preparation and system/bath parameters to achieve a small relative change in both linear and differential entropy in underdamped and non-underdamped regimes. We identify cases with relatively small entropy change and discuss their practical feasibility."

Depending on the parameters, lasers can offer versatile solutions for scientific and industrial applications, starting from exploring the fundamental physics of warm dense matter and molecular chemistry at ultrashort timescales to large-scale fabrication of surfaces with anti-bacterial, tribological, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic properties. The objectives of this Chapter are to provide a review of recent advancements in several laser application fields, which involve high-intensity lasers, both ultrashort (femto- and picosecond) and short (nanosecond). After summarizing general trends in high-intensity laser processing of materials, we will first focus on the new opportunities offered by high-intensity lasers for the controlled synthesis of multielement nanoparticles for catalytic and theranostic applications. Then, the blister-based laser-induced forward transfer (BB-LIFT) technique will be presented, allowing a one-step, high-precision printing of nanomaterials on any substrates. The next section will discuss the selective crystallization of amorphous (as prepared) semiconductor nanoscale materials. The processes enabling high selectivity of crystallization into the desired phase using ultrashort powerful lasers will be analyzed. After that, opportunities for using high-power lasers will be discussed for upscaling surface nanostructuring with high throughput for bio-medical and industrial applications. Finally, an introduction to the Open Access program of the HiLASE Centre, which is targeted at offering users high-intensity beam time, will be given."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) electronic materials are of significant technological interest due to their exceptional properties and broad applicability in engineering. The transition from nanoscale physics, that dictates their stable configurations, to macroscopic engineering applications requires the use of multiscale methods to systematically capture their electronic properties at larger scales. A key challenge in coarse-graining is the rapid and near-periodic variation of the charge density, which exhibits significant spatial oscillations at the atomic scale. Therefore, the polarization density field -- the first moment of the charge density over the periodic unit cell -- is used as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by exploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. Unlike the highly oscillatory charge density, the polarization varies over lengthscales that are much larger than the atomic, making it suitable for continuum modeling. In this paper, we investigate the electrostatic potential arising from the charge distribution of 2D materials. Specifically, we consider a sequence of problems wherein the underlying lattice spacing vanishes and thus obtain the continuum limit. We consider 3 distinct limits: where the thickness is much smaller than, comparable to, and much larger than the in-plane lattice spacing. These limiting procedures provide the homogenized potential expressed in terms of the boundary charge and dipole distribution, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions that are also obtained through the limit process. Further, we demonstrate that despite the intrinsic non-uniqueness in the definition of polarization, accounting for the boundary charges ensures that the total electrostatic potential, the associated electric field, and the corresponding energy of the homogenized system are uniquely determined."

Specifically, we show that by increasing either the interaction strength or the number of physical qubits in the chain, the logical qubit's pure dephasing rate is suppressed to zero, and its relaxation rate is reduced to half the relaxation rate of a single physical qubit.

To this goal, we rely on the commutant-algebra framework for the description of strong symmetries to introduce the unconventional strong-symmetry structure leading to the existence of anomalous stationary states, which we dub open-system quantum many-body scars (OSQMBS), besides a typical infinite-temperature state. We provide several benchmarks of the theoretical predictions on the stationary-state manifold and on convergence to stationarity, as well as describe the time-evolution of off-diagonal coherences among the Hilbert space symmetry sectors identified by OSQMBS and their orthogonal complement. Moreover, we investigate the existence of asymptotic OSQMBS (AOSQMBS), the latter being states that, despite converging to the typical infinite-temperature state in the large-time limit, display anomalously-large relaxation time scales, which we thoroughly describe by means of the behavior of their fidelity as a function of time through proper scaling Ansaetze."

      "summary": "We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\\mathcal{C} = \\text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions."

We discuss a rich set of properties that such retarded two-point functions must exhibit. We then show that the spectral duality relation and its implications apply to pairs of correlators in double-trace deformed CFTs and, more generally, to correlators in theories related by the Legendre transform. We illustrate, through several examples, how the spectrum of one correlator can be reconstructed from that of its dual correlation function. Notably, this includes cases relating the thermal spectra of scalar primary operators at ultraviolet and infrared fixed points, as well as current operators in a CFT$_3$ and its particle-vortex dual."

Factoring the graph Laplacian into the product of the incidence matrix and its transpose allows us to show that for a more complicated network, the steps must lie in a linear subspace determined by the graph topology. This provides a useful new perspective on the James--Guth theory of phantom elastic networks. In particular, we formulate phantom networks which are free from the constraints of fixed crosslinks. For a given network the solution of the loop constraints makes the partition function finite-valued in the path integral formulation without applying any external forces or fixing any monomer positions. The resulting probability distribution on edge displacements is rotationally invariant, which is practically quite useful for generating unbiased random samples of edge displacements and monomer positions. Furthermore, one can exactly calculate many physical quantities such as correlation functions with respect to this distribution. Finally, this reformulation lends itself well to the case of non-Gaussian distributions. We illustrate this by computing the expected radius of gyration of a ring polymer in a wide variety of models."

In simulations of both spring networks and packings of soft spheres, judicious choice of parent systems and bond removal allows for the selection of a wide variety of moduli and Poisson's ratios in the critically elastic systems, providing a framework for versatile deterministic selection of mechanical properties."

Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, the absence of comprehensive quantitative calculations has made these explanations less convincing. In our work, we introduce a methodology to study magnetotransport behaviors in magnetic materials. This approach integrates the anomalous Hall conductivity induced by the Berry curvature, with a multi-band ordinary conductivity tensor, employing a combination of first-principles calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Our method also incorporates the temperature dependence of the relaxation time and the anomalous Hall conductivity, as well as the field dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity. We initially test this approach on models, obtaining distinct behaviors of magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity across several types of magnetic materials, and then apply it to a Weyl semimetal, Co3Sn2S2. The results, which align well with experimental observations in terms of magnetic field and temperature dependencies, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. This methodology provides a comprehensive and efficient means to understand the underlying mechanisms of the unusual complex behaviors observed in magnetotransport measurements in magnetic materials."

Differentiating the ordinary Hall effect from extraordinary properties like the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is challenging, especially in materials with topological origins. In our study, we leverage semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and first-principles calculations within the relaxation time approximation to analyze Hall effects comprehensively. We have found that the complex magnetic field dependence of ordinary Hall effect, including the sign reversals, appearing of plateau and nonlinearity, can be understood and reproduced by our approach both for multiband models and realistic topological materials of ZrSiS and PtTe2. The Hall resistivity versus temperature and magnetic fields can be well scaled, similar to Kohler's rule for longitudinal resistivity. This methodology can also accurately model the angular dependent Hall effects such as planar Hall effects of bismuth. These findings indicate that the dependencies of various Hall effects and magnetoresistance on magnetic fields are mainly determined by the details of Fermi surface and the relaxation time. The intrinsic Fermi surface determines the carriers' density, type, and velocity, while the later is mostly influenced by extrinsic factors, such as quality of sample with defects, impurities, and domains. This insight might simplify the understanding of several seemingly complex transport phenomena in nonmagnetic materials, with no need for hypotheses of other sophisticated mechanisms, such as magnetization-induced AHE, Lifshitz transition-induced changes in carrier type, exotic orders like charge density wave, or some delicate scattering of carriers with chiral or nonreciprocal dependence. Finally, we also discussed the Hall effects contribute from the Berry curvature."

In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \\textit{ab\\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and as their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we show that the recoverable stored energy can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase due to a pinched double-loop field hysteresis."

      "summary": "Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) have been used in spintronic applications to decrease the magnetic field or the electric current required to act on the magnetization. A common belief is that a SAW alone cannot achieve a directed magnetic switching in a device without an assisting magnetic field or electric current. In this work, we demonstrate magnetic domain wall motion driven solely by an acoustic wave. Using XMCD-PEEM, we show extensive evidence of SAW-induced and field-free magnetic domain wall motion (DW) in the direction of the wave propagation. Our micromagnetic simulations reveal a mechanism that allows the SAW to transfer linear momentum to the DW. Experimentally, the largest DW average velocity measured was ~12 m/s, although our simulations predict that velocities in the range of 100 m/s could be attained. This new mechanism opens the door to designing innovative spintronic devices where the magnetization can be controlled exclusively by an acoustic wave."

As an example, we introduce a new circuit element, the Y-splitter, a superconducting loop with three leads and three Josephson junctions, smaller or comparable in size to the superconducting coherence length of the material. By tuning magnetic flux through an array of Y-splitters, Cooper-pair transport can be made to interfere destructively, while spatially separated split Cooper pairs propagate coherently. We consider an array of Y-splitters connected in a two-dimensional star [Archimedean (3,$12^2$)] geometry, deformable into the kagome lattice, and find a rich phase diagram that includes topological superconducting phases with Chern numbers $\\pm 2$. Experimental realization appears feasible."

      "summary": "The slime mould Physarum polycephalum has emerged as a model for self-organisation and coordination of contractile activity at large spatial scales. This self-organisation largely results from cytoplasmic flows generated by propagating contractile waves of the actomyosin cortex. In addition to these relatively fast travelling waves, complex slow modulations of the contractile activity have been observed on timescales much longer than the primary oscillation period; these slow dynamics are however scarcely characterised. Here we characterise these slow modulations by confining organisms inside annular geometries. We quantify contractile activity simultaneously across the entire organism on long time scales, exhibiting correlations between contractile wave direction, amplitude modulation, and the moving mean vein diameter. We observe travelling and alternating wave patterns: travelling wave periods scale clearly with system size, while alternating wave periods remain broadly distributed and probe larger values as the system size increases. Strikingly, the measured periods align with integer multiples of an intrinsic modulation time scale obtained independently from statistical analysis. These observations support the hypothesis that transport of a slowly advected chemical agent, which locally modifies membrane/cortex mechanical properties, underpins the observed slow modulation dynamics, accounting for the coordination across the organism on long time scales."

      "summary": "We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state."

The evolution of that ensemble is driven by the Boltzmann Equation, and the perturbed population is described by a power-law distribution function. In this work, as a new feature, instead the usual techniques the transient between both distributions is analysed using the moments of such distribution function and the Central Limit Theorem. This technique, together with the, ad hoc solved, equation of motion of the charges under this particular system of pulsed forces, allows to find the corresponding expressions relating the time pulse with the relaxation times and the dynamic conditions. We validate that new technique by comparison with the analytical expression using the corresponding relaxation time using an exact collision operator. Moreover, we parameterise this plasma to make numerical estimates in order to analyse the impact of relevant parameters involved in the physical process on such a relaxation time."

The intensity of phonon peaks in Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) spectra can be related to the underlying EPC strength under significant approximations whose validity deserves careful verification. We measured the Cu L$_3$ RIXS phonon intensity as function of incident photon energy and of momentum transfer in several layered cuprates. For CaCuO$_2$, La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$, and \\ch{YBa_2Cu_3O_{6}}, using a generally accepted theoretical model, we estimate quantitatively the EPC for the bond-stretching mode along the high-symmetry directions ($\\zeta$,0) and ($\\zeta$,$\\zeta$), and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\\varphi$ at fixed $q_\\parallel$. We compare our results with theoretical predictions and we find that the $\\mathbf{q}_\\parallel$-dependence of the phonon RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the phonon symmetry. However, a more satisfactory prediction of the experimental results requires an accurate description of the electronic structure close to the Fermi level. Our extensive investigation indicates that Cu L$_3$ RIXS can be reliably used to determine the momentum dependence of EPC for the bond-stretching modes of cuprates. Moreover, the large experimental basis provided in this article can serve as stringent test for advanced theoretical predictions on the EPC."

In information theory, Shannon entropy is a common measure of uncertainty. However, a clear quantitative relationship between the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics remains to be established. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution requires higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the sum of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\\ln 2$. As an application, we demonstrate our relation in the diffusion decision model, revealing a fundamental trade-off between decision accuracy and entropy production in stochastic decision-making processes."

In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems."

We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities."

In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration."

In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of the monolayer MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts."

      "summary": "Non-equilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multi-point correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-$N$ Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and non-local Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We provide understanding of our numerical and analytical large-$N$ results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the non-interacting SYK$_2$ model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYK$_{q\\geq 4}$ model thermalizes slower than the non-interacting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the non-local and/or multi-point quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes."

      "summary": "Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) provides direct insights into microscopic magnetic interactions in crystalline materials, making it a valuable experimental technique in condensed matter physics and materials science. These interactions can be extracted by fitting spin wave dispersions to Heisenberg Hamiltonians using spin wave theory. However, such datasets are scattered across the literature and lack a standardized format, which limits their accessibility, reproducibility, and utility. In this work, we compile and standardize exchange interaction data obtained from INS experiments on nearly 100 magnetic materials. The resulting dataset includes exchange parameters expressed in a unified Heisenberg model format, visualizations of crystal structures with annotated exchange pathways, and Monte Carlo simulation files generated using the ESpinS code. We use these experimentally derived exchange interactions to compute magnetic transition temperatures ($T_c$) via classical Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the $(S+1)/S$ correction in the simulations and find it improves agreement with experimental $T_c$ values in most cases. All data and related resources are openly available through a public GitHub repository."

Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint."

In several regions, we identify overlapping incommensurate moir\\'e patterns consistent with locally chiral trilayer stacking. We observe van Hove singularities and reconstructed Dirac-like spectra whose angle dependence supports strong interlayer electronic coherence. In the highly strained trilayered regions, we observe peaks in the local density-of states with characteristic scaling of the quantized Landau levels strikingly even in the absence of a magnetic field. They arise from the strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields (~ 26 T), making turbostratic graphene a single natural platform to explore the physics of moir\\'e structures as well as of the pseudo-electromagnetic fields."

In this work, we explore a novel example of a continuously tunable family of two-dimensional aperiodic tilings in which the underlying real-space geometry becomes a control knob of the wavefunction's quantum geometric tensor. The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems."

      "summary": "Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results support an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding."

In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\\\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. We describe also the time evolution during the process of relaxation to the thermal state and the time dependence of quantum von Neumann and classical Boltzmann entropies during this process. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed."

Specifically, we show that the average work required to erase the memory is always larger than the average work gained from the protocol. We also discuss concrete setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols."

As AlScN films are thinned to 10 nm thickness, coercive field has been shown to substantially increase, which hinders low voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase with scaling and improves ferroelectric performance. Here, we demonstrate robust ferroelectricity in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, the difference in dynamic switching behavior over a decade of frequency was evaluated by applying the KAI model. At frequencies lower than 16.7 kHz, the capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents of 0.030 and 0.028, indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent of 0.063, indicating a stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.030, suggesting a lower frequency dependence during faster switching scenarios. The Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction technique was selected to measure the strain difference in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, providing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain and switching behavior in ultra-thin film systems."

      "summary": "The surface roughness of a thin film at a liquid interface exhibits contributions of thermally excited fluctuations. This thermal roughness depends on temperature (T), surface tension ($\\gamma$) and elastic material properties, specifically the bending modulus ($\\kappa$) of the film. A non-zero $\\kappa$ suppresses the thermal roughness at small length scales compared to an interface with zero $\\kappa$, as expressed by the power spectral density (PSD) of the thermal roughness. The description of the X-ray scattering of the standard Capillary Wave Model (CWM), that is valid for zero $\\kappa$, is extended to include the effect of $\\kappa$. The extended CWM (eCWM) provides a single analytical form for both the specular XRR and the diffuse scattering around the specular reflection, and recovers the expression of the CWM at its zero $\\kappa$ limit. This new theoretical approach enables the use of single-shot grazing incidence X-ray off-specular scattering (GIXOS) measurements for characterizing the structure of thin films on a liquid surface. The eCWM analysis approach decouples the thermal roughness factor from the surface scattering signal, providing direct access to the intrinsic surface-normal structure of the film and its bending modulus. Moreover, the eCWM facilitates the calculation of reflectivity at any desired resolution (pseudo XRR approach). The transformation into pseudo XRR provides the benefit of using widely available XRR software to perform GIXOS analysis. The extended range of the vertical scattering vector (Qz) available with the GIXOS-pseudo XRR approach allows for a higher spatial resolution than with conventional XRR. Experimental results are presented for various lipid systems, showing strong agreement between conventional specular XRR and pseudo XRR methods. This agreement validates the proposed approach and highlights its utility for analyzing soft, thin films."

Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques."

In this computational study, we used charge-informed molecular dynamics with a fine-tuned CHGNet foundation potential to investigate the phase transformation in Li$_{x}$Mn$_{0.8}$Ti$_{0.1}$O$_{1.9}$F$_{0.1}$. Our results indicate that transition metal migration occurs and reorders to form the spinel-like ordering in an FCC anion framework. The transformed structure contains a higher concentration of non-transition metal (0-TM) face-sharing channels, which are known to improve Li transport kinetics. Analysis of the Mn valence distribution suggests that the appearance of tetrahedral Mn$^{2+}$ is a consequence of spinel-like ordering, rather than the trigger for cation migration as previously suggested. Calculated equilibrium intercalation voltage profiles demonstrate that the $\\delta$-phase, unlike the ordered spinel, exhibits solid-solution signatures at low voltage. A higher Li capacity is obtained than in the DRX phase. This study provides atomic insights into solid-state phase transformation and its relation to experimental electrochemistry, highlighting the potential of machine learning interatomic potentials for understanding complex oxide materials."

We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order."

      "summary": "Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As condensed matter physics applications, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices and analytically determine the asymptotics of the return probability. While the Archimedean lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two- or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices."

      "summary": "Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-P\\'erot interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias."

      "summary": "The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models."

      "summary": "Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method."

This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms for symmetry switching that electronic excitation-driven shear sliding plays a dominant role."

      "summary": "Quantum entanglement exists in nature but is absent in classical physics, hence it fundamentally distinguishes quantum from classical theories. While entanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly more challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we theoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In particular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate two experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite temperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically calculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below which the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is accessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the vicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with mutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by the coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain generalized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization. Moreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale extensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement between coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is largely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of entanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium regimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive entanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures."

We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed."

While previous studies have been concerned with one-dimensional systems, showing that the ground state structure can be described in terms of quasiparticle excitations, the two-dimensional setting remains unexplored. We address this gap by studying a three-legged antiferromagnetic quantum Ising ladder on a torus using tensor network methods, where topological frustration is induced by an odd number of spins along both spatial directions. Our results reveal the first instance in which topological frustration shifts the position of the quantum critical point. By studying the entanglement structure, we find that the ground state can be characterized as hosting three delocalized quasiparticles. This work builds the quasiparticle picture of topological frustration toward higher dimensions and more complex systems than those considered so far."

In biased bilayer graphene, for instance, theoretical predictions of valley g-factor for p-excitons deviate from experiment by nearly an order of magnitude. Here, we develop a quantum theory of exciton orbital magnetic moment that reveals several conceptually new terms absent in prior theories, including an unforeseen contribution from exciton band quantum geometry. Our ab initio calculations yield results in excellent agreement with measurements, establishing the importance of a full theory including interaction and topological effects for the magnetic response of excitons."

The search for topological materials using traditional first-principles and symmetry-based methods often requires lots of computing power or is limited by the crystalline symmetries. In this study, we present frequency-based statistical descriptors for machine learning-driven topological material's classification that is independent of crystallographic symmetry of wave functions. This approach predicts the topological nature of a material based on its chemical formula. With a balanced dataset of 3910 materials, we have achieved classification accuracies of 82\\% with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and 83\\% with the Random Forest (RF) model, where both models have trained on common frequency based features. We have verified the performances of the models using $5-fold$ cross-validation approach. Further, we have validated the models on a dataset of unseen binary compounds and have efficiently identified 22 common materials using both the models. Next, we implemented the $first-principles$ approach to confirm the topological nature of these predicted materials and found the topological signatures of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the implications of frequency-based descriptors is a practical and less complex way to find novel topological materials with certain physical post-processing filters.

In this work, the potential application of pristine as well as strategically Fe, Co, Ni-doped 2D AlSb was examined as a CO2RR electrocatalyst. The recation pathways of CO2RR intermediate complexes, overpotential, stability, efficiency, and selectivity were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Outstanding overpotentials were achieved with pristine and doped 2D AlSb: Ni-doped 2D AlSb was selective for HCOOH (0.12eV) and CH4 (0.28eV), and Fe-doped 2D AlSb for HCHO (0.31eV) and CH3OH (0.31eV). The opposing effects of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was mitigated with the application of electric potential and solution pH. The main reasons for the enhancement of catalytic effect due to doping with Fe, Co, and Ni are bandgap reduction and creation of states at the edge of the valence band due to the 3d orbitals of these dopants. Interestingly, the Fe-doped 2D AlSb catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Excellent electrocatalytic properties of pristine and doped 2D AlSb make them suitable as CO2RR catalysts contributing towards a green and sustainable energy ecosystem."

      "summary": "Erasure of the binary memory, 0 or 1, is an essential step for digital computation as it involves irreversible logic operations. In the classical case, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a minimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved in the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed within a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is observed that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat released, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this is a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time memory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the field of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to the two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However, the potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover, the two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in structure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the success rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released associated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier partitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving the efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the thermodynamic costs. We retrieve the approach towards the Landauer limit in terms of the energetics involved with the erasure mechanism under the symmetric setup."

In this communication we present a simple theoretical analysis how the transfer occurs for the Landau model of phase transition between cholesteric and chiral twist-bend liquid crystals. We found that the sign of the chiral heliconical spiral is always opposite to that of the cholesteric. Physics behind this relation is based on the orthogonality of the cholesteric director and vector order parameter of the heliconical phase."

Combining the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations with the magnetoelastic Hamiltonian, we derive classical equations of motion for the magnetization and acoustic wave amplitudes, that include magnonic nonlinearity -- both three- and four-magnon processes -- as well as linear and nonlinear magnetoelastic interactions. We focus on two-dimensional magnetic films sustaining surface acoustic waves, a geometry where our model successfully reproduces our recent experimental observation of phonon-to-magnon down-conversion under acoustic drive. We provide analytical expressions for all the rates in our equations, which make them particularly suitable for quantization. We then quantize our model, deriving Heisenberg-Langevin equations of motion for magnon and phonon operators, and show how to compute quantum expectation values in the mean field approximation. Our work paves the way toward acoustic control of magnons in the quantum regime."

In this paper, one of our goals is to explore the properties of pseudo-entropy and study its effectiveness as a quantum chaos diagnostic, i.e., as a tool to distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. Using various variants of the SYK model, we study the signal of quantum chaos captured in the pseudo-entropy and relate it to the spectral form factor (SFF) and local operator entanglement (LOE)."

In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\\sqrt{\\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\\text{(II)}}=4\\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\\mathcal{N} \\sim \\ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm."

This quantum advantage becomes particularly significant when a large number of particles are included in the sensing circuit. Achieving such enhancement requires introducing and preserving entanglement among many particles, posing significant experimental challenges. In this work, we integrate concepts from Floquet theory and quantum information to design an entangler capable of generating the desired entanglement between two paths of a quantum interferometer. We demonstrate that our path-entangled states enable sensing beyond the SQL, reaching the fundamental Heisenberg limit (HL) of quantum mechanics. Moreover, we show that a decoding parity measurement maintains the HL when specific conditions from Floquet theory are satisfied$\\unicode{x2013}$particularly those related to the periodic driving parameters that preserve entanglement during evolution. We address the effects of a priori phase uncertainty and imperfect transmission, showing that our method remains robust under realistic conditions. Finally, we propose a superconducting-circuit implementation of our sensor in the microwave regime, highlighting its potential for practical applications in high-precision measurements."

An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments."

The thermodynamics of this transition is embodied by the Hatano-Sasa relation. In this letter, we show that for a slow transition between quantum nonequilibrium steady states the nonadiabatic entropy production is, to leading order, given by the path action with respect to a Riemannian metric in the parameter space which can be connected to the Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov quantum Fisher information. We then demonstrate how to obtain minimally dissipative paths by solving the associated geodesic equation and illustrate the procedure with a simple example of a three-level maser. Furthermore, by identifying the quantum Fisher information with respect to time as a metric in state space, we derive an upper bound on the excess entropy flux that holds for arbitrarily fast processes."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities."

Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\\ell_c$.

The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime."

While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims, while operationalizing feasibility assessment as a temporally-filtered claim verification task using backtesting. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress."

This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude."

We also argue that, under particle/vortex duality, the Halon impurity is exchanged with the $\\pi$-flux vortex line leading to spin-flux duality, a proposal which we test with a detailed matching of symmetries, anomalies, and phases. Finally, we write down quantum lattice Hamiltonians which can be used to test our predictions, and give an argument on the lattice in favor of spin-flux duality."

Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the \"Summary and Future Research\" section of our paper."

This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions characterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its time-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this phenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include environmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects. However, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes and interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under full open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by incorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that DQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle loss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both processes coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we uncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain (loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time behavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These phenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large dynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from non-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are general and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical simulations."

Their performance is ultimately constrained by spin projection noise, yet solid-state implementations have so far been limited by much larger photon shot noise. Here we demonstrate a direct, quantum non-demolition readout of a mesoscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that surpasses the photon shot-noise limit and approaches the intrinsic spin projection noise. By stabilizing the $^{14}$N nuclear spin bath at high magnetic fields and employing repetitive nuclear-assisted spin readout, we achieve a noise reduction of 3.8 dB below the thermal projection noise level. This enables direct access to the intrinsic fluctuations of the spin ensemble, allowing us to directly observe the signatures of correlated spin states. Our results establish projection noise-limited readout as a practical tool for solid-state quantum sensors, opening pathways to quantum-enhanced metrology, direct detection of many-body correlations, and the implementation of spin squeezing in mesoscopic solid-state ensembles."

The two approaches differ by quantum jump terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs -- multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels that serve as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds."

For non-positive chemical potentials, the Lanczos coefficients exhibit linear behaviors with respect to $n$. However, as the chemical potential becomes positive, a dynamical transition occurs -- Lanczos coefficient $b_{n}$ develops a two-stage linear growth profile, transitioning from an initial slope of $\\pi/\\beta$ to the asymptotic slope of $2/\\beta$; while Lanczos coefficient $a_{n}$ shows a deflection from near-zero values to linear descent with slope $-4/\\beta$ where $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature. Moreover, the engineered power spectra are used to study the evolution of the Krylov complexity and some universal behaviors are uncovered -- the single-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum results in the quadratic growth of the complexity, consistent with that from the $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction. Conversely, the double-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum restores the exponential growth of the complexity, satisfying the maximal chaos bound. These results may provide new insights into the profound impact of chemical potential on the operator growth and Krylov complexity in the quantum field theory."

Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter."

However, the theoretical understanding of the interplay between phonon-induced disorder and nonlinear many-body interactions, central to the dynamics of these systems, remains unclear, as incorporating these contributions into direct quantum dynamical simulations is highly challenging. To address this, the authors develop here a mean-field many-body mixed quantum–classical approach, in which the nuclei are propagated quasiclassically while the electronic and photonic degrees of freedom evolve under a nonlinear Schrödinger equation that incorporates many-body effects at the mean-field level. Using this framework, the authors demonstrate that nonlinear interactions and the total number of excitations can be tuned to enhance quantum coherence in light–matter systems and enable enhanced exciton transport in materials placed inside optical cavities.

      "summary": "Applying magnetic flux to manipulate qubits is an important method in superconducting quantum computing, but the state-of-the-art approach based on room-temperature electronics suffers from some unscalable limitations. This work provides an alternative approach in which an rf SQUID serves as an on-chip source of direct current, to provide qubits with in situ , low-noise magnetic flux. Several single-pulse inputs are enough to modulate the source and provide qubits with flux; this can benefit from time-division multiplexing to save on cables and sources. The technique could provide a scalable solution for applying magnetic flux in fault-tolerant quantum computing. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 034057] Published Mon Sep 22, 2025"
