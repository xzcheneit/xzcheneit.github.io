Escribano, Man Suk Song, Hadas Shtrikman, Yuval Oreg, Nurit Avraham, and Haim Beidenkopf Superconductivity is typically induced in semiconductors through high-quality epitaxial interfaces. However, the authors demonstrate here that a robust superconducting state can be spectroscopically observed in semiconducting nanowires simply by mechanically placing them on an indium substrate. A hard superconducting gap is detected on the nanowire’s top facets, up to 100 nanometers from the physical contact with indium. The induced superconductivity exhibits an anisotropic critical field, characteristic of a one-dimensional superconducting state. [Phys. Rev. B 112, 064513] Published Mon Aug 11, 2025"

This study presents a strain-tunable microwave cavity that integrates a piezoactuator-based device with a high-dielectric rutile resonator, enabling precise measurements of low-energy quasiparticle excitations under tunable strain. Applying this technique to an iron-based superconductor allows direct observation of strain-controlled superconductivity via microwave spectroscopy. This powerful probe for quantum materials might also serve as a platform for future applications, such as quantum hybrid systems. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 024025] Published Mon Aug 11, 2025"
