The work discusses an architecture for quantum repeaters, in which information is encoded in error-correcting codes capable of handling both photon loss and logical errors. Advantages of this approach are that it can work with very limited resources at each repeater station, and is more robust to errors than previous techniques. The results can promote long-distance quantum communication at very high rates. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 044090] Published Wed Oct 29, 2025"

QOT has attracted considerable interest and seen substantial development, but has not yet reached its ultimate limit. The authors introduce a unified framework for optimal QOT by mapping the problem to the “clique cover” model from graph theory. This framework provides superlative efficiency and experimental feasibility in measurement strategies. This validation of QOT’s utility paves the way for advanced quantum system characterization and state-property learning. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 044091] Published Wed Oct 29, 2025"
