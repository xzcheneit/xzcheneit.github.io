      "summary": "Swift heavy ion irradiation of single crystals leaves permanent damage trails, ion tracks, that are commonly assumed to be cylindrical with circular cross-sections, a view shaped by the limited resolution of conventional characterization techniques. Using an advanced small-angle x-ray scattering method here, long-standing resolution limits are overcome and ion track cross-sections are probed with Angstrom-level precision. It is found that tracks in single crystals are not circular, but instead exhibit strong, orientation-dependent anisotropy, challenging the conventional assumption and revealing how crystal structure governs track formation.
