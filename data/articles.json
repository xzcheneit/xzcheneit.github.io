They show that for both the easy-axis phase below and the weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin transition temperature, the corrections are concentrated at the Brillouin zone center at low magnon energies, leaving intact the altermagnetic splitting of the magnon modes at higher energies and nonzero crystal momentum. The authors discuss implications for inelastic neutron scattering and magnon transport. [Phys. Rev. B 112, 064425] Published Fri Aug 15, 2025"

      "summary": "An exciton – a bound electron-hole pair – is inert to the Lorentz force due to its charge neutrality. As such, the motion of an exciton cannot be described by the same Landau quantization that characterizes the motion of a free electron or hole in magnetic field. This contrast raises the question: How can a bound exciton state in magnetic field be expressed through the Landau quantization of its electron and hole components? Here, the authors establish a scattering selection rule between the Landau levels { n e , n h } of the electron and hole components, and identify an elegant pairing law between these Landau levels, n e = n h + l . The pairing law provides information on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number l , and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. [Phys.

Such behavior is known to be exceptional in the absence of Dirac excitations. Using a three-loop renormalization group study of the underlying Gross–Neveu–Yukawa quantum field theory, they provide evidence that it is actually prevalent in Dirac materials. [Phys. Rev.
