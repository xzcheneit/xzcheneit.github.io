They also note patterns tied to device geometry and fabrication processes. Their findings provide a method to benchmark exchange crosstalk, and suggest best practices for designing future large-scale devices. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 034051] Published Fri Sep 19, 2025"

The authors show here that negative exchange can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Specifically, the authors find that valley phase difference between dots produce a nontrivial ℤ 2 gauge field in the low-energy theory, which in turn leads to a negative exchange interaction. [Phys.

By tuning excitation wavelength, they control the number of phonons involved in the absorption and energy transfer processes. Larger energy mismatch (e.g., 1064 nm excitation) requires more phonons, resulting in greater thermal enhancement. The temperature-dependent phonon population model explains the observed sensitivity, advancing nanoscale thermometry applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics. [Phys. Rev.

First-principles calculations reveal that strain modifies the electronic structure near the Fermi level, influencing both magnetostriction and damping through spin-conserving transitions. The results reproduce experimental trends across alloy compositions and clarify the role of orbital degeneracy. This intrinsic link between magnetization dynamics and magnetoelasticity suggests routes for designing materials with controllable damping for energy-efficient memory and flexible spintronics. [Phys.

Atom interferometry has long been a candidate for superior inertial sensors, enabling improvements in short-term sensitivity and long-term stability, but realizing this potential requires understanding and mitigation of error sources, particularly in dynamic environments. This study demonstrates suppression of dynamic phase errors via rapid reversal of the direction of inertial sensitivity, at a rate much faster than the measurement bandwidth of the interferometer. The resulting noise resilience should prove useful in field applications of matter-wave interferometers. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 034041] Published Wed Sep 17, 2025"
