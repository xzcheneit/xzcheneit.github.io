Aspects of theoretical findings associated with the nature of magnetism and metallicity, in a diverse set of parameter regimes, are now being actively investigated in triangular Hubbard cold atom and solid-state (moir\\'e) based emulators. Building on the theoretical work of Haerter and Shastry [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,087202 (2005)], we explore the impact of kinetically frustrated magnetism, a phenomenon where antiferromagnetic order emerges without any underlying magnetic interactions, at finite hole density. We numerically study the infinite-$U$ triangular Hubbard model using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm and estimate the extent of stability of the kinetically induced $120^{\\circ}$ antiferromagnetic state to hole doping. Beyond the Haerter-Shastry regime, we find an intermediate phase with multimer (involving multiple correlated spins) stripes that eventually gives way to a paramagnet. We also find evidence of gapless charge excitations (metallicity) throughout the phase diagram for finite hole density. We discuss the implications at large, but finite and realistic values of $U/t$, and investigate whether kinetic magnetism and superexchange collaborate or compete."

      "summary": "Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and in-plane magnetic fields have emerged as natural platforms for realizing both the bulk superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) - phenomena characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions due to the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Using the quasiclassical Eilenberger formalism, we systematically investigate both the bulk SDE and the JDE in a clean NCS with Rashba SOC and in-plane magnetic fields. For the bulk system, we find that the diode efficiency can nominally approach its maximal value at the critical endpoint of the first-order Lifshitz transition between weak and strong helical phases featuring finite-momentum Cooper pairs, the latter marked by the emergence of Bogolyubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs). In a Josephson junction, we show that finite-momentum pairing in the superconducting leads is the dominant mechanism behind the JDE in short junctions, whereas in long junctions it is primarily governed by the Zeeman field in the normal region. In the long-junction regime, the diode efficiency additionally oscillates between positive and negative values as a function of magnetic field at low fields, providing a route toward a highly tunable Josephson diode. At higher fields, the onset of BFSs in the strong helical phase leads to a sharp suppression of both the JDE and the Josephson current when the current direction is aligned with momenta along the BFS, resulting in strong anisotropy. We propose that this anisotropy in the Josephson current offers an alternative method for detecting BFSs, applicable to systems with or without a JDE."

Here we show that their symmetry allows for a switchable ferro-spinetic polarization - the spin analogue of ferroelectricity - in a direction dictated by the lattice symmetry. We demonstrate this effect first in its purest form in an interacting altermagnetic fermion model, in which a many-body chiral symmetry forbids any charge polarization. Our quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal edge-localized, reversible spin accumulations fully consistent with this symmetry locking. Breaking the chiral symmetry releases the charge sector: a ferroelectric polarization emerges orthogonal to the ferro-spinetic one, yielding mutually perpendicular switchable spin- and charge-polarized responses. We identify Mn-based metal-organic frameworks as realistic hosts for this effect, offering a practical route for experimental verification."

When projected into the lowest Landau level with $\\nu = 1$ filling, the topological (Pontryagin) charge density of the magnetization field is proportional to the electric charge density, allowing for long-range spin-spin interactions. Inspired by recent experimental developments that enable all-electrical magnon generation and detection, in this work we theoretically demonstrate two phenomena that can occur due to Coulomb interactions that are unique to QHFMs: magnons can scatter off of point charges at a distance, and skyrmions can act as transmitters and receivers for magnons to be transduced between separate layers of a bilayer QHFM. The latter Coulomb-mediated spin drag effect occurs at arbitrary distance and could facilitate long-range magnonics, such as detection of spin waves for future experiments in 2D materials."

These models are characterized by local gates that preserve the pairwise difference of local operators (e.g. particle number). Such circuits can be de- fined on arbitrary graphs in arbitrary dimensions for both quantum and classical degrees of freedom. A key consequence of the PDC construction is the emergence of an extensive set of loop charges associated with closed walks of even length on the graph. These charges exhibit a one-dimensional character reminiscent of 1-form symmetries and lead to strong Hilbert-space fragmentation. As a case study, we analyze a quasi one-dimensional ladder geometry, where we characterize all dynam- ically disconnected sectors by the loop-charge symmetries, providing a complete decomposition of the Hilbert space. For the ladder geometry, we observe clear signatures of nonergodic dynamics even within the largest symmetry sector."

All the compounds exhibit direct bandgaps with G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE bandgap ranging from 2.42 to 3.02 eV, optimal for efficient light absorption with minimal energy loss. Exciton binding energies (0.258-0.318 eV) indicate moderate Coulomb attraction, favoring exciton dissociation. Employing the Feynman polaron model, we established the polaronic properties, where weak to intermediate carrier-phonon coupling was observed, with polaron mobilities reaching values up to 37.19 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. These properties establish X$_{3}$BI$_{3}$ materials as viable candidates for next-generation optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a >10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials."

The assembly process relies on the weak bonding across interfaces between layered vdW compounds, making it possible to construct exceptionally clean heterostructures from chemically and structurally distinct materials - a challenging task for traditional thin-film growth techniques. Here we demonstrate an additional, dynamic degree of freedom afforded by vdW interfaces, wherein we use microstructured polymer stamps to disassemble and reconfigure vdW heterostructures by sliding. We apply this technique to alter the dielectric environment of monolayer graphene, perform scanning tunneling microscopy on semiconducting and air-sensitive monolayers, and manipulate strain-sensitive moir\\'e materials. Together these demonstrations suggest a new paradigm for assembling and dynamically modifying van der Waals heterostructures, with the potential to reveal new insights into 2D electron systems."

A softening of the acoustic phonon modes is seen in most of the 2D phases, suggesting a tendency to structural distortions or phase transitions under small perturbations. The trigonal 3D Te-I structure is characterized as a narrow-gap semiconductor hosting Weyl nodes at high-symmetry locations in the Brillouin zone, which is supported by the characteristic spin texture seen in momentum space, where spins align radially, forming Berry monopoles. This topological feature, along with the observation of Weyl phonons is attributed to inversion symmetry breaking and strong SOC. Ultrathin Te-h nanowires also exhibit signatures of Weyl nodes and presents a considerable energy gap under SOC. On the other hand, the two-dimensional monolayers $\\alpha$-Te, $\\beta$-Te, are classified as topologically trivial, as indicated by their topological invariants, which arises from the preservation of both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries in these systems. The potential for inducing topological phase transitions via external perturbations suggest that these monolayers are promising candidates for engineered Weyl phases or other topological states. We demonstrate that tellurium and its low-dimensional derivatives are versatile materials that exhibit a broad range of electronic and phononic phenomena intrinsically linked to chirality and symmetry breaking. The tunability of their electronic and topological properties places tellurium as a promising material platform for the exploration and application of Weyl physics in next-generation electronic and optoelectronic technologies."

Here, we demonstrate that inversion-symmetry-broken AM fluctuations generically resolve this competition in favor of spin-triplet pairing. As a proof of concept, we study a minimal two-orbital model with two van Hove singularities. The broken inversion symmetry induces momentum-orbital locking: the same orbital dominates at opposite momenta, enhancing the triplet channel. Crucially, a subdominant fluctuation channel arising from inter-van-Hove nesting provides an internal Josephson coupling that locks the phase difference between triplet pairs on different orbitals. We find this coupling changes sign ($+$ to $-$) upon a crossover from AM-dominant to ferromagnetic-dominant fluctuations. The resulting $\\pi$-phase difference manifests as a $\\tau_z$-type order parameter, $c_{k,1\\uparrow}c_{-k,1\\uparrow} - c_{k,2\\uparrow}c_{-k,2\\uparrow}$. Although intra-orbital in the original basis, its orbital-nontrivial character, as manifested by its equivalence to inter-orbital pairing under rotation, defines a general \\textit{inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity}. This state is distinct from the $\\tau_0$-triplet pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, as evidenced by the canceled intra-orbital supercurrent in a Josephson junction between them."

Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. This machine learning architecture reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed to train it compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts."

      "summary": "We investigate the equilibria of a random model network exhibiting extensive chaos. In this regime, a large number of equilibria is present. They are all saddles with low-dimensional unstable manifolds. Surprisingly, despite network's connectivity being completely random, the equilibria are strongly correlated and, as a result, they occupy a very small region in the phase space. The attractor is inside this region. This geometry explains why the collective states sampled by the dynamics are dominated by correlation effects and, hence, why the chaotic dynamics in these models can be described by a fractionally-small number of collective modes."

      "summary": "We present a unified many-body perturbation theory for open quantum systems, that treats dissipation, correlations, and external driving on equal footing. Using a Keldysh-Lindblad formalism, we introduce diagrammatic treatment of dissipative interaction lines representing quasiparticle flows and fluctuations. Two new Feynman rules render the evaluation of dissipative diagrams compact and systematically improvable, while preserving the Keldysh and anti-Hermitian symmetries of the closed-system theory. Consequently, the structure of the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE) remains unchanged, enabling existing numerical methods to be directly applied. To illustrate this, we derive dissipative versions of the second Born and GW approximations, identifying the physical content of the self-energy components. Moreover, we demonstrate that time-linear approximations to the full KBE retain their closed structure and can be efficiently used to simulate relaxation and decoherence dynamics. This framework establishes a general route toward first-principles modeling of correlated, driven, and dissipative quantum materials."

The spin anomalous Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current produced by a ferromagnetic layer are candidate mechanisms for producing such an out-of-plane anti-damping torque, but both require that the magnetic moment of the spin source layer be canted partly out of the sample plane at zero applied magnetic field. Here we demonstrate such a canted configuration for a ferromagnetic SrRuO3 layer and we characterize all vector components of the torque that it produces, including non-zero out-of-plane anti-damping torques. We verify that the out-of-plane spin component can be tuned by the orientation of magnetic moment, with significant contributions from both the spin anomalous Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current."

      "summary": "The Hopfield associative memory model stores random patterns in synaptic couplings according to Hebb's rule and retrieves them through gradient descent on an energy function. This conventional setting, where neurons are assumed to have monotonic transfer functions, has been central to understanding associative memory. Morita (1993), however, showed that introducing non-monotonic transfer functions can dramatically enhance retrieval performance. While this phenomenon has been qualitatively examined, a full quantitative theory remains elusive due to the difficulty of analysis in the absence of an underlying energy function. In this work, we apply dynamical mean-field theory to the discrete-time synchronous retrieval dynamics of the non-monotonic model, which succeeds in accurately characterizing its macroscopic dynamical properties. We also derive conditions for retrieval states, and clarify their relation to previous studies. Our results provide new insights into the non-equilibrium retrieval dynamics of associative memory models."

However, its photocarrier dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here we report transient absorption spectroscopy of NbOI$_2$ using femtosecond pump probe reflectance measurements. A pronounced transient absorption feature is observed near the 2.34 eV excitonic resonance, arising from photocarrier induced excitonic energy shifts and saturation. The decay dynamics reveal an exciton lifetime of several tens of picoseconds and show density-dependent behavior consistent with exciton exciton annihilation, yielding an annihilation coefficient of 0.09 cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to that in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Polarization resolved measurements further reveal a pronounced in-plane anisotropy in the transient response that follows the linear absorption anisotropy. These findings provide fundamental insight into photocarrier dynamics in NbOI$_2$ and establish key parameters for understanding and exploiting its optoelectronic behavior."

We introduce another magnetic field and map the system to the interacting Kitaev chain. This setup, tunable through the applied fields and the orientation of the spin centers within the crystal, exhibits a variety of rich quantum behavior which notably includes floating phases, a $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking phase, and lines of both Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and Pokrovsky-Talapov transitions. Furthermore, we employ several novel methods to calculate the Luttinger liquid parameter in our model with incommensurate correlations. We find that these methods provide a route to identify BKT transitions with less computational resources than utilizing entanglement entropy and central charge."

This work proposes a distinct class of antiferromagnetic materials, termed X-type antiferromagnets, which are shown to produce more efficient $\\cal T$-odd spin currents than altermagnets along specific crystallographic directions due to their unique Fermi surface geometry. The spin current polarization is controlled by the N\\'eel vector orientation. In the (110)-oriented $\\beta-\\mathrm{Fe}_2\\mathrm{PO}_5$, the Fermi surface exhibits a $d$-wave altermagnetic-like characteristic and becomes compressed into an approximately X-shaped $d$-wave configuration, yielding highly efficient $\\cal T$-odd spin currents with a charge-to-spin conversion efficiency reaching 90%. Moreover, when the N\\'eel vector is tilted via unit cell selection or external means, the system generates out-of-plane spin-polarized currents with efficiencies substantially exceeding those of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices."

SyntheFormer is a positive-unlabeled framework that learns synthesizability directly from crystal structure, combining a Fourier-transformed crystal periodicity (FTCP) representation with hierarchical feature extraction, Random-Forest feature selection, and a compact deep MLP classifier. The model is trained on historical data from 2011 through 2018 and evaluated prospectively on future years from 2019 to 2025, where the positive class constitutes only 1.02 per cent of samples. Under this temporally separated evaluation, SyntheFormer achieves a test area under the ROC curve of 0.735 and, with dual-threshold calibration, attains high-recall screening with 97.6 per cent recall at 94.2 per cent coverage, which minimizes missed opportunities while preserving discriminative power. Crucially, the model recovers experimentally confirmed metastable compounds that lie far from the convex hull and simultaneously assigns low scores to many thermodynamically stable yet unsynthesized candidates, demonstrating that stability alone is insufficient to predict experimental attainability. By aligning structure-aware representation with uncertainty-aware decision rules, SyntheFormer provides a practical route to prioritize synthesis targets and focus laboratory effort on the most promising new inorganic materials."

The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange."

This limitation can be overcome by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and other low-dimensional semiconductors with highly enhanced exciton binding energies. Exciton thermal radiation, which can potentially be exploited for selective thermal emission and energy harvesting, has been recently observed in individual SWCNTs heated under photoirradiation. However, whether macroscale-SWCNT assemblies can emit exciton thermal radiation under conduction heating remains unclear and constitutes an important challenge for practical applications. Herein, we observed peaked exciton thermal radiation from structure-sorted SWCNT membranes. Transmission spectroscopy showed robust exciton resonance at high temperatures, resulting in clear exciton resonance in the thermal radiation band. The absolute emissivity spectra of the membranes were determined at 850 K. Exciton dominance suppresses the contribution of thermal free carriers to the infrared absorption/emission spectra, maintaining the transparency below the optical gap even at elevated temperatures. These phenomena are not observed in bulk semiconductors, highlighting the structure-sorted SWCNT membranes as unique semiconductors leveraging stable exciton resonances at elevated temperatures."

Although extensive research has been conducted on their antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature (N$\\acute{\\textrm{e}}$el temperature, $T_\\textrm{N}$), ferroelectricity, and piezoelectricity, the effects of doping and substitution of rare-earth (RE) elements on these properties remain insufficiently explored. In this study, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed to predict and analyze the physical properties of RECrO$_3$ compounds under various doping scenarios. Experimental and literature data were integrated to train machine learning models, enabling accurate predictions of $T_\\textrm{N}$, besides remanent polarization ($P_\\textrm{r}$) and piezoelectric coefficients ($d_{33}$). The results indicate that doping with specific RE elements significantly impacts $T_\\textrm{N}$, with optimal doping levels identified for enhanced performance. Furthermore, high-entropy RECrO$_3$ compounds were systematically analyzed, demonstrating how the inclusion of multiple RE elements influences magnetic properties. This work establishes a robust framework for predicting and optimizing the properties of RECrO$_3$ materials, offering valuable insights into their potential applications in energy storage and sensor technologies."

This behavior is quantitatively captured by a dissipation model that uses a renormalized two-body scattering matrix. The highest observed dissipation rates approach, but do not reach, the unitarity bound on two-body scattering in the lattice, owing to momentum dispersion. We further measure the temperature dependence of resistivity in the strongly interacting limit and compare it to the predicted asymptotic behaviors.

To investigate its ground-state properties in the intermediate coupling regime which is critical for real materials, we construct a two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model and employ the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method for large-scale simulations. By systematically calculating ground-state pairing correlation functions across parameter spaces, we map its pairing symmetry phase diagram. We find that an increasing Hund's coupling selectively enhances the interlayer $s_{\\pm}$-wave pairing while suppressing the intralayer $d$-wave pairing. Similarly, a larger crystal field splitting drives a transition from $d$-wave- to $s_{\\pm}$-wave-dominant states. Further analysis reveals that the strength of the intralayer $d$-wave pairing is strongly correlated with the $(\\pi, \\pi)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, which are in turn effectively suppressed by a large crystal field splitting, thereby weakening the $d$-wave pairing channel. Additionally, the dominant pairing symmetry transition region roughly overlaps with the inversion of orbital occupancy response to Hubbard $U$, suggesting an intrinsic link between pairing competition and orbital physics. Our results indicate that, within the parameter regime relevant to the actual material, the $s_{\\pm}$-wave is the most probable pairing symmetry."

Here, we investigate theoretically the transition from three-dimensional nematics to a two-dimensional description restricted to a tangent plane, using a mean-field approach. We identify a transition from first to second order isotropic-nematic transition in presence of weak tangential anchoring. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a two-dimensional description of thin nematic shells is relevant. Nonetheless, using the example of active nematic stress, we identify physical differences between two- and three-dimensional descriptions in curved geometry. Finally, we construct a thin film approximation of nematohydrodynamics for a nematic shell in contact with a curved substrate. All together, those results show that a tangential restriction of nematic orientation must be used with care in presence of curvature, activity, or weak anchoring boundary conditions."

      "summary": "Tensor-network renormalization group (TNRG) is an efficient real-space renormalization group method for studying the criticality in both classical and quantum lattice systems. Exploiting symmetries of a system in a TNRG algorithm can simplify the implementation of the algorithm and can help produce correct tensor RG flows. Although a general framework for considering a global on-site symmetry has been established, it is still unclear how to incorporate a lattice symmetry like rotation or reflection in TNRG. As a first step for lattice symmetries, we propose a method to incorporate the lattice-reflection symmetry in the context of a TNRG with entanglement filtering in both two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). To achieve this, we write down a general definition of lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language. Then, we introduce a transposition trick for exploiting and imposing the lattice-reflection symmetry in two basic TNRG operators: projective truncations and entanglement filtering. Using the transposition trick, the detailed algorithms of the TNRG map in both 2D and 3D are laid out, where the lattice-reflection symmetry is preserved and imposed. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct the linearization of the TNRG maps in a given lattice-reflection sector, with the help of which it becomes possible to extract scaling dimensions in each sector separately. Our work paves the way for understanding the lattice-rotation symmetry in TNRG."

      "summary": "The initialization and control of a long-lived spin population in lead halide perovskites are prerequisites for their use in spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate circular polarization of the interlayer exciton emission in a (BA)2PbI4/WSe2 monolayer heterostructure. The helicity of this emission is controlled by tuning the energy of the excitation laser through the manifold of exciton resonances of the WSe2 monolayer, together with an emerging interlayer absorption feature of the heterostructure. Theoretical calculations show that this resonance arises from hybridized (BA)2PbI4/WSe2 states in the valence band. This hybrid character enables its observation in both linear absorption and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopies, and plays a key role in controlling the sign of the helicity of the interlayer exciton emission. The tunable spin polarization demonstrated here, with the WSe2 monolayer effectively acting as a tunable spin filter, represents an important step toward the use of 2D perovskites in opto-spintronic applications."

      "summary": "Large-scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic antenna complexes of the Chlorobium Tepidum green sulfur bacteria (GSB) containing more than one hundred thousand chlorophyll molecules, comparable with natural size, have been performed. Here we have modeled the entire process of the exciton energy transfer, from sunlight absorption to exciton trapping in the reaction centers (RCs) in presence of a thermal bath. The energy transfer has been analyzed using the radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and solving the rate equations for the populations. Sunlight pumping has been modeled as black-body radiation with an attenuation factor that takes the Sun-Earth distance into account. Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes, and the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our analysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB the number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure rate and the internal efficiency shows values close to $\\sim 80\\%$. We also considered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not reflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the transition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case where all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the important case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the light-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the high sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole moments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could drive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices."

We study the RG flow from the decoupled Ising fixed point into the $O(2)$-invariant one and towards the fluctuation induced first order transition. To this end we study the behavior of phenomenological couplings. At the $O(2)$-invariant fixed point we obtain the estimate $Y_4=-0.1118(10)$ of the RG-exponent of the perturbation. Note that the small modulus of $Y_4$ means that the RG flow is slow. Hence, in order to interpret experiments or Monte Carlo simulations of lattice models, which are effectively described by the $\\phi^4$ model with a cubic term, we have to consider the RG flow beyond the neighborhood of the fixed points."

However, the development of highly active photocatalysts is essential to efficiently drive these reactions without harming the environment. In this study, we introduce a strategy that incorporates elements with both low and high electronegativities into catalysts based on transition metals, thereby enhancing both reactant adsorption and charge transfer. This strategy is implemented in a high-entropy oxide (HEO) by adding cesium, an alkali metal with very low electronegativity, and gallium, a metal with high electronegativity, to transition metals titanium, niobium and tantalum. The resulting oxide, TiNbTaGaCsO9 with a large concentration of oxygen vacancies, exhibits strong light absorption, a low bandgap and a suitable band structure for both hydrogen evolution and CO2 conversion. Compared to HEOs with only d0 or d0+d10 cationic configurations, the synthesized oxide with a wide electronegativity difference and mixed d0+d10+s0 cationic configurations shows significantly higher activity for both H2 and CH4 production, even without using a cocatalyst. These results demonstrate a design strategy for creating highly active HEOs containing alkali metals by taking advantage of the electronegativity mismatch across the periodic table."

By establishing design rules for multifarious self-assembly while budgeting the energy input required to drive these non-equilibrium transitions, we demonstrate that these systems can execute a wide variety of tasks including counting, computing modulo functions, and recognizing specific input patterns.

We implement this algorithm in our open-source C++ template library, Physica. Combining the improved algorithm with state-of-the-art software engineering, our implementation achieves high performance and numerical stability. As an example, we demonstrate that for the $4 \\times 4$ Hubbard model, our method runs approximately $10^3$ times faster than $\\mathcal{H}\\Phi$ 3.5.2. Moreover, the accessible temperature range is extended down to $\\beta = 32$ across arbitrary doping levels.

      "summary": "Hilbert space fragmentation, as it is currently investigated, primarily originates from specific kinematic constraints or emergent conservation laws in many-body systems with translation invariance. It leads to non-ergodic dynamics and possible breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that also in disordered systems, such as the XXZ model with random on-site fields, fragmentation appears as a natural concept offering fresh perspectives, for example, on many-body delocalization (MBdL). Specifically, we split the Fock-space into subspaces, potential-energy shells, which contain the accessible phase space for the relaxation of a quenched initial state. In this construction, dynamical observables reflect properties of the shell geometry, e.g., the drastic sample-to-sample fluctuations observed in the weak disorder regime, $WW_c$, the potential-energy shell decays into fragments; we argue that, unlike percolation, fragmentation is a strong-coupling scenario with turn-around flow: $W_c(L)$ diverges with increasing system size. We conjecture that the slowing down of the relaxation dynamics reported in traditional MBdL studies is (essentially) a manifestation of Fock-space fragmentation introduced here."

Simultaneously, we analyze the effects of the interlayer Coulomb interaction potential on the physical properties of the considered system. We demonstrate that the application of planar electric fields leads to the formation of an unusually large bandgap in the electronic band structure, which is not typical for AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We discuss various values of the applied electric field potentials and show their influence on the electronic band structure of the system. Additionally, we identify the existence of a critical value of the magnetic field above which Wigner crystallization-like effect is present for the electrons, also affecting the excitonic gap in one spin channel.

We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance. Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size without hyperparameter tuning.

The measured thermal Hall conductivity ($\\kappa_{xy}$) is two orders of magnitude higher than what is expected by electronic carriers according to the electrical Hall conductivity and the Wiedemann-Franz law, yielding a record Hall Lorenz number of $164.9\\times10^{-8}V^2 K^{-2}$ ($\\sim$67$L_0$) - the largest ever observed in a metal. The temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity significantly differs from its longitudinal counterpart, ruling out a purely phononic origin of the non-electronic component.

During time evolution, the soliton pattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We further study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk can induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking time-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of two spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the confined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev.

      "summary": "Valley, as a ubiquitous degree of freedom in lattices, has found wide applications in both electronic and classical-wave devices in recent years. However, achieving valley-polarized states, a prerequisite for valley-based operations, still remains challenging. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a universal non-Hermitian mechanism for valley filtering using only uniform background dissipation, which creates a propagation length contrast between valleys through their intrinsic group velocity differences. We implement this concept in an acoustic crystal, observing switchable and robust valley polarization of sound through large-scale field mapping. Remarkably, our approach is solely based on uniform loss, without the need for any special lattice structures, tailored excitations, or external fields. We further provide designs of our non-Hermitian valley filter on photonic and electronic platforms. Our results offer a simple and effective solution to valley-polarized state generation and may advance the development of novel valley-based devices in both classical and quantum regimes."

      "summary": "Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers with an interlayer twist exhibit a moire super-period, whose effects can manifest in both structural and electronic properties. Atomic displacements can lead to reconstruction into domains of aligned stacking, and flat bands can form that may host correlated electron states. In heterobilayers angular mismatch is nearly unavoidable, so understanding the consequences of an interlayer twist is essential. Using ab initio density functional theory, we find that in near-60 degree twisted MoSe2/WSe2 bilayers valence and conduction band flat bands emerge at ~3 degree twist. Despite relatively limited reconstruction at these angles, atomic displacement creates a polarization gradient that forms a confining potential, localizing and laterally separating electrons and holes within the moire supercell. Excitons formed from flat band electrons and holes should therefore have not only the out-of-plane dipole moment familiar from MoSe2/WSe2 interlayer excitons, but an in-plane dipole moment as well."

      "summary": "The symmetry-broken correlated states in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) can be tuned via several external knobs, including twist angle, displacement field, and carrier density. However, a direct, momentum-resolved characterization of how these parameters reshape the flat-band structure remains limited. In this study, we employ micro focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the flat-band dispersion of TDBG at a twist angle of 1.6, systematically varying the displacement field and carrier density via electrostatic gating. We directly observe multiple flat moir'e minibands near charge neutrality, including a flat remote valence band residing below the low-energy flat-band manifold. Furthermore, the dominant Coulomb repulsive energy over the flat- band bandwidth suggests favorable conditions for the emergence of interaction-driven correlated phenomena in TDBG. These findings establish that the formation and evolution of flat bands in TDBG arises from the interplay between the electron filling and the displacement field."

A single tunable gap, $\\hbar|\\omega_{eff}|$ with $\\omega_{eff}=\\omega_{c}+\\omega_{cl}$, organizes all equilibrium observables obtained from a compact harmonic-oscillator partition function: free energy, internal energy, entropy, heat capacity, magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and magnetocaloric responses collapse onto universal hyperbolic kernels in $x=\\hbar|\\omega_{eff}|/(2k_{B}T)$. We identify a compensated-field regime where the transverse gap closes and the heat capacity reaches an equipartition plateau, providing a sharp signature of magnetoelastic interference. In transport and torque, the same scale rigidly shifts the Hall fan and compresses the $1/B$ period of de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations when expressed in $1/B_{eff}$, enabling a phase-unwarping protocol that metrologizes the dislocation density from a single field sweep. In mesoscopic samples, boundary corrections to the Landau degeneracy generate finite-size calorimetric oscillations that diagnose the effective magnetic length. Moderate disorder and weak interactions preserve the kernel structure while smoothing amplitudes. We outline an experimental roadmap combining on-chip calorimetry, torque magnetometry, and transport, and discuss device-level opportunities in caloritronics and strain engineering, magnetocaloric microcooling, magnetoelastic heat switching, and dilatometric transduction, where the single scale $\\hbar|\\omega_{eff}|$ enables rational design and optimization."

      "summary": "This research establishes a systematic, high-throughput computational framework for designing radiation-resistant, dilute ternary copper-based alloys by addition of solutes that bind to vacancies and reduce their mobility, thus promoting interstitial-vacancy recombination. The first challenge in developing alloys by this method is mitigating the vacancy-mediated solute drag effect, since density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that solutes that bind strongly to vacancies are also rapidly dragged to point-defect sinks, and thus removed from the matrix. To overcome this issue, two types of solutes are added to the Cu matrix: A first solute with a strong vacancy binding energy (B-type species) and another solute that binds to 'B' and is a slow diffuser in Cu (C-type species). Using DFT, 21 synergistic solute pairs are screened, with 'B'=Zr, Ge, Sn and 'C'=Fe, Co, Mo, Ni, Nb, W, Cr. Two promising alloys, Cu(Zr,Co) and Cu(Zr,Fe) are then investigated in detail in the dilute regime. Diffusion and solute drag in these alloys are modeled using the kinetic cluster expansion approach (KineCluE) under irradiation conditions. It is shown that strong Zr-'C' thermodynamic binding, especially between Zr and Co, significantly reduces the mobility of Zr solute and suppresses the vacancy-mediated solute drag. Using an analytical framework for the standard five-jump frequency model for diffusion in binary alloys, it is found that vacancy-Zr-Co triplets disrupt the kinetic circuits that promote solute drag in the binary alloy by raising the dissociation barrier for the vacancy from the solute."

With it, we show how deterministic phase locking and stochastic phase slips can be continuously tuned by varying the relative amplitudes and frequencies of the driving components. Using, as an example, a spin-torque nano-oscillator, we numerically validate this theory by implementing a deterministic Ising machine paradigm, a probabilistic one, and dual-mode operation of the two. This demonstration introduces the concept of adaptive Ising machines (AIM), a unified oscillator-based architecture that dynamically combines both regimes within the same hardware platform by properly tuning the amplitudes of the bi-harmonic driving relative to the noise strength. Benchmarking on different classes of combinatorial optimization problems, the AIM exhibits complementary performance compared to oscillator based Ising machines and probabilistic Ising machines, with adaptability to the specific problem class. This work introduces the first OIM capable of transitioning between deterministic and probabilistic computation taking advantage of a proper design of the trade-off between the strength of phase-locking of an auto-oscillator to a bi harmonic external driving and noise, opening a path toward scalable, CMOS compatible hardware for hybrid optimization and inference."

      "summary": "Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns, particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information, multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering, automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion, peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully self-driving materials discovery."

It is well known that the hydrodynamics of such integrable models can be understood by viewing the system as a gas of quasiparticles. Here, we explore the dynamics of individual quasiparticles for a variety of initial conditions of the background gas. The mean, variance, and two-time correlations are computed exactly and lead to a picture of quasiparticles as drifting Brownian particles. For the case of a homogeneous background, we show that the motion of two tagged quasiparticles is strongly correlated, and they move like a rigid rod at late times. Apart from a microscopic derivation based on the mapping to point particles, we provide an alternate derivation which emphasizes that quasiparticle fluctuations are related to initial phase-space fluctuations, which are carried over in time by Euler scale dynamics. For the homogeneous state, we use the Brownian motion picture to develop a Dean-Kawasaki-type fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, formally having the same structure as that derived recently by Ferrari and Olla. We discuss differences with existing proposals on the hydrodynamics of hard rods and some puzzles."

      "summary": "We show that rolling a two-dimensional altermagnet into a nanotube turns it into a spin-programmable chiral nanosolenoid with two reciprocal, SOC-free functionalities. (i) Direct: injecting a single-spin-polarized current produces a steady helical current whose handedness is locked to the spin orientation, yielding opposite axial magnetic fields for opposite spins. (ii) Inverse: a time-varying axial flux Phi(t) induces a circumferential Faraday field E_theta = -(dPhi/dt)/(2 pi R) that drives equal-magnitude, opposite-sign axial charge currents in the two spin channels, Iz^up = - Iz^down, thereby pumping a pure spin current Is = (hbar/2e)(Iz^up - Iz^down) with zero net charge flow. Both effects arise from the interplay between momentum-odd spin polarization inherent to altermagnets and the screw symmetry of the rolled geometry, and persist in the complete absence of spin-orbit coupling. Using V2Se2O as a prototype, first-principles calculations reveal spin-dependent chiral wave functions near both the conduction- and valence-band edges. These results establish a nonrelativistic route toward compact spin-controlled flux generators and charge-neutral spin injectors in light-element materials without static magnetic bias."

However, Hall measurements often show strong temperature dependence caused by extrinsic scattering, complicating quantitative analysis, and temperature invariance of the Kerr effect remains unconfirmed. Here we employ epitaxial, stoichiometric Mn3NiN single crystal films and perform polar Kerr measurements at an infrared 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength, demonstrating a spontaneous Kerr signal that remains stable within a few percent across a 200 Kelvin range below the N\\'eel temperature. This temperature-invariant Kerr effect contrasts with the strongly temperature-dependent Hall effect and confirms the intrinsic nature of Berry curvature in these materials. Our findings establish infrared Kerr effect as a reliable, local probe of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets, facilitating quantitative characterization and advancing antiferromagnetic spintronic applications."

In particular, spectroscopic measurements under pressure remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we functionalized the diamond anvil cell technique for point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy (PCAR) measurement on thin-flake materials under pressure, offering the opportunity to obtain spectroscopic information on superconductivity. To validate the feasibility of this method, we have conducted PCAR measurements on iron-selenide thin flakes to extract temperature-dependent superconducting gap values under ambient and high pressure. Combine with the proven magnetotransport capability, our method provides a conceptually simple tool for a detailed examination of thin-flake superconductors under pressure."

      "summary": "Nonlinearities and instabilities in mechanical structures have shown great promise for embedding advanced functionalities. However, simulating structures subject to nonlinearities can be challenging due to the complexity of their behavior, such as large shape changes, effect of pre-tension, negative stiffness and instabilities. While traditional finite element analysis is capable of simulating a specific nonlinear structure quantitatively, it can be costly and cumbersome to use due to the high number of degrees of freedom involved. We propose a framework to facilitate the exploration of highly nonlinear structures under quasistatic conditions. In our framework, models are simplified by introducing `flexels', elements capable of intrinsically representing the complex mechanical responses of compound structures. By extending the concept of nonlinear springs, flexels can be characterized by multi-valued response curves, and model various mechanical deformations, interactions and stimuli, e.g., stretching, bending, contact, pneumatic actuation, and cable-driven actuation. We demonstrate that the versatility of the formulation allows to model and simulate, with just a few elements, complex mechanical systems such as pre-stressed tensegrities, tape spring mechanisms, interaction of buckled beams and pneumatic soft gripper actuated using a metafluid. With the implementation of the framework in an easy-to-use Python library, we believe that the flexel formulation will provide a useful modeling approach for understanding and designing nonlinear mechanical structures."

      "summary": "Transport properties are central to characterizing quantum matter, yet their extraction typically requires external forcing and time-resolved measurements. In this work, we propose a scheme to access transport coefficients directly from measurements of local, static ground-state currents -- quantities readily accessible in quantum-engineered platforms. By exploiting the exponential decay of correlations in gapped systems and the finite velocity of correlation spreading, we demonstrate that the local Hall response can be reconstructed from a small set of quasi-local current observables. We derive explicit relations connecting these static observables to a practical local Chern marker, and introduce a scalable digital protocol for measuring the required generalized currents in cold-atom quantum simulators. Numerical simulations of a non-interacting Chern insulator validate our approach. Moreover, the scheme extends naturally to fractional Chern insulators and other strongly correlated systems, even at finite temperature, offering a broadly applicable route to probing transport in engineered quantum matter."

      "summary": "Charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity coexist in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Cs, Rb), raising fundamental questions about the mechanisms driving their intertwined phases. Here we combine high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering with first-principles calculations to uncover the origin of CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Guided by structure factor analysis, we identify a soft phonon mode along the reciprocal M-L direction, with the strongest effect at the L point, where the elastic scattering intensity also grows most rapidly upon cooling. First-principles calculations incorporating lattice anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling reproduce these observations and establish a soft-mode instability at the L point as the driving mechanism of CDW formation. Despite the weakly first-order character of the transition, our results unambiguously demonstrate that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates from a softened phonon, clarifying its microscopic origin and highlighting the central role of lattice dynamics in kagome metals."

First-principles calculations confirm its energetic, dynamical and thermal stability (up to at least 1000 K). Regarding its band structure, this material exhibits a semimetallic nature. It exhibits high mechanical compliance, with a Young's modulus approximately 13 times lower and a Poisson's ratio nearly 4 times higher than those of graphene. The optical response is marked by strong ultraviolet absorption, high infrared reflectivity, and pronounced transparency in the visible-light range. Raman and infrared spectra exhibit sharp and well-separated peaks, providing a clear signature of acetylenic linkage stretching vibrations. Nanoribbon structures derived from HXGY show distinct electronic behaviors depending on the edge termination type and width. These findings highlight the HXGY potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications."

Understanding the properties of and the convergence towards infinite-time (nonequilibrium) steady states however remains a challenging endeavor. We propose a physically motivated Krylov space perspective on Floquet thermalization which offers a natural framework to study rates of convergence towards steady states and, simultaneously, an efficient numerical algorithm to evaluate infinite-time averages of observables within the diagonal ensemble. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the periodically driven mixed-field Ising model, reaching system sizes of up to 30 spins. Our method successfully resolves the transition between the ergodic and dynamically frozen phases and provides insight into the nature of the Floquet eigenstates across the phase diagram. Furthermore, we show that the long-time behavior is encoded within the localization properties of the Ritz vectors under the Floquet evolution, providing an accurate diagnostic of ergodicity."

      "summary": "Accurate prediction of atomistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties from molecular structures underpins materials innovation. Existing computational and experimental approaches lack the scalability required to efficiently navigate chemical space. Scientific foundation models trained on large unlabeled datasets offer a path toward exploring chemical space across diverse application domains. Here we develop MIST, a family of molecular foundation models with up to an order of magnitude more parameters and data than prior works. Trained using a novel tokenization scheme that comprehensively captures nuclear, electronic, and geometric information, MIST learns from a diverse range of molecules. MIST models have been fine-tuned to predict more than 400 structure -- property relationships and match or exceed state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and quantum chemistry. We demonstrate the ability of these models to solve real-world problems across chemical space, including multiobjective electrolyte solvent screening, olfactory perception mapping, isotope half-life prediction, stereochemical reasoning for chiral organometallic compounds, and binary and multi-component mixture property prediction. Probing MIST models using mechanistic interpretability methods reveals identifiable patterns and trends not explicitly present in the training data, suggesting that the models learn generalizable scientific concepts. We formulate hyperparameter-penalized Bayesian neural scaling laws and use them to reduce the computational cost of model development by an order of magnitude. The methods and findings presented here represent a significant step toward accelerating materials discovery, design, and optimization using foundation models and provide valuable guidance for training compute-optimal scientific foundation models."

Low-energy effective descriptions of the dynamics must be consistent with this microscopic analyticity constraint. We consider two canonical low-energy fermionic Green's functions describing non-Fermi liquids, the marginal Fermi liquid and the `Hertz liquid'. The pole in these Green's functions must be outside of the Lieb-Robinson domain of analyticity for all complex momenta captured by the low-energy theory. We show that this constraint upper bounds the magnitude of the dimensionless non-Fermi liquid coupling in certain Hertz liquids. We furthermore obtain, from causality, an upper bound on the magnitude $|G^R(\\omega,{\\bf k})|$ within the analytic domain. We use this bound to constrain the quasiparticle residue of the non-Fermi liquids."

These patterns often follow power- law distributions in inter-event intervals or event rates. Existing models typically capture only one of these features and rely on non-local memory, which complicates analysis and mechanistic interpretation. We introduce a novel self-reinforcing point process whose event rates are governed by local, Markovian nonlinear dynamics and post-event resets. The model generates power-law tails for both inter-event intervals and event rates over a broad range of exponents observed empirically across natural and human phenomena. Compared to non-local models such as Hawkes processes, our approach is mechanistically simpler, highly analytically tractable, and also easier to simulate. We provide methods for model fitting and validation, establishing this framework as a versatile foundation for the study of bursty phenomena."

      "summary": "Modern mechanical sensors increasingly measure motion with precision sufficient to resolve the fundamental thermal noise floor over a broad band. Compared to traditional sensors -- achieving this limit only near resonance -- this capability provides massive gains in acquisition rates along with access to otherwise obscured transient signals. However, these stronger measurements of motion are naturally accompanied by increased back-action. Here we show how resolving the broadband thermal noise spectrum reveals back-action-induced correlations in the noise from many mechanical modes, even those well-separated in frequency. As a result, the observed spectra can deviate significantly from predictions of the usual single-mode and (uncorrelated) multimode models over the broad band, notably even at the mechanical resonance peaks. This highlights that these effects must be considered in all systems exhibiting measurement back-action, regardless of whether the resonances are spectrally isolated or the readout noise is high enough that the noise peaks appear consistent with simpler models. Additionally, these correlations advantageously allow the thermal noise spectrum to reach a minimum -- equivalent to that of a single mode -- in a band far from the resonance peak, where the mechanical susceptibility is comparatively stable against frequency noise."

This challenge becomes especially apparent in molecular-level particle simulations, where high spatial and temporal resolution leads to rapidly increasing computational demands. To overcome these limitations, hybrid methods that combine simulations with different levels of resolution offer a promising solution. In this context, we present a machine learning-based decision model that dynamically selects between simulation methods at runtime. The model is built around a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) that predicts the expected discrepancy between particle and continuum simulation results, enabling the localized use of high-fidelity particle simulations only where they are expected to add value. This concurrent approach is applied to the simulation of membrane fabrication processes, where a particle simulation is coupled with a continuum model. This article describes the architecture of the decision model and its integration into the simulation workflow, enabling efficient, scalable, and adaptive multiscale simulations."

      "summary": "When aiming for atomic resolution electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in STEM mode, the high convergence angle of the electron probe can lead to unforeseen artefacts and strong reductions of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the measurement of magnetic magnitudes. In this work, the EMCD signal is measured in STEM mode at semi-convergence angles ranging from \\alpha=\\ 2-10\\ mrad\\ using iron samples with high structural perfection. We observe that the relative EMCD signal remains very similar for all convergence angles, which is in good agreement with simulations. The improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio as compared to earlier works is due to better crystalline quality of the Fe sample, high control of the sample orientation, better control over sample thickness, and factors such as higher beam current and the use of a fast and sensitive hybrid-pixel electron detector. One of the key factors to remove experimental ambivalences is the use of an acquisition geometry where the two conjugate EMCD spectra are acquired simultaneously. Furthermore the high crystalline quality Fe sample enables the acquisition of statistical entities of spectra at the same sample orientation, which in turn results in high SNR EMCD signals. We obtain high SNR EMCD signals for all semi convergence angles and could measure the orbital to spin magnetic moment ratio ml/ms with high precision. We observed that at high convergence angles, the ml/ms ratio gets sensitive to minute changes in sample orientation."

Our approach combines real-space sampling of tensor-network-bridged quantum circuits with symmetric subspace measurements, effectively constraining the wavefunction within a substaintially reduced Hilbert space for efficient and scalable simulations of versatile target states. The system is partitioned into equal-sized subsystems, where quantum circuits capture local entanglement and tensor networks reconnect them to recover global correlations, thereby overcoming partition-induced limitations. Symmetric subspace measurements exploit point-group symmetries through a many-to-one mapping that aggregates equivalent real-space configurations into a single symmetric state, effectively enhancing real-space bipartition entanglement while elimilating redundant degrees of freedom. The tensor network further extends this connectivity across circuits, restoring global entanglement and correlation, while simultaneously enabling generative sampling for efficient optimization. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to the periodic $J_1\\!-\\!J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, incorporating translation, reflection, and inversion symmetries. With a small matrix product state bond dimension of up to 6, the method achieves an absolute energy error of $10^{-5}$ for a 64-site periodic chain and a $6\\times6$ torus after bond-dimension extrapolation. These results validate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid eigensolver and demonstrate its strong potential for scalable quantum simulations of strongly correlated systems."

      "summary": "We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer."

Numerous numerical experiments have shown that the energy dissipation holds when calculating the ground states of multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates (MBECs) with GFSI, while rigorous proof remains an open challenge. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, we reformulate the GFSI into an equivalent form and thereby prove the energy dissipation for GFSI in two-component scenario with Josephson junction and rotating term, which is one of the most important and topical model in MBECs. Based on this, we further establish the global convergence to stationary states. Also, the numerical results of energy dissipation in practical experiments corroborate our rigorous mathematical proof, and we numerically verified the upper bound of time step that guarantees energy dissipation is indeed related to the strength of particle interactions."

We apply the Krylov subspace method for Hamiltonian deformations, which provides a systematic way of constructing solvable models from known instances. In doing so, we relate the evolution of deformed and undeformed theories and investigate their complexity. For a certain class of deformations, the resulting Krylov subspace is unchanged, and we observe time evolutions with a reorganized basis. The tridiagonal form of the generator in the Krylov space is maintained, and we obtain generalized Toda equations as a function of the deformation parameters. The imaginary-time-like evolutions can be described by real-time unitary ones. As possible applications, we discuss coherent Gibbs states for thermodynamic systems, for which we analyze the survival probability, spread complexity, Krylov entropy, and associated time-averaged quantities. We further discuss the statistical properties of random matrices and supersymmetric systems for quadratic deformations."

      "summary": "Continuous monitoring of one-dimensional free fermionic systems can generate phenomena reminiscent of quantum criticality, such as logarithmic entanglement growth, algebraic correlations, and emergent conformal invariance, but in a nonequilibrium setting. However, whether these signatures reflect a genuine phase of nonequilibrium quantum matter or persist only over finite length scales is an active area of research. We address this question in a free fermionic chain subject to continuous monitoring of lattice-site occupations. An unraveling phase $\\varphi$ interpolates between measurement schemes, corresponding to different stochastic unravelings of the same Lindblad master equation: For $\\varphi = 0$, measurements disentangle lattice sites, while for $\\varphi = \\pi/2$ they act as unitary random noise, yielding volume-law steady-state entanglement. Using replica Keldysh field theory, we obtain a nonlinear sigma model describing the long-wavelength physics. This analysis shows that for $0 \\leq \\varphi < \\pi/2$, entanglement ultimately obeys an area law, but only beyond the exponentially large scale $\\ln(l_{\\varphi,*}) \\sim J/[\\gamma \\cos(\\varphi)]$, where $J$ is the hopping amplitude and $\\gamma$ the measurement rate. Resolving $l_{\\varphi, *}$ in numerical simulations is difficult for $\\gamma/J \\to 0$ or $\\varphi \\to \\pi/2$. However, the theory also predicts that critical-like behavior appears below a crossover scale that grows only algebraically in $J/\\gamma$, making it numerically accessible. Our simulations confirm these predictions, establishing the absence of measurement- or unraveling-induced entanglement transitions in this model."

However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control these materials' electronic properties."

In two-fluid systems, wetting and the balance of capillary and viscous forces control fluid displacement processes, leading to a wide range of complex flow regimes with rich spatio-temporal dynamics. Macroscopic two-phase flow is historically described through the phenomenological extensions of Darcy's law. Besides many other shortcomings and inconsistencies, it covers only connected pathway flow in the capillary-dominated flow regime in a rigorous manner while other flow regimes with moving interfaces and associated topological changes are entirely implicit. Given the lack of adequate descriptions, upscaling multiphase flow from pore to Darcy scale represents a long-standing challenge paving into the fields of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and integral geometry. In this review, we compare novel concepts which have been largely motivated by experimental insights, enabled by significant advances in pore-scale imaging and modeling over the last decade."

Conventional superconducting components lack directionality, causing energy loss and decoherence. Superconducting diodes, that allow dissipationless current in one direction and resistive flow in the other, offer a potential remedy, yet their efficiency and quantum integration remain limited. Here, we realize a quantum diode in twisted NbSe2 bilayers under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A mere 1 degree twist yields an efficiency enhancement over pristine devices, reaching 27.6 percent. Quantum simulations reveal that this intermediate efficiency, well below 100 percent ideal, is both experimentally practical and optimal for preserving qubit anharmonicity and stabilizing two-level systems. These findings show that maximal rectification is not always beneficial for quantum information, establishing a new principle for designing the fundamental properties of twisted superconductors towards low-power, high-fidelity quantum circuits."

      "summary": "Chiral active fluids consist of self-spinning particles that rotate as a result of a continuous injection of energy on the microscopic scale (e.g., by activity or an external field). The hydrodynamics of such fluids is described by antisymmetric contributions in the viscosity tensor -called odd viscosity-, which are allowed by symmetry due to the presence of a non-trivial spin angular momentum density. By generalising the Helmholtz minimum dissipation theorem to systems with odd viscosity, we show that incompressible three-dimensional odd fluids in the presence of sources that induce flow (e.g. surfaces that impose boundary conditions) admit a unique solution for their steady flow fields at low Reynolds number. Furthermore, we prove that such flows dissipate more energy than ordinary Stokes flow, provided that the flow field is affected by odd viscosity. As an example, we consider a model fluid described by one shear viscosity and one odd viscosity in the creeping flow regime. We explicitly compute the stress tensor when such a fluid is subjected to a point force density. Finally, we compute exact results for the pressure and flow fields around a translating and rotating spherical particle from their singularity representations. From these solutions and our extended Helmholtz theorem, we explain why a translating sphere dissipates more energy when odd viscosity is present, whereas a rotating sphere does not."

This work investigates the origins of morphological non-uniformity in micro-pyramids and micro-platelets grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). We observe that a direct one-step growth approach leads to significant growth rate inhomogeneity across arrays. To shed light on this issue, we examine the mechanisms driving non-uniformity and explore process modifications aimed at mitigating these effects. Building on these insights, we propose a controlled multi-step growth strategy that combines sequen-tial growth and thermal treatment phases. This approach is demonstrated to enhance surface morphology and structural regularity. The work contributes to the broader objective of enabling scalable, high-precision GaN microstructure fabrication for next-generation optoelectronic applications."

We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its ideal-operation value, despite finite-time challenges. Finally, for lower values of the orbital angular momentum, we describe an alternate scheme for operating quantum heat engines based on the adiabatic elimination of a mechanical mode. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as an experimentally-accessible control knob that can reconfigure the performance of such quantum heat engines as desired."

We demonstrate how the winding number of the vortex, its spatial configuration, and the shape of the superconducting lead can steer the sign and amplitude of the supercurrent rectification. We identify a general criterion for optimizing the rectification amplitude based on vortex patterns, focusing on configurations where the first harmonic of the supercurrent vanishes.

Here, we report the discovery of long-range ordered periodic dipole arrays of atomic-scale vortices and antivortices in the unconventional charge-density-wave (CDW) phase of BaTiS3, a quasi-1D chalcogenide. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals the presence of a multi-q ordering in BaTiS3 that confines vortex-vortex-antivortex polarisation triplets to the a-b plane with alternating handedness along the c-axis. The multi-q displacive distortions are characterised by three distinctive off-centre TiS6 configurations, whose ratios are independently confirmed by 47/49Ti solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR). Using first-principles calculations and phenomenological modelling, we show that the dipolar vortex unit cell in BaTiS3 arises from the coupling between multiple lattice instabilities arising from flat, soft phonon bands. This mechanism contrasts with classical dipolar textures in ferroelectric heterostructures that emerge from the competition between electrostatic and strain energies. The observation of dipolar vortices in BaTiS3 brings the ultimate scaling limit for real-space dipolar topological structures down to about a nanometre and unveils the intimate connection between crystal symmetry and real-space topology. Our work sets up zero-filling semiconducting materials with competing structural instabilities as a playground for realising and understanding quantum polarisation topologies."

A prominent example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where subsystem symmetry is restored more rapidly under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. In this work, we investigate symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems for a range of initial states. We show that symmetry can still be restored in the many-body localization regime without approaching thermal equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quantum Mpemba effect emerges universally for any tilted product state, in contrast to chaotic systems where its occurrence depends sensitively on the choice of the initial state. We further provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect using an effective model for many-body localization. Overall, this paper fills an important gap in establishing a unified understanding of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in generic many-body systems, and it advances our understanding of many-body localization."

The key challenges limiting their full potential are (1) high-quality epitaxial thin-film growth and (2) the understanding of Berry curvature domain physics.

Combining multiple experiments supported by theoretical calculations, we probe the Berry curvature associated with antiferromagnetic {\\Gamma}4g domains in Mn3NiN and its strong connection to an AHE. We directly image the intrinsic Berry curvature with high-resolution Sagnac microscopy, controlling spatial distribution and dynamics by varying temperature and applied magnetic fields. We discover that the {\\Gamma}4g domains are switchable near the N\\'eel transition, but become frozen and unresponsive to external stimuli at low temperature. This behavior enables the tuning of Berry-curvature driven AHE and magneto-optic Kerr effect responses through controlled experimental conditions. Our findings provide critical advancement of the fundamental understanding and wide tunability of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets important for realization in potential spintronic applications."

      "summary": "Topological defects occurring in nonlinear classical field theories are described by a system of second-order differential equations. A breakthrough was made in 1976 by E. B. Bogomoln'yi who demonstrated that in several field theories these equations can be reduced to first-order provided the coupling constants take on particular values. One of the examples involved a string in the Abelian Higgs model which is equivalent to the Abrikosov flux line of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. In a similar vein, in the 1966 textbook Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys P. G. de Gennes explained how to reduce the second-order Ginzburg-Landau equations to first-order at a particular value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter by a method due to G. Sarma. We analyze the two ways of arriving at the first-order Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations and conclude that while they both rely on the same operator identity, Sarma's method is free of the assumption that there is a topological defect. The implication is that Bogomol'nyi equations found in other field theories may be a source of a wider range of solutions beyond topological defects."

      "summary": "Single-crystalline diamond (SCD) films possess exceptional thermal, chemical, and optical properties, making them ideal for advanced applications. However, achieving uniform film quality via microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) remains challenging due to spatial variations in plasma characteristics. This study systematically examines the influence of microwave power and chamber pressure on the growth of SCD films using CH4/H2 gas mixtures. Under optimized conditions (3,900 W, 120 Torr), the films exhibit low surface roughness (~2.0 nm), a sharp sp3 Raman peak at 1,332.2 cm-1, and no detectable C-H related features, indicating high crystalline purity. Cross-sectional TEM analysis confirms a uniform (100)-oriented single-crystal structure across the entire sample. These findings advance the understanding of the interplay between deposition parameters and film quality, and establish a more robust foundation for optimizing MPCVD processes in large-area, high-purity diamond fabrication."

      "summary": "In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed ''deep boundary criticality''. Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies."

The self-consistent calculation on the three-leg Kadanoff-Baym contour is fully self-contained, employing only QTT-compressed functions and input functions which are either generated directly in QTT form or obtained via quantics tensor cross interpolation."

      "summary": "This work presents a multi-level modeling and design framework for weft knitted fabrics, beginning with a volumetric finite element analysis capturing their mechanical behavior from fundamental principles. Incorporating yarn-level data, it accurately predicts stress-strain responses, reducing the need for extensive physical testing. A simplified strain energy approach homogenizes the results into three key variables, enabling rapid, accurate predictions in minutes. After validation against experiments, our framework can simulate new knit fabrics without additional tests. In real-world scenarios, fabrics often feature variations in yarn materials or patterns. The framework extends to heterogeneous fabrics, showing that transitions between distinct regions can be captured using simple mechanical analogies: springs in series and parallel. This allows heterogeneous textiles to be treated as idealized patchworks of homogeneous pieces, preserving predictive accuracy. The method is demonstrated by designing and producing a compression sleeve with uniform pressure, illustrating how the framework supports development of knits tailored to specific assistance levels and anatomical features. By combining volumetric finite element analysis, simplified model through homogenization, and controlled material transitions, this approach provides a scalable, high-fidelity path toward next-generation weft knitted fabric design."

Our investigation shows that models with extended hopping provide a correct representation of magnetic interactions only in a hypothetical square CuO$_2$ layer, where the diagonal superexchange interaction with the next-nearest neighbors always has the AFM nature. The conclusions are based on the symmetry prohibition on FM contribution to the diagonal superexchange between the next-nearest neighbors for a simple square CuO$_2$ layer rather than for a real CuO$_2$ layer, where diagonal AFM superexchange may be overestimated. We also discuss the reasons for magnetic frustration effects and high sensitivity of spin nanoinhomogeneity to square symmetry breaking."

The Rashba spin-orbit interaction that affects the spins of electrons tunneling through the weak links changes their momentum concomitantly. We establish the connection between the magnetization flux induced by processes that conserve the momentum and the magnetization created by tunneling events that do not. Control of the induced magnetization can be achieved by tuning the polarization of the AC electric field responsible for the spin-orbit Rashba interaction (e.g., from being circular to linear), by changing the applied bias voltage, and by varying the degree of a gate voltage-induced asymmetry of the device."

By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts."

The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics."

First-principles calculations and the Boltzmann transport formalism reveal a complex interplay of multi-phonon scattering processes, where flexural phonons and four-phonon interactions play a significant role in heat transport, primarily dominated by acoustic phonons. Notably, the four-phonon interactions are predominantly confined to acoustic phonons. Tensile strain preserves the underlying scattering mechanisms while reducing anharmonicity, consequently, the scattering rates, enhancing thermal conduction. Simultaneously, competing modifications in thermal and electrical transport shape the strain-dependent thermoelectric response, achieving a figure of merit approaching 1 at elevated temperatures, a testament to its thermoelectric promise. Our findings underscore the critical role of microscopic transport modeling in accurately capturing thermal and thermoelectric properties, paving the way for advanced applications of 2D materials."

By mapping the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution and analyzing their autocorrelations, we extract the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter, independent of global phase coherence. Our results reveal that a finite local CDW amplitude is already established well above the transition temperature. When the system is cooled below the transition temperature down to 20 K, the correlation length extends to nearly 110 nm, and the local CDW amplitude is found to strongly anticorrelate with the local strain field."

However, controlling this process has been mostly a trial-and-error process, being costly in both time and money. The recent advance of high heating rate sintering methods, which promise higher energy efficiency and better properties, only adds to this. This paper aims to reduce these costs by shedding light on the microstructural evolution during high heating rate sintering, which will allow for quicker parameter optimization and improved properties. The focus will be on how a representative microstructure changes locally as well as globally while resolving grains and the green body at scale, which no prior paper has done. A representative multiphysics phase-field solver is employed, incorporating a novel particle-based temperature model, which recovered many characteristics typical of high heating rate sintering. Comparing the simulation data to experimental data showed reasonable agreement over a large density range without parameter adjustment. Furthermore, the advance of a sintering front including grain growth effects could be shown simulatively for the first time in literature. These findings suggest that the model can be used for the design of practical heating schedules for the sintering of novel materials."

      "summary": "Locally noncentrosymmetric materials are attracting significant attention due to the unique phenomena associated with sublattice degrees of freedom. The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has emerged as a compelling example of this class, garnering widespread interest for its remarkable temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram, which features a field-induced first-order superconductor-to-superconductor phase transition with nontrivial dependence on the field direction and high critical fields, as well as antiferromagnetic and potentially higher multipole orders. To investigate the complex interplay of the ordered phases in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, we develop a theoretical framework based on symmetry analysis combined with Bogoliubov--de Gennes and Landau methods. This approach allows us to propose probable symmetries of the superconducting states and elucidate their close relationship with magnetism. Among other results, we find that the near degeneracy of two pairing symmetries is naturally explained if and only if intralayer spin-orbit coupling is large compared to interlayer hopping. Intriguingly, we find that the first-order transition can be interpreted as a transition between coexistence phases of the same superconducting order parameters, albeit with distinct admixtures. This line may end in a critical endpoint below the superconducting critical temperature. Our approach accurately reproduces current experimental phase diagrams for varying temperature as well as out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic field, both if the transition to a magnetic phase occurs below the superconducting critical temperature and if it occurs above. Furthermore, we calculate the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat and compare these quantities to recent experimental results."

      "summary": "The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity, is common in multicomponent polymer systems. Although often attributed to differences in the intrinsic dynamics of each component, the molecular origin of their coupling and its dependencies remain unclear. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations of polyethylene oxide (PEO)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blends, across the full range of compositions and multiple thermal regimes, to characterize local fluctuations and sub-chain relaxations for both PEO and PMMA. By constructing probability distributions of local composition and computing entropic measures, we connect nanoscale heterogeneity to differences in mobility between PEO and PMMA, extending beyond mean-field treatments. While PMMA segmental fluctuations in blends broadly align with $T_\\text{g}$-equivalent neat PMMA systems, PEO exhibits enhanced mobility correlated with increased free volume and broader, more diverse local compositions upon blending. Rouse-mode analysis, used to probe relaxation dynamics over different length scales, shows that PEO relaxation approaches neat-like behavior in PEO-rich domains, whereas PMMA relaxation accelerates uniformly across all mode numbers. Given the local mobility enhancement of PMMA by PEO, this uniform shift suggests a nanoscale facilitation process that extends PEO's influence beyond its immediate environment. These findings link the statistics of local compositional heterogeneity to dynamic asymmetry across length scales, provide physical insight into the behavior of this archetypal blend system, and establish a framework for analyzing dynamic coupling in others."

      "summary": "A new type of magnet called $p$-wave unconventional magnet is proposed, stimulated by the discovery of altermagnet. We study the tunneling conductance of $p$-wave unconventional magnet/superconductor junctions by adopting the effective Hamiltonian of $p$-wave unconventional magnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking, suggested in Ref [arXiv: 2309.01607 (2024)]. The tunneling conductance shows an asymmetric behavior with respect to bias voltage in the helical $p$-wave superconductor junctions. It is caused by the missing of helical edge states contributing to the charge conductance owing to the momentum-dependent spin-split feature of the Fermi surface in $p$-wave unconventional magnets. In chiral $d$ and $p$-wave superconductor junctions, the resulting spin-resolved tunneling conductance takes a different value for spin sectors due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors. Our results qualitatively reproduce the results based on the simplified Hamiltonian in Ref [J.\\ Phys.\\ Soc.\\ Jpn.\\ \\textbf{93}, 114703 (2024)], where only the odd function of the exchange coupling of $p$-wave unconventional magnets is taken into account, which gives the shift of the Fermi surface and preserves the time-reversal symmetry similar to the spin-orbit coupling."

Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics."

      "summary": "High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a $\\gamma$ pocket -- a hole pocket with $d_{z^2}$-orbital character centered at the Brillouin zone corner. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming channels for the leading $s_\\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge, provided the maximum energy level of the $\\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping."

In this work, we address this question by demonstrating the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model incorporating next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we uncover that NNN interaction parameters can induce fractional topological phases|even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes."

      "summary": "Understanding how granular materials behave in low gravity is crucial for planetary science and space exploration. It can also help us understand granular phenomena usually hidden by gravity. On Earth, gravity dominates granular behavior, but disentangling its role from intrinsic particle interactions is challenging. We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments."

However, several experiments point to shortcomings of this theory, as the distribution of ions surrounding colloids is governed by nontrivial correlations in regimes of strong Coulomb coupling (e.g. low temperature, low dielectric constant, high ion valency, high surface charge). Insight can be gained by explicitly including the ions in simulations of these colloidal suspensions, even though direct simulations of dispersions of highly charged spheres are computationally demanding. To circumvent slow equilibration, we employ a machine-learning (ML) framework to generate density-dependent ML potentials that accurately describe the effective colloid interactions at given system parameters. These ML potentials enable fast simulations and make large-scale simulations of charged colloids in suspension possible, opening the possibility for a systematic study of their phase behaviour, in particular gas-liquid and fluid-solid coexistence."

While this relativistic regime has been achieved in crystalline ferrimagnets, they cannot be routinely integrated in devices. To enable technological breakthroughs, relativistic dynamics must be demonstrated in easy-to-integrate ferrimagnets such as rare-earth -- transition-metal alloys. However, this scenario remains elusive due to the inherent magnetic disorder of these materials, complex spin-wave spectra, and challenges in modeling their ultrafast dynamics. Here, we demonstrate relativistic domain wall motion in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdFeCo devices operated in the proximity of the angular momentum compensation point. The current-induced domain wall velocity saturates within 10% of the spin-wave speed of 2 km/s, a behavior consistent with relativistic model of domain wall motion. Our observation of relativistic dynamics in technologically relevant ferrimagnets opens the way to magnetic devices operating at the ultimate speed limit."

For simulating various properties of multi-component alloys, the cluster expansion (CE) technique has served as the standard workaround to improve computational efficiency. However, the standard CE technique is difficult to extend to exotic and/or low-symmetry lattices, often implemented via iteration over particular cluster types, which must be enumerated per lattice structure. In this work, we introduce the tensor cluster expansion (TCE), implemented in the open-source code tce-lib, which maps correlation functions to mixed tensor contractions, eliminating the need to iterate over cluster types and additionally making the calculation of correlation functions well-suited for massively parallel architectures like GPUs. We show that local interaction energies are an immediate consequence of the TCE formalism, yielding nearly $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ energy difference calculations. We then use this formalism to fit CE models for the TaW and CoNiCrFeMn systems, and use these models to respectively compute the enthalpy of mixing curve and Cowley short-range order parameters, showing excellent agreement with ground truth data."

However, due to the rapid scaling of Hilbert space with the linear size of such a three dimensional system, the nature of its ground state in the thermodynamic limit remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed powerful algorithm to perform large scale unrestricted variational optimization of the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH from the resonating valence bond(RVB) theory perspective. We find a candidate ground state of the system that features a maximally resonating valence bond crystal(VBC) pattern with $2\\vec{a}_{1}\\times2\\vec{a}_{2}\\times2\\vec{a}_{3}$ periodicity. There are at least four levels of hierarchical structure in such a VBC state, with the first and the second level of hierarchy related to the breaking of the inversion and the translational symmetry. Intriguingly, we find that within the RVB framework such a maximally resonating VBC state is almost degenerate with a recently proposed VBC state that is obtained from dressing hard hexagon covering of the pyrochlore lattice, although they have very different structures. We also find that further symmetry breaking will occur in the dressed hard hexagon VBC state under unrestricted optimization, which results in strong disparity in $\\langle \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^{2}_{u} \\rangle$ for up and down tetrahedrons as we observe in the maximally resonating VBC state. We show that the maximally resonating VBC state found here will be favored by a tiny next-neighboring exchange coupling."

Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible."

This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands."

Here, we study a strongly disordered nuclear spin ensemble, using local measurements enabled by the disordered-state technique. We observe an apparent phase transition into a sub-diffusive regime, which we model as a random walk on the emergent fractal structure of a percolating network in the dipolar spin ensemble. Our novel theoretical model provides a framework for characterizing the emergence of thermalization in closed quantum systems, even in the presence of strong disorder."

      "summary": "In recent years the Rosenzweig--Porter (RP) ensemble, obtained by adding a diagonal matrix with independent and identically distributed elements to a Gaussian random matrix, has been widely used as a minimal model for the emergence of fractal eigenstates in complex many-body systems. A key open question concerns the robustness of its phase diagram when the assumption of independent and uncorrelated entries is relaxed -- an assumption that simplifies its analysis, but is generally violated in realistic quantum systems. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by considering a deformed Wishart (rather than Gaussian) random matrix, which we dub the ``Wishart--RP'' ensemble. Using perturbation theory, as well as the cavity and replica methods and the Dyson Brownian motion approach, we characterize its phase diagram and localization properties. Remarkably, we show that the level compressibility, which quantifies spectral correlations in the fractal phase, coincides with that of the Gaussian RP model, thereby extending the universality conjectured in [SciPost Phys. 14, 110 (2023)] beyond the fully uncorrelated setting. We confirm our results with numerical tests."

They are of interest for applications ranging from thermal barrier coatings to catalysts and magnetic materials. At least four REOPs phases were experimentally identified with RE/P ratios from 7:3 to 6:1, however the structures were solved only for 3:1 phases (RE3O3(PO4)). In this work we report the structure for the 7:3 phases (RE7O6(PO4)3) derived by ab initio analysis of models based on previously reported oxide-vanadate analogues. The most stable structures for all 7:3 REOPs were found to be isotypic, adopting monoclinic symmetry with space group P21/c. The structures were validated by comparison of their powder X-ray diffraction patterns to those of synthesized La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd and Tb 7:3 phases (Rietveld refinement for all except Tb). Ab initio analysis of thermodynamic stability showed that all 7:3 REOPs are unstable at 0 K toward decomposition to REPO4 and RE3PO7 or RE2O3. The entropy contribution stabilizes RE7O6(PO4)3 phases for light rare earth elements above 1000 K, however, starting with Dy, computationally predicted stabilization temperature is higher than estimated melting points of RE7O6(PO4)3, which is consistent with observed synthesis pattern."

      "summary": "The Meissner effect, the expulsion of magnetic field from the interior of a metal entering the superconducting state, is arguably the most fundamental property of superconductors, discovered in 1933. The conventional theory of superconductivity developed in 1957 is generally believed to fully explain the Meissner effect. We will review the arguments that support this consensus, rooted in the concept of emergence. However, recent work has shown that there are questions related to momentum conservation in the process of magnetic field expulsion that have not been addressed within the conventional theory. Within a reductionist approach, it has been proposed that those questions can only be resolved by introducing physics that is not part of the conventional theory, namely that there is radial motion of electric charge in the transition process. This is consistent with the behavior of classical plasmas, where motion of magnetic field lines is always associated with motion of charges. We review how this approach explains puzzles associated with momentum transfer between electrons and ions in the Meissner effect. Whether or not radial charge motion is associated with the Meissner effect has fundamental implications regarding superconductivity mechanisms in materials and regarding strategies to search for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures. Therefore, adjudication of this question is urgent and important."

We here theoretically investigate the effective coupling between chirality and axiality at their domain boundaries, mediated by polarity. Based on symmetry considerations and model analyses, we propose the concept of chirality-induced axiality via surface polarization, which refers to a phenomenon where the handedness of chirality selects an axial moment with a particular orientation by lowering its energy at the surface. We further establish the inverse process, termed axiality-induced chirality via surface polarization, whereby axiality in turn dictates the preferred chirality. These reciprocal couplings open a new pathway for stabilizing single-domain states of chirality and axiality. They further imply interfacial functionalities, including the selective adsorption of chiral and axial molecules."

In a theoretical model capturing the essential physics of Dirac electrons in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. By using experimental Fermi velocities of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, our results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$."

Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory."

DIMOS easily integrates machine-learning-based interatomic potentials and implements classical force fields including an efficient implementation of particle-mesh Ewald. Thanks to its modularity, both classical and machine-learning-based approaches can be easily combined into a hybrid description of the system (ML/MM). By supporting key molecular dynamics features such as efficient neighborlists and constraint algorithms for larger time steps, the framework makes steps in bridging the gap between hand-optimized simulation engines and the flexibility of a \\verb|PyTorch| implementation. We show that due to improved linear instead of quadratic scaling as function of system size DIMOS is able to obtain speed-up factors of up to $170\\times$ for classical force field simulations against another fully differentiable simulation framework. The advantage of differentiability is demonstrated by an end-to-end optimization of the proposal distribution in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). Using these optimized simulation parameters a $3\\times$ acceleration is observed in comparison to ad-hoc chosen simulation parameters.

Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Additionally, our autonomous refrigerators with negative temperature baths significantly outperform previously studied autonomous and non-autonomous refrigerators in terms of cooling ability without requiring any additional energy resources, as they cool the cold bath to much lower temperature, which is forbidden for others refrigerators. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms."

However, their heterogeneous and unpredictable in vivo behaviour remains a critical barrier preventing the development of standardized therapeutic approaches for skeletal tissue regeneration. Several studies have attempted to identify in vitro features that could correlate with the in vivo differentiation properties, yet the mechanisms ruling BMSC heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Here, using time-lapse imaging, we lineage-trace 32 single-cell-derived BMSC colonies through seven generations. We observe significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneity in lineage topology (determined by the number of senescent or apoptotic cells) and in replicative kinetics (measured from proliferating cells only). Interestingly, topology and kinetics result strongly correlated, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors linking the non-dividing/apoptotic subpopulations with proliferating cells. Furthermore, BMSCs display highly synchronized cell cycles during early generations, indicating stage-specific regulatory mechanisms through which cells influence each other. By employing a non-interacting population growth model, we demonstrate that the observed synchronisation cannot be explained by an uncorrelated branching process; instead, cell-to-cell correlation of division times must exist. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms governing BMSC heterogeneity and growth dynamics that may inform strategies to control their regenerative potential."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The Fe pressure-temperature phase diagram and its melting line have a wide range of applications, including providing constraints for iron-core planetary models. We propose an equation of state (EOS) model based on the interstitial theory of simple condensed matter (ITCM), as suggested by A.V. Granato. When applied to Fe, this model enables the extrapolation of measured melting lines to the conditions of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB). The ITCM describes the solid-liquid phase transition in metals as resulting from a strong structural perturbation due to a high concentration of interstitial-like defects. The strong nonlinearity of their self-interaction causes the stabilization of this interstitial-rich phase. The original model is expanded to describe melting over a wide range of pressures and temperatures rather than focusing on a specific isobaric transition. Using this model, we fit the measured melting data, extrapolate it to cover ICB conditions, and develop a multiphase equation of state that encompasses this regime. The model is used to explain contradictory data regarding the location of the melting line, resulting from a novel phase transition between two separate liquid phases, specifically between FCC-based and HCP-based liquids. This additional liquid phase offers a new interpretation of the previously suggested near-melting high-pressure phase and may also provide a solution to the inner core nucleation paradox."

The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side."

Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding."

We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage."

      "summary": "The authors uncover here a universal functional form governing anticoncentration, which quantifies how broadly the output probabilities of a random quantum circuit are distributed, across architectures, depths, and even finite system sizes. Using analytical models and extensive simulations, they show that these distributions are characterized by just two parameters. Their results highlight finite-size and finite-depth effects and provide a practical framework for benchmarking quantum devices, enabling validation of much larger systems than previously possible.
