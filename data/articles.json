      "summary": "One key challenge for efficiency and safety in fusion devices is the retention of tritium (T) in plasma-facing components. Tritium retention generates radioactive concerns and decreases the amount of fuel available to generate power. Hence, understanding the behavior of T in tungsten (W), as the main candidate as armor material, is critical to the deployment of fusion as a reliable energy source. In this work, we have studied the effect of a thermal gradient in the transport properties of hydrogen (as a T surrogate) in pure W. Strong thermal gradients develop in the divertor as a result of the intense energy fluxes arriving at the material. We have developed an analytical approach to compute the heat of transport ($Q^*$) that is parameterized from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. $Q^*$ is a parameter needed in irreversible thermodynamics frameworks to understand mass transport in the presence of thermal gradients. We show that $Q^*$ can be written as a function of temperature, temperature gradient, a characteristic length and the ratio of the rates towards hot and cold regions. Furthermore, we describe how, to first order, the dependence of $Q^*$ on the thermal gradient vanishes, in agreement with MD results. On average, we find $Q^*=-5.41\\times 10^{-3}kT^2~\\text{eV}$ for H in pure W, with $k$ the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature."

      "summary": "We explore a class of dynamical protocols - that we term loop quenches - which are tailored for the study of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) systems. In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus evading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium topology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we introduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes the equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for chiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe measurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question. Our protocol uncovers a direct dynamical signature of SPT phases and, most importantly, paves the way for a general diagnostic framework that can be extended to other symmetry classes and dimensions."

As the two species represent birds and air, this reactive collision mimics birds flapping their wings, allowing for their propulsion. We demand microscopic reversibility of the reactive collisions. We then introduce a chemostat to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition."

      "summary": "The energy landscape for soft sphere packings exists in a high-dimensional space and plays host to an astronomical number of local minima in a hierarchical and ultrametric arrangement. Each point in the landscape is a configuration that can be unambiguously mapped to its inherent state, defined as the local minimum that the configuration will flow to under perfectly overdamped continuous dynamics. Typically, discrete in time dynamics are used to computationally find local minima, but it is not known whether these algorithms are capable of reliably finding inherent states. Here, we use steepest descent dynamics to find the distribution of the largest time step, $\\delta_\\textrm{best}$, which finds the inherent state. We find that for systems of $N$ particles, $\\delta_\\textrm{best}$ is approximately proportional to $N^{-3}$, and weakly dependent on d and $\\varphi$. We argue that the proportionality is due to saddle points in the energy landscape. Our results suggest that it is impossible, in practice, to reliably find inherent states for systems of about 64 particles or more."

      "summary": "The geometry of bending-active kirigami arches, decorated by cuts and holes, is strongly influenced by the location and geometry of the perforations. This study demonstrates that, in some instances, the geometric stiffening induced by additional cuts can outweigh the weakening effect of material removal, leading to a counterintuitive increase in structural rigidity under a given concentrated load. We present multiple parametric cut patterns to show that rigidity can be increased both under symmetric and asymmetric loads. While the preferred cut location is often near the point of action of the load, asymmetric loading can shift this optimum elsewhere. Moreover, the distance between the supports also plays a crucial role, namely, the rigidity gain vanishes when the supports are too far apart. We found that the rigidity can be increased for both non-perforated and perforated sheets, and there is a non-monotonic relationship between the global porosity and the rigidity of the structure. Numerical predictions are validated against experimental measurements."

      "summary": "We report Coulomb drag studies in an electron-hole bilayer graphene heterostructure in a magnetic field, where the orbital, spin, and valley degrees of freedom are lifted by the combined effects of exchange interaction, Zeeman energy, and vertical displacement field. Our device enables the application of a large vertical displacement field in both layers. In addition to the well-established strong Coulomb drag between Landau levels with an orbital quantum number N = 0, we observe a Coulomb drag signal between the N = 1 Landau levels under a suitable vertical displacement field. As the displacement field increases further, the Coulomb drag signal between N = 1 Landau levels weakens, and a Coulomb drag signal emerges between the N = 0 and N = 1 Landau levels. These findings suggest the important roles of the orbital index and vertical displacement field in interlayer Coulomb interactions within the quantum Hall regime of coupled bilayer systems."

      "summary": "With the growing demand for sustainable and decentralized energy solutions, thermoelectric energy harvesting has emerged as a promising technology for directly converting waste heat into electricity through solid state, environmentally friendly means. Among copper chalcogenides, Cu2Te is a notable p-type material due to its degenerate semiconducting nature and low thermal conductivity. In this study, we present a sustainable synthesis strategy for Sn-doped Cu2Te referred to as bronze telluride (BT) via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) assisted tellurization process using pre-alloyed Cu Sn (bronze) powder. The resulting BT exhibited an enhanced thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 1 at 500 K. To assess practical applicability, BT was integrated with n type galena (PbS) in a cascaded p n thermoelectric module, which generated 2.8 mV across a temperature gradient of 35 K, demonstrating its potential for medium- to high-temperature waste heat recovery. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations and density functional theory (DFT) simulations provided insights into the formation mechanism of Cu2Te and the thermoelectric behaviour of BT. This work introduces an efficient, scalable, and environmentally responsible pathway for developing copper-based thermoelectric materials using industrially relevant precursors."

Antiferrons could be a promising candidate for developing electrical sensing devices, offering tunable, dynamically controllable excitations with high sensitivity to external electric fields."

We then extend the Sequence of Physical Processes (SPP)\\cite{Rogers2017} into a statistical and geometrical framework that fingerprints the nonlinear rheological response of biopolymer composite gels. Our analysis is based on the changes in the shape of the time-dependent Cole-Cole plots that allow to reduce the time resolved analysis of the SPP method into the transition between linear and nonlinear behavior as the rheological parameters are varied. While the results clearly highlight how the mechanical responses of individual constituents are not simply additive, our extended SPP analysis provides a robust and intuitive classification scheme for comparing the nonlinear response of composite materials subjected to large oscillatory strain."

To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices."

A key finding is the differential response of these orders to photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200 $\\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to approximately 70 K.

We demonstrate that the Hall conductivities are almost half quantized and well approximated by the formula $\\sigma _{xy}=\\pm (e^{2}/2h)$ sgn$\\left( J\\sin N_{X}\\Phi \\right) $, where $J$ is the coefficient of the coupling between the $X$-wave magnet and the electrons, and $\\Phi $ is the direction of the applied magnetic field. Hence, the Hall conductivity has the periodicity with respect to $\\Phi $, and the periodicity is equal to the number $N_{X}$ of the nodes. This property may be used to confirm that the target material is indeed an $X$-wave magnet. Furthermore, the sign of $J$ may be used as a bit for antiferromagnetic spintronics."

      "summary": "We use charge sensing to detect entropy changes in a double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gating of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. This system can be tuned to be two separate systems, like two independent, artificial atoms, or a single coherent system, like a molecule. We study entropy changes in both regimes due to changes in the occupation of the system. First we recover the single-dot result for each dot, that the occupation of the dot by a single electron corresponds to an increase in the entropy of $k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log 2$. Next we examine two different charge transitions in the \"molecular\" regime, and how it reveals itself in terms of the measured entropy. We also uncover a realization of Pauli blockade that clutters the entropy signal. By applying a rate equation model, we demonstrate the effect's nonequilibrium origins and exclude it from the analysis of the system's entropy. Understanding these experiments in this simplest coupled system enables the study of the entropy in other, more complicated coupled quantum systems, such as ones with topological or highly entangled ground states."

      "summary": "In the last decade, the study of pressure in active matter has attracted growing attention due to its fundamental relevance to nonequilibrium statistical physics. Active matter systems are composed of particles that consume energy to sustain persistent motion, which are inherently far from equilibrium. These particles can exhibit complex behaviors, including motility-induced phase separation, density-dependent clustering, and anomalous stress distributions, motivating the introduction of active swim stress and swim pressure. Unlike in passive fluids, pressure in active systems emerges from momentum flux originated from swim force rather than equilibrium conservative interactions, offering a distinct perspective for understanding their mechanical response. Simple models of active Brownian particles (ABPs) have been employed in theoretical and simulation studies across both dilute and dense regimes, revealing that pressure is a state function and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on density. Together with nonequilibrium statistical concepts such as effective temperature and effective adhesion, pressure offers important insight for understanding behaviors in active matter such as sedimentation equilibrium and motility induced phase separation. Extensions of ABPs models beyond their simplest form have underscored the fragility of pressure-based equation of state, which can break down under factors such as density-dependent velocity, torque, complex boundary geometries and interactions. Building on these developments, this review provides a comprehensive survey of theoretical and experimental advances, with particular emphasis on the microscopic origins of active pressure and the mechanisms underlying the breakdown of the equation of state."

      "summary": "Transition-metal (TM) atom-functionalized nanomaterials are promising candidates for hydrogen storage due to their ability to adsorb multiple hydrogen molecules through Kubas interactions. However, achieving efficient hydrogen desorption at ambient conditions remains a critical challenge for practical use. Here, we present a novel approach to modulate the desorption temperature of hydrogen in TM-intercalated bilayer graphene (BLG) using external mechanical forces. By employing first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamic occupancy probability calculations, we demonstrate that adjusting the interlayer distance allows for precise control over the interaction energy of H2, thereby facilitating its desorption at ambient conditions. Complete hydrogen desorption occurs when the interlayer distance is reduced below 4.7 {\\AA}, 5.3 {\\AA}, and 5.1 {\\AA} for Sc-, Ti-, and V-intercalated BLG, respectively. Our findings suggest that external mechanical forces can effectively bring hydrogen occupancy to zero by minimizing charge transfer from the TM d-orbitals to H2 antibonding orbitals. Notably, while the total charge transferred from the TM atoms remains nearly constant at varying interlayer distances, its redistribution between the graphene layers and H2 fine-tunes the interaction strength. This approach can be extended to large interlayer distances, as supported by recent experiments on graphene oxide membranes [ACS Nano 12, 9309 (2018)]. Furthermore, recent experimental advances in noble gas and alkali metal intercalation in BLG highlight the potential of this approach to overcome the long-standing challenge of high desorption temperatures in TM-functionalized layered nanomaterials."

      "summary": "Electron-deficient boron clusters are identified as a fundamentally new class of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, entirely free of transition metals. Selective sodium extraction from NaAlB14 and Na2B29 via high-pressure diffusion control introduces hole doping into B12 icosahedral frameworks, resulting in OER activity exceeding that of Co3O4 by more than an order of magnitude, and exceptional durability under alkaline conditions. B12 clusters are known for their superchaotropic character, which destabilizes hydrogen bonding in water. In this system, H2O, instead of OH-, preferentially adsorbs on the catalyst surface, suggesting a distinct OER pathway mediated by molecular water. This adsorption behavior contrasts with conventional transition-metal oxides and reflects the unique interfacial properties of the boron clusters. Density functional theory reveals unoccupied p orbitals and unique local electric fields at the cluster surface, both of which could promote the water activation. These findings suggest a paradigm shift in OER catalysis, in which the unique interaction between B12 clusters and water drives the reaction, replacing the conventional role of redox-active metals. Hole-doped boron clusters thus offer a promising platform for designing high-performance and durable water-splitting catalysts, opening new avenues for OER design beyond conventional transition-metal chemistry."

      "summary": "Borides are a rich material family. To push the boundaries of borides' properties and applications into broader fields, we have conducted systematic theoretical and experimental searches for synthesizable phases in ternary borides TM$_2$B$_2$ (T = 3d, M = 4d/5d transition metals). We find that TM$_2$B$_2$ in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type and CoW$_2$B$_2$-type structures form a large family of stable/metastable materials of 120 members. Among them, we identify 40 materials with stable magnetic solutions. Further, we discover 11 altermagnets in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type structure. So far, boride altermagnets are rare. In these altermagnets, T = Fe or Mn atoms are arranged in parallel T-chains with strong ferromagnetic intrachain couplings and antiferromagnetic interchain couplings. They simultaneously exhibit electronic band spin splitting, typical of ferromagnetism, and zero net magnetization, typical of antiferromagnetism. They also exhibit magnonic band chiral splitting. Both effects originate from the unique altermagnetic symmetries crucially constrained by the nonmagnetic atoms in the structure. Transport properties of relevance to spintronic applications, including the strain-induced spin-splitter effect and anomalous Hall effect, are predicted. An iodine-assisted synthesis method for TM$_2$B$_2$ is developed, using which 7 of the predicted low-energy phases are experimentally synthesized and characterized, including 4 altermagnets. This work expands the realm of borides by offering new opportunities for studying altermagnetism and altermagnons in borides. It also provides valuable insights into the discovery and design of altermagnets. By demonstrating that altermagnets can exist as families sharing a common motif, this work paves a feasible route for discovering altermagnets by elemental substitutions and high-throughput computations."

We formulate the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and develop a self-consistent method to calculate the superconducting order parameter and the resulting supercurrent. Applying this framework to a toy model with Fermi surfaces located near the Brillouin zone corners, we demonstrate a phase discontinuity at the twisted interface, indicating that a Josephson junction is formed purely by the twist. Our calculations reveal that the interface supports a finite critical current even when the Fermi surfaces of the two superconductors are completely separated, unlike in the case of a twisted normal-metal interface. We further show that the critical current can be effectively controlled by the twist angle, transitioning from a high-transparency regime at small angles to a low-transparency regime at larger angles."

      "summary": "Fine-tuning the functional properties of nanomaterials is crucial for technological applications. Superlattices, characterized by periodic repetitions of two or more materials in different dimensions, have emerged as a promising area of investigation. We present a study of the phonon interference effect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp interfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity measurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice nanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a minimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to room temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from coherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed by surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is also observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab initio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculations. These findings provide insights into the wave-like and particle-like transport of phonons in superlattice nanowires and demonstrate the potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the superlattice structure."

Here, a novel approach is developed, which allows to project a broad range of oxygen chemical potentials onto a single thin film sample with unprecedented control via electrochemical polarization. Therefore, a specifically designed electrochemical cell geometry is deployed, resulting in a well-defined, linear, 1D in-plane oxygen concentration gradient, independent of variations in the materials electrical resistivity, whose endpoints can be flexibly controlled via the external pO2 and applied overpotential. This allows for an unparalleled study of materials properties as a continuous function of the oxygen content using spatially resolved tools (spectroscopic, diffraction, microscopy, local electrical probes, etc.) and thereby greatly reduces experimental efforts while also avoiding sample-to-sample variability, multi-step treatments, sample evolution effects, etc. This work presents the proof-of-concept of in-plane oxygen gradients, based on spatially resolved ex/in situ and novel fixed-energy X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), X-ray diffraction, ellipsometry and electrical resistivity measurements in hyper-stoichiometric La2NiO4+{\\delta} and sub-stoichiometric (La,Sr)FeO3-{\\delta} thin films.

Herein, we demonstrate how various biphasic systems can be formed according to the nature of the phase-forming components. Moreover, by employing polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEPEG), previously unrecognized in this context, we reveal the versatility of nonionic polymers for ATPE, which can successfully act as phase-forming compounds, partitioning modulators, and dispersing agents. Interestingly, as proven by experiments and modelling, PEPEG exhibited chirality-sensitive preference toward SWCNTs, which can significantly facilitate the purification of SWCNTs using various approaches. Capitalizing on this finding, we report how the extraction environment may be tailored to promote the isolation of (8,3) SWCNTs and other chirality-enriched SWCNT fractions. The relationships noted, based on the examination of a model material (SWCNTs), provide substantial insight into the elusive mechanism of the ATPE purification approach, widely employed across a range of analytes, from cell organelles to nanostructures"

Many types of surfactants are often added to biphasic systems to enhance the extraction of analytes between phases. Although their role in this process is crucial, it is not entirely understood.

In contrast, for one-dimensional interfaces with long-range elasticity, as well as for short-range interactions in both 1D and 2D, the coexistence regime is absent. Nevertheless, the avalanche statistics differ significantly from those of overdamped systems: the usual power-law distribution is replaced by a pronounced bump, associated with large, anomalous avalanches that expand ballistically.

In contrast to previous theories of polariton-mediated superconductivity, which typically require multiple semiconductor layers, we show that superconductivity can be induced within a single semiconductor monolayer with inverted conduction bands, such as in the tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides. The key ingredient is that we can resonantly excite exciton polaritons into bands that are different from those occupied by the doped electrons, thus avoiding any Pauli blocking effects. Crucially, we can exploit the trion fine structure (i.e., multiple exciton-electron bound states) and tune the electron-polariton interactions via Feshbach resonances. Our theory of polariton-mediated superconductivity includes the energy dependence of the polariton-mediated interactions between electrons, as well as the polariton-induced changes to the electron quasiparticles. We find that superconductivity at elevated temperatures is within reach of current experiments."

      "summary": "Electronic metadevices leveraging sub-wavelength metallic features have shown great potential for high-frequency switching. Theoretical analysis based on a one-dimensional (1D) model indicates that reducing the size of subwavelength features can enhance electrical properties, such as contact resistance and switching cutoff frequency. Here, we report higher-than-expected contact resistance in electronic metadevices when the subwavelength feature size is aggressively downscaled. We attribute this effect to transverse currents in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) running parallel to the stripe width. We present the first experimental demonstration of a metadevice governed by a one-dimensional model, which we refer to as a quasi-1D electronic metadevice and show that it enables enhanced electrical performance. Our findings pave the way to design next generation electronic metadevice switches with applications in future telecommunication circuits."

      "summary": "The linear (proportional to local vacancy concentration) term in specific resistance of the material does not directly contribute to the change of memristor's total resistance when the vacancies are redistributed inside while keeping their total number constant. But it still changes kinetics of the vacancy drift under the influence of a passing electric current. These changes are especially significant in the presence of metal-insulator phase transition in the memristor's material. In this paper, kinetic equation for local vacancy concentration is obtained, and exact solutions for its steady states are analyzed. It is shown that not only in the weakly nonlinear case (when the dependence of the specific resistance on the vacancy concentration can be neglected), but also in a strongly non-linear memristor with phase transition, its kinetics can be reduced to the classical exactly solvable Burgers equation."

The particles move in a pore with periodically modulated aperture, which is modeled by a quasi-one-dimensional channel with periodic tooth-shaped profile. Internal driving of the active particles induces a ratchet current of these particles. In the current-density diagram, we observe three main regimes: of free flow; of thermally activated processes; of spinodal decomposition. When the density of particles is increased, we observe a transition to jammed state, where the ratchet current is substantially reduced. In time evolution, the transition to jammed state is seen as sudden drop of current at certain time. The probability distribution of these jamming times follows an exponential law. The average jamming time depends itself exponentially on the density of active particles. The coefficient in this exponential is nearly independent of the switching rate of the active particles as well as on the presence or absence of passive particles. Due to the interaction, the current of active particles imposes a drag on the passive particles. In the limit of both large systems and long times, the current of passive particles has always the same direction as the ratchet current of active particles. However, during the evolution of the system we observe very slow (logarithmic in time) approach to the asymptotic value, sometimes accompanied by current reversal, i.e. current of active and passive particles may go in opposite direction."

Experimentally, however, it has been established that the Berry curvature does not play any role in the Hall resistance of the ferromagnet URhGe. URhGe is so called altermagnetic ferromagnet which crystal symmetry includes operation of time inversion only in combination with rotations and reflections. The explanation for strictly zero Berry curvature of electronic states in this material lies in the non-symmorphic symmetry of its crystal lattice."

We show that in mixtures, the ``Brazil nut'' phenomenon, or depletion of larger particles by force of smaller ones, appears quite generically. We calculate the ratchet current and quantify the capability of sorting particles according to their size.

However, the efficiency of III-V based mid-IR LEDs at room temperature is low, primarily limited by strong nonradiative Auger-Meitner recombination that is only partially overcome with complex quantum-engineered active regions. Here, we exploit the intrinsically low Auger Meitner recombination rates of the IV-VI semiconductors PbSe and PbSnSe, while leveraging the mature III-V platform through the fabrication of hybrid heterojunctions that mediate the ~8% lattice mismatch to GaAs. Electrically injected n-PbSe/p-GaAs LEDs emit at 3.8 um with output powers up to 400 uW under pulsed operation and a peak wall plug efficiency of 0.08% at room temperature, approaching the performance of commercial III-V LEDs at similar wavelengths. Incorporating 7% Sn extends the emission to 5 um in GeSe/PbSnSe/GaAs LEDs with output powers up to 45 uW. Notably, both devices operate despite threading dislocation densities on the order of 1e9/cm^2, underscoring the potential of hybrid IV-VI/III-V heterojunction architectures. We show that combining the complementary advantages of IV-VI and III-V semiconductors offers a simple and efficient mid IR optoelectronic platform for a rapidly expanding set of applications."

The generalization goes in two directions: relaxing the exclusion constraint by allowing several (but few) particles on a site, and by considering two species of particles, which differ by size and transport coefficients. We calculate the nearest-neighbor correlations using a variant of Kirkwood approximation and show by comparison with numerical simulations that the approximation provides quite accurate results. However, for long-range correlations, we show that the Kirkwood approximation is useless, as it predicts exponential decay of the density-density correlation function with distance, while simulation data indicate that the decay is algebraic. For one-component system, we show that the decay is governed by a power law with universal exponent close to 2. In two-component system, the correlation function behaves in more complicated manner; its sign oscillates but the envelope decays again very slowly and the decay is compatible with power-law with exponent somewhat lower than 2. Therefore, our generalization of ASEP belongs to different universality class than the ensemble of generalized ASEP models which are mappable to zero-range processes."

      "summary": "The research landscape of magnetism has been recently enriched by the discovery of altermagnetism. It is an unconventional phase of matter characterized by a d-wave (or higher even-parity-wave) collinear compensated spin ordering, which enables strongly spin-polarized currents in the absence of magnetization, and features fast spin dynamics. Simultaneously, on the applied magnetism front, spintronic memories based on conventional ferromagnets are currently turning from a niche to a mass produced integrated-circuit technology as they start to complement semiconductors on advanced-node microprocessor chips. Our review connects these two rapidly developing science and technology fields by discussing how the unique signatures of altermagnetism can impact the functionality and scalability of future spintronic devices. As a reference, we first briefly recall the merits and physical limitations of the present ferromagnetic spintronic technology, and of proof-of-concept spintronic devices based on conventional collinear antiferromagnets and non-collinear compensated magnets. The main part of the review then focuses on physical concepts of the altermagnetic spintronics, and its potential interplay with ferroelectricity or superconductivity. We conclude with an outlook on the nascent experimental research of altermagnetic spintronics, and on the role of relativistic phenomena."

This new phase cannot be indexed to any known ice frameworks - such as the high-pressure methane hydrates MH-III (Imma) or MH-IV (Pmcn) - and exhibits a density approximately 30% lower than that of stable ice VII, pointing to distinctive water-nitrogen interactions. Our results refine the understanding of nitrogen hydrate behavior under extreme conditions and demonstrate the propensity of nitrogen and water to form stable filled-ice structures up to 16 GPa, with important implications for planetary science."

      "summary": "Lattice vibrations are highly sensitive to crystal symmetries and their changes across phase transitions. The latter can modify irreducible (co)representations and corresponding infrared and Raman selection rules of phonons. This concept is established for relativistic magnetic point groups, simultaneously transforming spatial and spin coordinates. However, in altermagnets described by non-relativistic spin groups with disjunct symmetry operations for both vector spaces, the phonon selection rules have remained unexplored. Here, we present a detailed study of the infrared- and Raman-active modes in the collinear antiferromagnet and altermagnet candidate Co$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. Comparing to ab initio calculations accurately capturing the eigenfrequencies, we identify all expected phonon modes at room temperature and deduce their selection rules using both symmetry approaches. Importantly, we observe the change of selection rules upon antiferromagnetic ordering, agreeing with the relativistic symmetry approach, while the spin group formalism predicts no changes. Therefore, optical phonons can reveal the appropriate symmetry treatment."

      "summary": "Directed cycles form the fundamental motifs in natural, social and artificial networks, yet their distinct computational roles remain under-explored, particularly in the context of higher-order structure and function. In this work, we investigate how two types of directed cycles - feedforward and feedback - can act as higher-order structures to facilitate the flow and integration of information in sparse random networks, and how these roles depend on the environment of the cycles. Using information-theoretic measures, we show that network size, sparsity and relative directionality critically impact the information-processing capacities of directed cycles. In a network with no-preferred global direction, a feedforward cycle enables greater information flow and a feedback cycle allows for increased information integration. The relative direction of a feedforward cycle as well as the structural incoherence it induces, determines its capacity to generate higher-order behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that introducing feedback loops into otherwise feedforward architectures increases the diversity of network activity patterns. These findings suggest that directed cycles serve as computational motifs with local information processing capabilities that depend on the structure they are embedded. Using directed cycles, we highlight the interdependence between higher-order structures and the higher-order order behaviour they can induce in the network dynamics."

We demonstrate that such reactions affect phase separation by altering the chemical potential balance and by introducing an osmotic pressure difference at interfaces. However, the system does not permit a pseudo-pressure balance, and bulk compositions depend on which phases are in contact. Moreover, phase coexistence is no longer transitive, which enables self-propelled phases and more complex dynamics."

      "summary": "Phase separation of a liquid mixture embedded within an elastic network is relevant to a wide range of natural and industrial systems, including biomolecular condensates interacting with the cytoskeleton, structural colouring in bird feathers, and gas bubbles forming within soft sediments. Recent experiments in synthetic polymer gels have demonstrated that when the size of phase-separated domains is comparable to the characteristic pore size of the network, a patterned phase with a well-defined length scale may emerge. Theoretical works based on an equilibrium approach have attributed this pattern formation to non-local elastic effects arising from heterogeneity of the underlying network. Here, we extend these ideas by developing a dynamic theory in which phase separation is coupled to non-local elasticity via the framework of large-deformation poroelasticity. We study our model via both linear stability analysis and numerical simulation, identifying the parameter space in which phase separation occurs, and investigating the impact of different elasticity models. We find that although local elasticity can inhibit phase separation and affect domain count, it is unable to completely suppress coarsening. In contrast, non-local elasticity arrests coarsening to form patterned domains with a well-defined length scale that decreases with increasing stiffness. Our modelling framework thus paves the way for quantitative comparisons between simulations and experiments, for example by considering a strain-stiffening network rheology."

Previously it was shown that the sign structures of frustrated systems are of complex nature: specifically, neural networks of popular architectures lack the generalization ability necessary to effectively reconstruct sign structures in supervised learning settings. This is believed to be an obstacle for applications of neural quantum states to frustrated systems. In the present work, we develop an alternative language for the analysis of sign structures based on representing them as polynomial functions defined on the Boolean hypercube - an approach called Boolean Fourier analysis. We discuss the relations between the properties of the Boolean Fourier series and the learning complexity of sign structures, and demonstrate that such polynomials can potentially serve as variational ans\\\"atze for the complex sign structures that dramatically outperform neural networks in terms of generalization ability. While ans\\\"atze of this type cannot yet be directly used in the context of variational optimization, they indicate that the complexity of sign structures is not an insurmountable curse, and can potentially be learned with better designed NQS architectures. Finally, we show how augmenting data with Boolean functions can aid sign prediction by neural networks."

Exploiting an exact ground-state (Doob) transform, we map the stochastic generator of the SDEP onto the spin-$1/2$ XX quantum chain, which in turn admits a free-fermion representation. At macroscopic scales we conjecture that the SDEP displays ballistic (Eulerian) scaling and non-local hydrodynamics governed by the equation $\\partial_t \\rho+\\partial_x j[\\rho]=0$ with $j[\\rho]=(1/\\pi)\\sin(\\pi\\rho(x,t))\\sinh(\\pi\\mathcal{H}\\rho(x,t))$, where $\\mathcal{H}$ is the Hilbert transform, making the current a genuinely non-local functional of the density. This non-local one-field description is equivalent to a local two-field \"complex Hopf\" system for finite particle density. Closed evolution formulas allow us to solve the melting of single and double block initial states, producing limit shapes and arctic curves that agree with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations.

      "summary": "The doping evolution of the nodal electron dynamics in the trilayer cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\\delta}$ (Bi2223) is investigated using high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Bi2223 single crystals with different doping levels are prepared by controlled annealing which cover the underdoped, optimally-doped and overdoped regions. The electronic phase diagram of Bi2223 is established which describes the T$_\\mathrm{c}$ dependence on the sample doping level. The doping dependence of the nodal Fermi momentum for the outer (OP) and inner (IP) CuO$_2$ planes is determined. Charge distribution imbalance between the OP and IP CuO$_2$ planes is quantified, showing enhanced disparity with increasing doping. Nodal band dispersions demonstrate a prominent kink at $\\sim$94$\\,$meV in the IP band, attributed to the unique Cu coordination in the IP plane, while a weaker $\\sim$60$\\,$meV kink is observed in the OP band. The nodal Fermi velocity of both OP and IP bands is nearly constant at $\\sim$1.62$\\,$eV\\r{A} independent of doping. These results provide important information to understand the origin of high T$_\\mathrm{c}$ and superconductivity mechanism in high temperature cuprate superconductors."

      "summary": "Kagome materials exhibit unique electronic properties, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. In the breathing Kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted, and increasing the polar angle induces successive closing and reopening of the valleys. For chiral spin textures, increasing polar angle enlarges the bandgap when chirality \\k{appa} = 1, while reducing it when \\k{appa} = -1. Moreover, spin chirality enables the quantum anomalous Hall state without spin-orbit coupling. Structural asymmetry and spin chirality effectively modulate the bandgap, Chern number, and valley polarization. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems."

The interplay of advection and steric interactions produces a number of interesting effects, like the stirring of a passive colloidal fluid by a small fraction of slow active particles, or the separation of the mixture active and passive colloidal fractions by increasing the motility of the active one, which eventually clusters in stagnation areas along the array walls. These mechanisms are quantitatively characterized by studying the dependence of the diffusion constants of the active and passive particles on the parameters of the active mixture fraction."

Nonetheless, understanding of memory and nonlinearity in non-equilibrium transitions remains elusive as they can involve timescales from femtoseconds to microseconds. In this study, we extend time-resolved x-ray Bragg diffraction to the necessary high dynamic range of timescales to fully trace the pathways of far-from-equilibrium photoexcited transitions in epitaxial films of V2O3, a technologically promising prototypical Mott insulator. We find a 105 times adjustment in relaxation time: the memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity during transition causes a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts shaped relaxation lingering over a hundred microseconds versus nanoseconds. The dramatic slowdown in the light-driven highly correlated system accompanies heterogeneous excitation barriers, as in neural systems."

Similarly to passive particles, active microswimmers exhibit advection enhanced diffusion, but only for self-propulsion speeds up to a critical value. The diffusion of faster Janus particles is governed by advection along the array's edges, whereby distinct diffusion regimes are observed and characterized. Contrary to passive particles, the relevant spatial distributions of active Janus particles are inhomogeneous. These peculiar properties of active matter are related to the combined action of noise and self-propulsion in a confined geometry and hold regardless of the actual flow boundary conditions."

Using a zero-temperature, self-consistent Hartree-Fock approach, we study two experimentally relevant deviations from the ideal equal-mass isotropic case: (i) isotropic but unequal conduction and valence band masses ($m_c^* \\neq m_v^*$), and (ii) equal average masses with orthogonal in-plane anisotropies $(m_{c,x}^*, m^*_{c,y}) = (m_1^*, m_2^*)$ and $(m^*_{v,x}, m^*_{v,y}) = (m_2^*, m_1^*)$. For both scenarios, we compute the order parameter and analyze the BEC-BCS crossover as a function of layer separation and mass ratio. We find that both mass imbalance and mass anisotropy reduce the pairing strength and suppress the inferred critical temperature $T_c$ by breaking perfect Fermi surface nesting, and shift the BEC-BCS crossover. Despite these effects, superfluidity remains robust across the full range of densities and interlayer separations considered, with no transition to an unpaired plasma state in the absence of screening. Our results provide a baseline for understanding the interplay of mass mismatch and anisotropy in current and emerging bilayer platforms, including van der Waals heterostructures and anisotropic two-dimensional semiconductors. Our work also establishes that Fermi surface nesting is not a key ingredient for the bilayer superfluidity, which is always the ground state for all electron-hole bilayers although the resultant $T_c$ depends on the parameter details and may very well be unmeasurably low for large interlayer separations."

Focusing on the heat current as the primary observable, we analyze both the transient dynamics and the long-time behavior of the system. We demonstrate that simple toy models - including Random Matrix Theory like models ({\\it RMT models}) and Schwarzian like models ({\\it conformal models}) - can capture many generic features of heat transport, such as transient current peaks and the emergence of non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). For these models, we derive a variety of exact results characterizing the short time transients, long time approach to NESS and thermal conductivity. Finally, we show how these features appear in a more realistic solvable model, the Double-Scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. We demonstrate that the DSSYK model interpolates between the seemingly distinct toy models discussed earlier, with the toy models in turn providing a useful lens through which to understand the rich features of DSSYK."

All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the \"heavy eggs\") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the \"chickens\"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely \"maximum stable mass\" and \"bosenova\") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations."

However, these operations can be experimentally costly due to the need for local addressing, demanding significant classical control. A more resource-efficient alternative to extract information is uniform measurement, where a site-independent rotation of qubits is performed before measuring in the computational basis. This operation can be performed in parallel, or globally, in atom- and ion-based platforms, reducing resource cost and increasing fidelity. In this work, we initiate the exploration of the utility of this operation in quantum information processing. In particular, we demonstrate that uniform measurements can certify certain graph states, a family of highly entangled and broadly useful quantum states. We provide a sample-efficient certification algorithm with a proved performance guarantee, together with an experimental scheme based on analog-mode Rydberg atom arrays. Uniform measurements, therefore, allow direct and efficient characterization of quantum states on quantum platforms in a hitherto unexplored manner."

      "summary": "A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can be unbounded or fails to scale with system size."

Through analysis of the long-time dynamical behaviors of atoms and bound photons, we carry out a detailed classification of bound states and explore the connections between these dynamical behaviors and the system's intrinsic light-matter interactions. The system supports static bound states with persistent atomic excitations, and oscillating bound states with periodic atom-photon or atom-atom excitation exchange. Under certain conditions, oscillating bound states can contain more harmonic components owing to the emergence of additional quasi-dark modes, rendering them promising platforms for high-capacity quantum information processing. These findings advance the understanding of BIC in waveguide quantum electrodynamics with multiple giant atoms and reveal their prospective applications in quantum technologies."

We consider the cases of (1) periodic bulk media having the symmetries of a square lattice, and (2) linear deformations of such media. Our bulk Hamiltonians break time-reversal symmetry due to perturbation by a magnetic term, which opens a band gap about the band structure degeneracies of the unperturbed bulk Hamiltonian. In case (1), these are quadratic band degeneracies; in case (2), they are pairs of conical degeneracies. We demonstrate that this band gap is traversed by two distinct edge state curves, consistent with the bulk-edge correspondence principle of topological physics. Blow-ups of these curves near the bulk band degeneracies are described by effective (homogenized) edge Hamiltonians derived via multiple-scale analysis which control the bifurcation of edge states. In case (1), the bifurcation is governed by a matrix Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator; in case (2), it is governed by a pair of Dirac operators. We present analytical results and numerical simulations for both the full 2D edge Hamiltonian spectral problem and the spectra of effective edge Hamiltonians."

In this paper, we calculate the average subsystem Bures distance in the spin-1/2 transverse-field Ising chain. We develop an efficient algorithm to evaluate the Bures distance between two Gaussian states, which allows us to access larger system sizes. To address the degeneracy issue, we consider simultaneous eigenstates of all local conserved charges and use these charges to systematically order degenerate states. The results align with the conjectured linear increase with subsystem size. We demonstrate that the distinct scaling behaviors of the average subsystem trace and Bures distances in chaotic versus integrable systems stem from discontinuities of local conserved charges across the spectrum in integrable systems. Additionally, we investigate the average subsystem distances between random pure Gaussian states but do not observe a linear increase."

      "summary": "Silicon is the most important semiconductor electrode with applications in photoelectrochemistry and sensor technology. Yet its electrochemistry exhibits many poorly understood phenomena, including oscillations during the anodic dissolution of silicon electrodes. In this article, we present a mathematical model based on physicochemical steps that captures these oscillations and enables a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanism. The model describes the formation and dissolution of an oxide layer, and determines the oxide composition and the electrostatic potential in the direction perpendicular to the electrode. Oscillations occur if the following conditions are fulfilled: 1. The etching speed increases with defects in the oxide layer 2. The number of defects decreases with increasing electric field strength at the Si-oxide interface. 3. There is a sufficient time delay between the production and the etching of the oxide. Numerical simulations reproduce experimental results well, including the dependence of the oscillation amplitude and period on the potential, as well as the hysteresis behavior observed in cyclic voltammetry. Based on these results, we derive a simplified time-delay differential equation model. Using linear stability analysis, we confirm the essential role of the time delay for the oscillatory oxide-layer dynamics. The basic steps of the model are general and in line with the point defect model for growth and dissolution of passive films on metal electrodes. Therefore, it is likely applicable to a variety of oscillating anodic metal or semiconductor dissolution reactions."

      "summary": "Secondary electron (SE) imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy and helium ion microscopy (HIM), use electrons emitted by a sample in response to a focused beam of charged particles incident at a grid of raster scan positions. Spot size -- the diameter of the incident beam's spatial profile -- is one of the limiting factors for resolution, along with various sources of noise in the SE signal. The effect of the beam spatial profile is commonly understood as convolutional. We show that under a simple and plausible physical abstraction for the beam, though convolution describes the mean of the SE counts, the full distribution of SE counts is a mixture. We demonstrate that this more detailed modeling can enable resolution improvements over conventional estimators through a stylized application in semiconductor inspection of localizing the edge in a two-valued sample. We derive Fisher information about edge location in conventional and time-resolved measurements (TRM) and also derive the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) from the latter. Empirically, the MLE computed from TRM is approximately efficient except at very low beam diameter, so Fisher information comparisons are predictive of performance and can be used to optimize the beam diameter relative to the raster scan spacing. Monte Carlo simulations show that the MLE gives a 5-fold reduction in root mean-squared error (RMSE) of edge localization as compared to conventional interpolation-based estimation. Applied to three real HIM datasets, the average RMSE reduction factor is 5.4."

We find there exists a tiny yet finite value of the order parameters at the AFXY-VBS phase transition points of the EPJQ model, and the finite order parameter is strengthened as anisotropy $\\Delta$ varies from the Heisenberg limit ($\\Delta=1$) to the easy-plane limit ($\\Delta=0$). This observation provides evidence that the N\\'eel-VBS transition in the JQ model setting evolves from weak to prominent first-order transition as the system becomes anisotropic. Furthermore, both EE and disorder operator with smooth boundary cut exhibit anomalous scaling behavior at the transition points, resembling the scaling inside the Goldstone mode (AFXY) phase, and the anomalous scaling becomes strengthened as the transition becomes more first order. In particular, for $\\Delta \\le 0.3$, the obtained log-coefficients converge to 0.5 which is the same as the contribution from one Goldstone mode in the N\\'eel phase. For $\\Delta > 0.3$, the log-coefficients are smaller and our findings might suffer from strong finite-size effects due to the fact that the remaining N\\'eel order here is quite tiny."

Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases."

This is because the intersection of the folded hysteresis trajectories exhibits a sharp peak near the phase transition, amplifying the response to small changes in the microwave field. Here, we demonstrate an experiment of enhanced metrology through flipping the hysteresis trajectory in a cold atomic system, displaying an approach to improve sensitivity near the gap-closing points. By measuring the intersection points of hysteresis trajectories versus Rabi frequency of the microwave field, we quantify the equivalent sensitivity to be 1.6(5) nV cm-1 Hz-1/2. The measurement is also dependent on the interaction time, optical depth and principal quantum number since the long-range interaction between Rydberg atoms could dramatically change the shape of hysteresis trajectories. The reported results suggest that flipping trajectory features in cold Rydberg many-body systems could advance sensing and metrology applications."

Accurately and efficiently describing the adsorption has been a challenging task for first-principles methods as the process can involve both short-range chemical bond formations and long-range physical interactions, e.g., the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Density functional theory presents an appealing choice for modeling adsorption reactions, though calculations with many exchange correlation density functional approximations struggle to accurately describe both chemical and physical molecular adsorptions. Here, we propose an efficient density functional approximation that is accurate for both chemical and physical adsorption by concurrently optimizing its semilocal component and the long-range vdW correction against the prototypical adsorption CO/Pt(111) and Ar$_2$ binding energy curve. The resulting functional opens the door to accurate and efficient modeling of general molecular adsorption."

      "summary": "Nanoscale topological spin textures in magnetic systems are emerging as promising candidates for scalable quantum architectures. Despite their potential as qubits, previous studies have been limited to semiclassical approaches, leaving a critical gap: the lack of a fully quantum demonstration. Here, we address this challenge by employing the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to establish domain wall (DW) qubits in coupled quantum spin-1/2 chains. We calculate the ground-state energies and excitation gaps of the system and find that DWs with opposite chiralities form a well-defined low-energy sector, distinctly isolated from higher excited states in the presence of anisotropies. This renders the chirality states suitable for encoding quantum information, serving as robust qubits. Interestingly, when a magnetic field is applied, we observe tunneling between quantum DW states with opposite chiralities. Through quantum simulations, we construct an effective qubit Hamiltonian that exhibits strongly anisotropic $g$-factors, offering a way to implement single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we obtain an effective interacting Hamiltonian for two mobile DWs in coupled quantum spin chains from DMRG simulations, enabling the implementation of two-qubit gates.Single-qubit and two-qubit gates are also demonstrated in real-time simulations using the time-dependent variational principle. Our work represents a critical step from semiclassical constructions to a fully quantum demonstration of the potential of DW textures for scalable quantum computing, establishing a solid foundation for future quantum architectures based on topological magnetic textures."

Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations. Our analytic approach is compared with the topological bulk-edge correspondence, which is based on the Chern number of the bulk."

For systems governed by overdamped Langevin dynamics, we propose the counterintuitive approach of adding noise in order to increase the precision of such calculations. By introducing additional stochastic fluctuations to the system and rescaling its potential energy, we leave the thermodynamics of the system unchanged while increasing its relaxation rate. For a given time-dependent protocol this modification reduces dissipated work, leading to more accurate free-energy estimates. We demonstrate this principle using computer simulations applied to two model systems. However, the regime of applicability of this strategy is likely limited, because it requires control of the system's potential energy in a way that is feasible in only a few experimental settings."

      "summary": "Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, R\\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving R\\'{e}nyi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true R\\'{e}nyi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted R\\'{e}nyi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent R\\'{e}nyi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems."

Using numerical results for larger fields, we also observe a first-order quantum phase transition into a quantum paramagnet, as in previous studies of spin models based on linear CA rules."

Circularly polarized phonons, possessing nonzero angular momentum (AM), have drawn widespread attention recently. Despite widespread use of pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) and circularly polarized light polarization flips to identify chiral phonons in Raman scattering, their reliability is debated due to symmetry dependence, and experimental verification standards remain lacking. Here, we systematically study phonon chirality and associated phenomena across magnetic point groups. We establish that the AM-PAM correlation is governed by both crystalline symmetry and Wyckoff positions, dictating conditions where nonzero AM manifests in PAM signatures. Crucially, phonons belonging to distinct irreducible representations exhibit distinct experimental benchmarks, enabling direct determination of crystalline chirality and symmetry classification. Furthermore, we report the discovery of a signature for symmetry-induced phenomena, notably a half-wave plate-analogous effect induced by mirror-odd phonons. Meanwhile, we conducted five experiments to validate our theory."

A range of host materials are selected for their desirable properties, such as appropriate bandgaps, crystal structure, and absence of d- or f-electrons. The Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) software framework is used to generate vacancies, substitutions with s- and p-elements, and interstitials in these materials and use density functional theory to calculate key properties such as Zero-Phonon Lines (ZPLs), ionic displacements, Transition Dipole Moments (TDMs), and formation energies. Special attention is given to charge correction methods for materials with dielectric anisotropy. We uncover new defect-host combinations with advantageous properties for quantum applications: 28 defects across 11 isotropic and 2 anisotropic host materials show properties similar to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Beryllium (Be) substitutional defects in SrS, MgS, and SrO emerge as particularly promising. These findings contribute to diversifying and enhancing the materials available for quantum technologies."

We show that, in a suitable parameter regime, the interplay between rotating magnetic fields and spatially modulated interwire tunnelings leads to the opening of gaps in the bulk and surface spectrum of the system, while one or more chiral hinge states propagating along a closed path of one-dimensional hinges are left gapless. The exact path of these hinge states is determined by the hierarchy of interwire couplings and the boundary termination of the sample. Depending on the ratio between the period of the rotating magnetic field and the Fermi wavelength, our model can realize both integer and fractional chiral SOTIs. The fractional regime emerges in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and features hinge states carrying only a fraction $e/p$ of the electronic charge $e$ for a positive odd integer $p$."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particle systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, exhibit topological phase transitions between unique 2D phases. However, to identify the phases, an easy and computationally low-cost methodology for capturing the configurational properties of lattice ordering and constructing such an appropriate descriptor that can be easily calculated is, though, not obvious. Here, we propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based topological indicator, which selectively counts stable features in a persistence diagram, effectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering (the magnitude of the orientational order parameter $\\langle|\\Psi_6|\\rangle$), typically used to identify lattice phases. We demonstrate the applicability of our indicator to experimental data, showing that it yields results consistent with those of simulations. This experimental validation highlights the robustness of the proposed method for real physical systems beyond idealized simulated systems. While our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of interacting quasi-particles. As a key advantage, our indicator offers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used measures."

      "summary": "Molybdenum sulfide clusters, [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, have emerged as key molecular models for understanding active sites in Mo-S-based catalysts and as promising candidates for energy conversion applications. Despite their importance, comprehensive vibrational characterization of these clusters remains limited. Here, we present a detailed Raman and infrared spectroscopic analysis of both clusters, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. High-quality crystalline samples were synthesized and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to confirm morphology and stoichiometry. Raman spectra, acquired using 488 nm and 532 nm laser excitation, were deconvoluted using Lorentzian fitting. Vibrational mode assignments were made through direct comparison with DFT predictions. For [Mo3S4]4+, major Raman bands appear near 200 cm^-1, 350 cm^-1, and 450 cm^-1, corresponding to Mo-S-Mo bending, Mo-S stretching, and terminal sulfur vibrations. [Mo3S13]2- shows two distinct spectral regions: 100-400 cm^-1 for Mo-S and S-S bending and stretching, and 450-550 cm^-1 for terminal disulfide (S-S) stretching. Complementary IR spectra calculations reveal additional vibrational features, yielding a more complete fingerprint for each cluster. Finally, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy offers greater sensitivity than X-ray diffraction (XRD) in detecting these clusters on supporting materials. This work provides a detailed vibrational reference for [Mo3S4]4+ and [Mo3S13]2-, establishing Raman and IR spectroscopy as powerful tools for characterizing Mo-S molecular clusters in both fundamental and applied contexts."

However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducing circuits."

However, the Schr\\\"odinger-Pauli theory is fundamentally incomplete in its account of broken time inversion symmetry, e.g., in magnetically ordered systems. In the Dirac theory of the electron, magnetic order breaks time inversion symmetry even in the nonrelativistic limit, whereas time inversion symmetry is effectively preserved in the Schr\\\"odinger-Pauli theory in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In the Dirac theory, the Berry curvature $1/(2m^2c^2)$ is thus an intrinsic property of nonrelativistic electrons similar to the well-known spin magnetic moment $e\\hbar/(2m)$, while this result is missed by the nonrelativistic or weakly relativistic Schr\\\"odinger-Pauli equation. In ferromagnetically ordered systems, the intrinsic Berry curvature yields a contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity independent of spin-orbit coupling."

We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation. We discuss a holographic correspondence between boundary and bulk behaviors and derive exact expressions for boundary correlation functions on Cayley trees."

Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming \"dead Li\" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them."

As an application, this method is applied to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion. Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior dependent on the cavity parameters."

However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. This unique structure, conceptualized as a \"self-Moir\\'e\" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge.

Depth-resolved Laue micro-diffraction (~10^4 strain sensitivity), nanoindentation, and AFM reveal non-monotonic evolution of lattice strain and hardness: both decrease with temperature up to ~300C, then increase beyond.

To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ans\\\"atze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states."

We focus on matrices with nonzero leading principal minors and elements that decay to zero exponentially fast with the distance from the main diagonal, but we relax the constraint of the Toeplitz structure. We obtain an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the determinant written in terms of the factors of a left and right Wiener-Hopf type factorization of an appropriately defined symbol. For matrices with elements varying slowly along the diagonals (e.g., in locally Toeplitz sequences), we propose to apply the analogue of the semiclassical expansion of the Moyal star product in phase-space quantum mechanics. This is a systematic method that provides approximations up to any order in the typical scale of the inhomogeneity and allows us to obtain explicit asymptotic formulas."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Diffusion and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to study movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). However, these measures - corresponding to specific displacement moments - do not capture the full complexity of movement behavior. Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\\textit{Tyto alba}), we reveal strong anomalous diffusion as nonlinear growth of displacement moments. The moment spectrum function $\\lambda_t(q)$ -- defined by $\\left \\sim t^{\\lambda_t(q)}$ -- displays piecewise linearity in $q$, with a critical moment marking the crossover between scaling regimes. This highlights the need of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize movement, which we link to age-specific ecological drivers. Furthermore, a characteristic timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex to a concave $\\lambda_t(q)$. Using two stochastic models - a bounded L\\'evy walk and a multi-mode behavioral model - we account for the observed phenomena, showing good agreement with data, relating age-specific behavioral states to environmentally confined movement, and demonstrating how L\\'evy walk-like patterns can arise from underlying behavioral structure. Finally, we discuss the ecological significance of our results, arguing that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement."

We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions, we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order, which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760, closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants."

In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring realizing the generalized symmetry of an ultraviolet (UV) theory plays a fundamental role in determining condensation rules between anyons, resulting in the infrared (IR) theories. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and (2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime \\textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state ensemble living on its temporal \\textit{boundary}. Building on this correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in \\textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in ${\\cal O}(1)$ circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit protocol to coherent noise."

Recently, silicates have emerged as a promising new class of 2D materials, but their nonlinear optical properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate layer-dependent nonlinear absorption and optical limiting capabilities of 2D muscovite using femtosecond laser excitation at 450 nm. The two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient is highly sensitive to both the number of layers and excitation intensity, increasing markedly from (3.91+/-0.06)x10^3 cm GW^-1 in multilayer structures to (6.94+/-0.17)x10^5 cm GW^-1 in the monolayer limit at a peak intensity of 68 GW cm^-2, highlighting a strong layer-dependent enhancement in nonlinear absorption. Additionally, monolayer muscovite exhibits an optical limiting threshold of 1.46 mJ cm^-2, outperforming graphene and other 2D dichalcogenides. This enhanced TPA arises from quantum confinement and intrinsic lattice defects that facilitate nonlinear optical transitions. Density functional theory reveals that liquid-phase exfoliation disrupts potassium interlayers and induces oxygen vacancies, generating mid-gap electronic states that significantly enhance TPA. These insights open new avenues for designing low-fluence, high-efficiency optical limiters using 2D silicates."

Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable."

Authors reveal that the polar smectic phase coexisting with a chiral ferroelectric nematic is itself helical, exhibits pseudo-ferrielectric switching, and shows both first- and second-order helix formation, with pre-transitional helices emerging in the nematic phase."
