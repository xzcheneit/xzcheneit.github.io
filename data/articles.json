The work discusses an architecture for quantum repeaters, in which information is encoded in error-correcting codes capable of handling both photon loss and logical errors. Advantages of this approach are that it can work with very limited resources at each repeater station, and is more robust to errors than previous techniques. The results can promote long-distance quantum communication at very high rates. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 044090] Published Wed Oct 29, 2025"

QOT has attracted considerable interest and seen substantial development, but has not yet reached its ultimate limit. The authors introduce a unified framework for optimal QOT by mapping the problem to the “clique cover” model from graph theory. This framework provides superlative efficiency and experimental feasibility in measurement strategies. This validation of QOT’s utility paves the way for advanced quantum system characterization and state-property learning. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 044091] Published Wed Oct 29, 2025"

      "summary": "Despite the well-established presence of amorphous compounds on planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mercury due to space weathering, the direct effect of atomic arrangement on the surface binding energies (SBEs) of elements on these bodies remains largely unexplored. Accurate SBE values are essential for reliably predicting sputtering yields and the energy distribution of ejecta. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify SBEs for the different elements sputtered from amorphous atomic arrangements of the plagioclase feldspar end members, albite and anorthite, and compare to their crystalline counterparts. Results show that while the mean elemental SBEs from amorphous surfaces are not significantly different from their crystalline counterparts, the random orientation in amorphous structures gives rise to a spectrum of bonding configurations, resulting in a distribution of SBEs with a wider range. This contrasts with the clearly discretized set of SBE values associated with the ordered atomic structure of crystalline surfaces. We then consider sputtering by H, He, and a solar wind combination of 96% H and 4% He. For each of these cases, we demonstrate that there is minimal difference (<10% for albite and <20% for anorthite) between the sputtering yields of amorphous and crystalline surfaces. We attribute these results to the presence of the same elemental bonds across different atomic arrangements, which leads to similar mean SBEs and, consequently, comparable sputtering yields."

      "summary": "An internal symmetry in a lattice model is said to be onsiteable if it can be disentangled into an onsite action by introducing ancillas and conjugating with a finite-depth circuit. A standard lore holds that onsiteability is equivalent to being anomaly-free, which is indeed valid for finite 0-form symmetries in (1+1)D. However, for higher-form symmetries, these notions become inequivalent: a symmetry may be onsite while still anomalous. In this work, we clarify the conditions for onsiteability of higher-form symmetries by proposing an equivalence between onsiteability and the possibility of $higher$ gauging. For a finite 1-form symmetry in (2+1)D, we show that the symmetry is onsiteable if and only if its 't Hooft anomaly satisfies a specific algebraic condition that ensures the symmetry can be 1-gauged. We further demonstrate that onsiteable 1-form symmetry in (2+1)D can always be brought into transversal Pauli operators by ancillas and circuit conjugation. In generic dimensions, we derive necessary conditions for onsiteability using lattice 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetry, and conjecture a general equivalence between onsiteability and possibility of higher gauging on lattices."

      "summary": "Pyrochlore magnets are a paradigmatic example of three-dimensional frustrated systems and provide an excellent platform for studying a variety of exotic many-body phenomena, including spin liquids, nematic phases, fragmentation, and order by disorder. In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to bilinear spin models on this lattice, where multiple magnetic phases can be degenerate in energy, often stabilizing unconventional magnetic states. In this work, we focus on one such model, parametrized by the interaction coupling $J_{z\\pm}$, which defines a line in parameter space corresponding to the phase boundary between three distinct magnetic phases. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we show that this model exhibits an order-by-disorder mechanism at low temperatures, giving rise to a \\emph{mixed} magnetic phase. This represents the first realization of a $\\mathbf{q}=0$ long-range-ordered phase in a pyrochlore magnet characterized by two distinct order parameters, which we denote as the $A_2 \\oplus \\psi_2$ phase. Furthermore, at $J_{z\\pm} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, the model acquires a subextensive number of discrete symmetries, which preclude the stabilization of conventional long-range order and instead lead to the emergence of a novel nematic phase. We characterize this nematic phase, describe how its ground-state configurations are constructed, and analyze its stability at higher temperatures and under small deviations from $J_{z\\pm} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$."

We argue that this tends to imply the vanishing of a certain \"mass\" term in the field theory of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) for monitored, interacting fermions. To explore this idea, we consider the MIPT with no conserved quantities that describes 1D monitored, interacting Majorana fermions in class DIII. We conjecture that the MIPT is the noninteracting DIII one in this case; the volume-law phase arises through the dangerously irrelevant mass. We propose numerical tests of our conjecture and analytically identify a candidate noninteracting critical point."

      "summary": "We investigate the impact of two-level systems (TLSs) on superconductivity, treating them as soft modes localised in real space. We show that these defects can either enhance or suppress the superconducting critical temperature, depending on their surface density and average frequency. Using thin-film aluminium as a case study, we quantitatively describe how TLSs modify both the critical temperature and the zero-temperature superconducting gap. Our results thus highlight new opportunities for tailoring material properties through TLS engineering."

      "summary": "We study one dimensional quantum spin chains whose nearest neighbor interactions are random matrices that square to one. By employing free probability theory, we establish a mapping from the many-body quantum dynamics of energy density in the original chain to a single-particle hopping dynamics when the local Hilbert space dimension is large. The hopping occurs on the Cayley graph of an infinite Coxeter reflection group. Adjacency matrices on large finite clusters of this Cayley graph can be constructed numerically by leveraging the automatic structure of the group. The density of states and two-point functions of the local energy density are approximately computed and consistent with the physics of a generic local Hamiltonian: Gaussian density of states and thermalization of energy density. We then ask what happens to the physics if we modify the group on which the hopping dynamics occurs, and conjecture that adding braid relations into the group leads to integrability. Our results put into contact ideas in free probability theory, quantum mechanics of hyperbolic lattices, and the physics of both generic and integrable Hamiltonian dynamics."

The logic applies to regions with sharp corners, from which we derive several universal properties regarding corner entanglement. These universal properties follow from a set of locally-checkable conditions on the wavefunction. We also define a quantity $(\\mathfrak{c}_{\\text{tot}})_{\\text{min}}$ that reflects the robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped states that is not visible in topological field theory."

      "summary": "We derive the normal and anomalous proper polarization functions and the screened Coulomb interactions in a two-dimensional superfluid electron-hole bilayer, including all first-order corrections beyond the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). This requires a modification of the perturbation method as first noted by Nozi\\`eres and Schrieffer [1, 2]. We discuss the physical origin and magnitude of the first-order corrections in a superfluid system with long-range Coulomb interactions. Unlike conventional superconductivity, Migdal's theorem does not apply here, so exchange vertex corrections cannot be neglected. The screened electron-electron, hole-hole, and electron-hole interactions in the superfluid state are evaluated as functions of the carrier density. We find that at low density, the strong cancellations between the normal and anomalous components that make screening of the interactions negligible, apply not only within RPA but also with the first-order corrections included. As the density is increased, the normal-anomalous cancellation weakens and screening becomes increasingly significant. We find that the first-order corrections amplify the normal-anomalous difference but only at large momenta exchanged in the two-particle scattering, so their effect on the interactions remains modest. We conclude that the superfluid state RPA is an excellent approximation for the screening and for the effective electron-hole pairing in this superfluid system over the range of densities up to the maximum of the superfluid gap."

Field-dependent magnetization measurements reveal a large magnetic anisotropy at low temperatures with an easy axis along the crystallographic c-axis, in which direction a spin-flop transition exhibits strong features in magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity at H$_c$ = 75 kOe. The constructed temperature-field phase diagram connects this transition to the suppression of magnetic order, which evolves from a second-order nature into a first-order transition that bifurcates at the spin-flop into three transitions below 1 K. The smoothed nature of the metamagnetic transitions in non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$ is well described by an Ising model with weak quenched disorder, suggesting that the presence of Au vacancies is sufficient to smear the complex metamagnetic behavior and tune the critical behavior of magnetic order."

      "summary": "Recent theoretical advances have highlighted the role of Bloch state intrinsic properties in enabling unconventional electro-optic (EO) phenomena in bulk metals, offering novel strategies for dynamic optical control in quantum materials. Here, we identify an alternative EO mechanism in bulk metallic systems that arises from the interplay between Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons. Focusing on twisted double-bilayer graphene (TDBG), we show that the enhanced intrinsic properties of moir\\'e Bloch bands give rise to a sizable linear magnetoelectric EO response, a first-order, electric-field-induced non-Hermitian correction to the gyrotropic magnetic susceptibility. This mechanism dominates in $C_{3z}$-symmetric TDBG, where EO contributions originating from the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) are symmetry-forbidden. Our calculations reveal giant, gate-tunable linear and circular dichroism in the terahertz regime, establishing a robust and tunable platform for ultrafast EO modulation in two-dimensional materials beyond the BCD paradigm."

Previously, a two-band internally antisymmetric non-unitary triplet pairing (INT) state was proposed for this system, with equal spin-pairing and two distinct gaps associated with different spins. A detailed examination of the temperature dependence of the NQR data shows that the data best fit an INT model if the two gaps are equal and the model is unitary. Even a tiny non-unitarity with two unequal gaps causes the coherence peak to diminish rapidly and deviate from the data. On the other hand, the data are well-fit by a two-band singlet BCS-like pairing with two distinct gaps consistent with previous measurements. This raises doubts on the identification of non-unitary triplet-pairing with time-reversal symmetry breaking in this material."

Two types of grounded substrate holders, copper and stainless steel, were employed to assess substrate-dependent effects. The intrinsic stress, determined by the wafer curvature method, decreases with increasing film thickness but increases with the annealing temperature. It is observed that for thinner as-deposited chromium films, the stress showed a pronounced irreversible increase when measured immediately after deposition and after several days of aging. Films deposited on copper holders consistently exhibited higher stress values than those grown on stainless steel holders. These observations suggest that the intrinsic stress in as-deposited films is linked to the growth mechanism, while the stress increase after annealing may be related to thermally active diffusion and structural relaxation. The higher stress in films grown on copper substrate holder can likely be associated with enhanced ion bombardment due to the higher electrical conductivity of copper."

      "summary": "Understanding how granular materials respond to shear stress remains a central challenge in soft matter physics. We report direct observations of persistent granular convection in the bulk shear zones of spherical particle packings -- a phenomenon previously associated primarily with particle shape anisotropy or boundary effects. By employing various bead-coloring techniques in a split-bottom geometry, we reveal internal flow fields within sheared granular packings. We find robust convective structures, strikingly governed by system geometry: at low filling heights, two counter-rotating convection rolls emerge, while at higher filling heights, a single dominant convection cell forms, featuring radially outward flow at the surface. This transition is driven by the height-dependent broadening of the shear zone, which introduces shear rate asymmetry across its flanks. Notably, the transition occurs entirely within the open shear band regime. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of system geometry for secondary flow formation in dense packings of frictional particles, with significant implications for geophysical flows and industrial processes."

Xray reflectivity measurements shows the progressive formation of an additional layer in between the 3 nm thick Si capping layer and the NdCo compound film. Hard Xray Photoemission spectroscoy (HAXPES) was used to analyze the composition and distribution of cobalt and neodymium at the top layers region of NdCo$_{4.6}$ films of thickness ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm using 7 keV, 10 keV and 13 keV incident photon energies, with inelastic electron mean free paths ranging from 7.2 nm to 12.3 nm in cobalt. The atomic cobalt concentration of the alloy deduced from HAXPES measurements at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations results to be bellow the nominal value, changing with thickness and incident photon energy. This proves a segregation of the rare earth at the surface of the NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin film which increases with thickness. The analysis of the background of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks was consistent with this conclusion. This demonstrates that neodymium incorporation in the cobalt lattice have a cost in energy which can be associated to strain due to the difference in volume between the two elements. The lowering of this strain energy will favor atomic anisotropic environments for neodymium that explains the perpendicular anisotropy and its thickness dependence of these thin film compounds."

Therefore, the spin-momentum locking differs among the three spin components Sx, Sy, and Sz, forming the relativistic spin-momentum locking. We consider orthorhombic YVO3 and hexagonal MnTe. For YVO3, the relativistic locking comprises s-, dxy -, and dxz-wave. In MnTe, the dominant component Sy of MnTe inherits the polarized charge distribution and the non-relativistic spin-momentum locking bulk g-wave, but the breaking of the C6z rotational symmetry by the Neel vector lowers the symmetry from g-wave to d-wave. The relativistic spin-momentum locking for MnTe is composed of dxz-, dyz- and s-wave. Despite small magnitudes in real space, the canted spin components contribute significant spectral weight in k-space, impacting k-space properties such as the spin-Hall conductivity."

In particular, the disorder must be smaller than the superconducting gap for the appearance of Majorana modes, but the disorder-induced appearance of subgap Andreev-bound states suppresses the Majorana modes. We theoretically investigate, as a function of disorder, the normal state ballistic transport properties of nanowires with and without superconductors in order to provide guidance on how to experimentally estimate the level of disorder. Experimentally, the superconductivity is suppressed simply by rotating the magnetic field appropriately, so both physics can be studied in the same set-up. In particular, the presence of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting produces a helical gap in the 1D electronic band structure, which should have clear signatures in ballistic transport unless these signatures are suppressed by disorder and/or Fabry-P\\'erot resonances associated with the finite wire sizes. Our work provides a benchmarking of when and what signatures of the putative helical gap (which is essential for the emergence of Majorana modes by leading to a single Fermi surface) could manifest in realistic nanowires."

Increasing band degeneracy can effectively balance $\\sigma$ and $S$, enabling a high power factor (PF, $S^{2}\\sigma$). However, compounds with intrinsically large band degeneracy are scarce. Here, we present an unconventional strategy to realize elevated band degeneracy in zigzag-chain Na$_2$Au$X$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds by harnessing strong intra- and interchain orbital coupling. Pronounced hybridization between Au-$d_{z^{2}}$ and $X$-$p_{z}$ orbitals along the Au--$X$ zigzag chains, together with unexpectedly strong interchain $X$-$p_{x}/p_{y}$ coupling, produces a highly dispersive, multivalley valence band structure that supports an exceptional PF. Concurrently, the intrinsically weak interchain interactions arising from the quasi-one-dimensional framework, together with the weakened Au--$X$ and Au--Au bonds within the chains due to filling of $p$-$d^{*}$ antibonding states, result in an ultralow $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$. First-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory predict that $p$-type Na$_2$AuBi achieves a PF of $63.9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-2}$, an ultralow $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{L}}$ of $0.49\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and a maximum $ZT$ of $4.7$ along the zigzag-chain direction at $800\\,\\mathrm{K}$.

Carbon-based quantum dots (CQDs) are among the most common forms of luminescent nanomaterials, appealing due to their ease of synthesis, tunability through organic chemistry, high brightness, and natural biocompatibility. However, the observation of room temperature, spin-dependent PL has remained elusive. Here we report on the observation of PL modulation of CQDs by magnetic fields ($\\sim 10$ mT) under ambient conditions. We synthesize a series of CQDs using 19 different amino acids, which have a range of PL emission spectra and exhibit a clear magneto-PL effect (up to $\\sim 1$% change). Furthermore, an electron spin resonance is detected in the PL with a g-factor of g $\\approx$ 2, suggesting a process similar to the radical pair mechanism is responsible. Finally, we show that the magneto-PL contrast decreases in the presence of paramagnetic species, which we attribute to an increase in magnetic noise-induced spin relaxation in the CQDs. Our work brings new functionalities to these commonly used and biocompatible luminescent nanoparticles, opening new opportunities for in situ quantum sensing and imaging of biological samples."

      "summary": "We consider a single impurity atom trapped in a double well (DW) potential created by a dipolar two-soliton molecule in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. By solving the eigenvalue problem for the impurity atom in the DW potential, we find that its ground and first excited states are well separated from higher excited states. This allows it to be approximated by a desirable two-level quantum system. Numerical simulations of the Schr\\\"odinger equation, governing impurity atom, demonstrate periodic oscillations in the probability of finding the impurity confined either to the ``left\" or to the ``right\" side of the DW potential. An analytic expression for the coherent oscillations of the population imbalance between the two wells of the DW potential has been derived using the two-mode approximation. Theoretical predictions of the mathematical model are in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations. Potential usage of the developed setup as a physical realization of ``qubit\" has been discussed."

      "summary": "The excited electronic states involved in the optical cycle preparation of a pure spin state of the negatively charged NV-defect in diamond are calculated using the HSE06 hybrid density functional and variational optimization of the orbitals. This includes the energy of the excited triplet as well as the two lowest singlet states with respect to the ground triplet state. In addition to the vertical excitation, the effect of structural relaxation is also estimated using analytical atomic forces. The lowering of the energy in the triplet excited state and the resulting zero-phonon line triplet excitation energy are both within 0.1 eV of the experimental estimates. An analogous relaxation in the lower energy singlet state using spin purified atomic forces is estimated to be 0.06 eV. These results, obtained with a hybrid density functional, improve on previously published results using local and semi-local functionals, which are known to underestimate the band gap. The good agreement with experimental estimates demonstrates how time-independent variational calculations of excited states using density functionals can give accurate results and, thereby, provide a powerful screening tool for identifying other defect systems as candidates for quantum technologies."

      "summary": "Double cation chalcohalide have recently been emerged as the interesting candidates for sustainable energy conversion applications, owing to their intrinsic chemical tunability, suitable band gap, and low thermal conductivity. With this motivation, the current study is designed to explore the structural, electron and phonon transport mechanism, and thermoelectric properties of $CuBiSeX_{2} (X = Cl, Br)$ through density functional theory-based computations. The experimental feasibility of the compounds is ensured, and they are predicted to be thermally, dynamically, and mechanically stable. The distinct structural attributes coupled with suitable electronic band structure promotes the electron transport properties. Comprehensively, the delocalized Cu atom enhancing the phonon scattering process and the off-centred displacement of cations leading to bonding anharmonicity results ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity $(\\kappa_L)$. Among these systems, $CuBiSeCl_2$ exhibits low $\\kappa_L$ (0.24 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K) and superior thermoelectric performance (zT = 1.18 at 600 K), whereas $CuBiSeBr_2$ ($\\kappa_L$ = 0.65 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, zT = 0.68 at 600 K) demands further optimization. Overall, the study sheds light into the interplay between the Cu diffusion and bonding anisotropy in phonon propagation and establishes the potential of double-cation chalcohalides for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications."

Additionally, the statistical relationships and different correlation patterns can also differentiate between the different types of single-cell growth, such as linear and exponential. Further, we demonstrate that various population-level distributions, such as age, size, and added-size distributions, are indistinguishable across different models of cell division despite them having different division rules and correlation patterns. Moreover, this indistinguishability is robust to stochasticity in growth rate and holds for both exponential and linear growth. Finally, we show that our theoretical predictions are corroborated by simulations and supported by existing single-cell experimental data."

Colloidal transition metal dichalcogenides nanostructures are experimentally accessible and chemically tunable platforms for spintronics, deserving dedicated research to assess their potential. Here, we investigate from first principles free-standing triangular MoS2 nanoflakes with sulfur-terminated, hydrogen-passivated edges, to probe intrinsic spin behavior at varying side lengths. We find a critical edge length of approximately 1.5 nm separating nonmagnetic nanoflakes from larger ones with a magnetic ground state emerging from several, energetically competing spin configurations. In these systems, the magnetic activity is not uniformly distributed along the edges but localized on specific \"magnetic islands\" around molybdenum edge atoms. The localization of magnetic moments is robust even in non-equilateral nanoflake geometries, highlighting their intrinsic stability regardless of the (high) symmetry of the hosting structure. These findings establish that the S-terminated, H-passivated triangular MoS2 nanoflakes are a stable and experimentally accessible platform via colloidal synthesis for low-dimensional, next-generation spintronic devices."

      "summary": "Ising machines, including quantum annealing machines, are promising next-generation computers for combinatorial optimization problems. However, due to hardware limitations, most Ising-type hardware can only solve objective functions expressed in linear or quadratic terms of binary variables. Therefore, problems with higher-order terms require an order-reduction process, which increases the number of variables and constraints and may degrade solution quality. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of directly solving such problems without order reduction by using a high-performance simulated annealing-based optimization solver capable of handling polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) formulations. We compare its performance against a conventional quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) solver on the same hardware platform. As benchmarks, we use the low autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem and the vehicle routing problem with distance balancing, both of which naturally include higher-order interactions. Results show that the PUBO solver consistently achieves superior solution quality and stability compared to its QUBO counterpart, while maintaining comparable computational time and requiring no order-reduction compilation indicating potential advantages of directly handling higher-order terms in practical optimization problems."

The presented approach integrates green chemistry principles with an operator-friendly, low-cost, and practical solution for spatial and temporal pH measurement. CQDs functionalized with m-aminophenylboronic acid enable highly sensitive and reversible pH readouts through two complementary mechanisms: ratiometric monitoring of emission band intensities, and direct visual observation of colorimetric changes reflected in the CIE1931 chromaticity coordinates. The system achieves maximal sensitivities of 137 percent per pH unit and 49.5 percent per pH unit, respectively, while simultaneously maintaining high measurement resolution and full reproducibility of the readouts, placing it among the most effective CQD-based pH sensors reported to date. Here, we demonstrate the capability of 2D luminescent imaging of pH distributions, allowing for both spatially resolved and time-resolved monitoring. Employing just an excitation source, a digital camera or smartphone, and RGB channel analysis, the setup eliminates the necessity for specialized filters or sophisticated instrumentation. The combination of multimodal readout strategies with the capacity for large-area visualization establishes lignin-derived CQDs as a sustainable and practical platform for pH sensing. By simultaneously addressing the challenges of waste valorization and the demand for innovative sensing technologies, this solution fulfills the requirements of both environmentally responsible material design and next-generation pH sensor development."

However, in realistic materials where disorder scattering also contributes to nonlinear transport, identifying the geometric mechanisms remains a challenge. We find a total of 20 mechanisms of third-order nonlinear transport by developing a comprehensive theory that treats the geometric effects and disorder scattering on an equal footing. More importantly, we find that 12 of these mechanisms can be unambiguously identified, by deriving a scaling law that expresses the third-order nonlinear Hall conductivity as a polynomial in the linear longitudinal conductivity. We apply this theory to identify the geometric mechanisms of third-order nonlinear transport in materials both with and without time-reversal symmetry, such as 2D materials, topological materials, and altermagnets. This theory further promotes nonlinear transport as a probe of geometric effects and phase transitions in quantum materials."

The hybridization of the two magnon modes with photons strongly depends on the applied magnetic field: at zero magnetic field, only a single antiferromagnetic mode with a lower frequency couples to the photon, forming a magnon-polariton, while using a magnetic field activates coupling for both antiferromagnetic modes. The coupling between magnon and photon is ultrastrong with the coupling constant $\\sim$ 100 GHz exceeding 10% of the antiferromagnetic resonant frequency. The superconductor modulates the spin of the resulting magnon-polaritons and the group velocity, achieving values amounting to several tenths of the speed of light, which promises strong tunability of magnon transport in antiferromagnets by superconductors."

This anomalous hybridization effect is likely responsible for the unresolved magnetic ground state in Cd6Ce.

We have constructed a two-dimensional 12-orbital \\textit{Dirac-Anderson} model as an effective model for CeRh$_2$As$_2$. The band structure and Fermi-surface topology of the Dirac-Anderson model agree well with the ARPES data and the DFT+$U$ calculations. We show that the quantum geometry strongly favors magnetic-monopole fluctuations because of the Dirac point at the $M$ point. By solving the linearized \\'{E}liashberg equation, we demonstrate that the $B_{1u}$ and $B_{2g}$ representations, spin-triplet states originating from the Dirac point, exhibit the leading superconducting instabilities. By comparing the random-phase approximation and the fluctuation-exchange approximation, we further demonstrate that strong-correlation effects mitigate the influence of quantum geometry.

Here we demonstrate that the electronic viscosity has an enormous influence on the operation of a prototypical AC-current-driven nano-motor. The design of this prototype consists of a diatomic molecule immersed in an otherwise homogeneous electron liquid which carries an AC current. The motion of the diatomic is determined by a subtle balance between the current-induced forces and electronic friction. By ab-initio time-dependent density-functional simulations we demonstrate that the diatomic performs a continuous rotation provided the amplitude and frequency of the imposed AC current lie within certain islands of stability. Outside these islands the nuclear motion is either chaotic or comes to a stand-still. The proposed design of the nano-motor is the conceptually simplest realization of the idea of an molecular waterwheel sandwiched between conducting leads"

The proximity coupling imprints each momentum-dependent of the altermagnet spin texture onto the Dirac surface states, giving rise to an angular mass whose sign follows the lattice orientation. Adjusting the phase of one electrode redefines this mass pattern, thereby tuning the number and spatial distribution of chiral edge channels. This results in discrete conductance steps and a reversible inversion of the thermoelectric coefficient-achieved without external magnetic fields or net magnetization. A compact Dirac model captures both the quantized switching and its resilience to moderate disorder. Overall, this symmetry-driven mechanism provides a practical and low-dissipation route to programmable topological transport via lattice rotation."

      "summary": "The determination of the phase diagram of water ice under extreme conditions remains a fundamental challenge in high-pressure physics. While theoretical predictions have long suggested the existence of compact phases, such as face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures, yet only the fcc phase has been experimentally confirmed. Here, we report the first direct observation of a hcp ice phase using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Between 80 and 200 GPa, we observe the coexistence of fcc and hcp ice, arising from stacking disorder in the fcc oxygen layers, similar to phenomena seen in compressed noble gases. Above 200 GPa, the hcp phase becomes dominant and is recovered at 300 K, indicating its increased thermodynamic stability at ultrahigh pressures. These findings not only expand our understanding of water's complex behavior under extreme conditions but also may play a crucial role in the interiors of giant icy planets."

      "summary": "We study the stability of persistent currents in fermionic superfluids with impurities within the BCS regime by using time-dependent density functional theory. Unlike in Bose-Einstein condensates, we find that current stabilization by impurities is intrinsically limited by the pair-breaking threshold. Below the threshold, impurities enhance winding number stability, but pair-breaking continues to drive dissipation of the flow. Above this critical velocity, superflow destabilizes, emitting vortices. Impurities then govern vortex mobility and pinning, exhibiting regimes of collective pinning and hopping. Moreover, pinned vortices do not guarantee dissipationless flow due to ongoing pair-breaking. Our results identify pair breaking as the fundamental mechanism that sets the ultimate limit of persistent-current stability in fermionic superfluids, providing insights relevant to ultracold Fermi gases and neutron-star matter."

      "summary": "Understanding non-equilibrium spin transport through 2D ferromagnets is a theoretical challenge, as correlations produce a complex electronic structure with coexisting itinerant and localized electrons. We have developed a fully non-equilibrium ab initio method, combining density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory, and non-equilibrium Green's functions to investigate the transport in Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, a prototypical high-temperature 2D ferromagnet. We show that, while spin transport remains essentially single-particle under moderate bias, inelastic spin-dependent scattering of carriers with particle-hole excitations drives a distinctive hot-correlated electron regime beyond a critical voltage. This regime is marked by incoherent features in both the electronic spectrum and the conductance, which are experimentally accessible. Our results demonstrates that material-specific many-body non-equilibrium methods are essential for a complete understanding of spin transport in 2D ferromagnets."

      "summary": "Nanocrystalline materials are promising candidates for future fusion reactor applications, due to their high density of grain boundaries which may serve as sinks for irradiation induced defects. We use molecular dynamics to simulate collision cascades in nanocrystalline iron and compare these to collision cascades in initially defect free single crystals. We create nanocrystalline samples via Voronoi tessellation of initially randomly placed grain seeds and via severe plastic shearing. An irradiation induced annealing is observed whereby after ~ 2 displacements per atom (dpa), irradiation drives all simulation cells to a single crystalline state. Irradiation-induced defects that distort the lattice generate elastic strain, so we use excess potential energy as a measure of defect content. At low doses, the Voronoi samples feature a few large, low energy grains, whereas the sheared samples show many small, high energy grains due to the high defect and grain boundary content caused by severe deformation. As dose increases beyond 1 dpa however, all nanocrystalline samples converge to a similar behaviour. Excess potential energy mirrors this trend, plateauing above ~ 4 dpa. We hypothesise that the initially pristine cells will also reach a similar plateau after 5 dpa, which is seemingly confirmed by running a single instance of each cell type to 10 dpa. A model is developed to explain the energy evolution."

      "summary": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the influence of mechanical strain on irradiation-induced defect and dislocation evolution in nickel single crystals subjected to cumulative overlapping 5 keV collision cascades at 300 K. The simulations reveal that tensile strain modifies the dynamics of defect generation and recovery, promoting stress-assisted defect mobility and enhancing defect survival compared to the unstrained case. The heat spike duration and intensity decrease systematically with increasing strain, indicating faster energy dissipation and altered defect recombination behavior under applied stress. Analysis of the dislocation structure shows that Shockley-type partial dislocations dominate the microstructural response, while Hirth and other dislocation types remain comparatively minor. Both the total and Shockley dislocation densities reach a saturation value of $~10^{16}m^{-2}$ , marking the establishment of a steady-state microstructure governed by the balance between dislocation accumulation and recovery. The evolution of the total dislocation density with strain is successfully described by the Kocks-Mecking model, demonstrating its applicability to strain-dependent irradiation effects in metallic systems"

In this paper, we study a paradigmatic polar active dumbbell system through numerical simulations, to clarify how polar patterns and defects emerge and shape evolution. We focus on the interplay between these patterns and morphology, domain growth, irreversibility, and compressibility, tuned by dumbbell rigidity and interaction strength. Our results show that, when separated through MIPS, dumbbells with softer interactions can slide one relative to each other and compress more easily, producing blurred hexatic patterns, polarization patterns extended across entire hexatically varied domains, and stronger compression effects. Analysis of isolated domains reveals the consistent presence of inward-pointing topological defects that drive cluster compression and generate non-trivial density profiles, whose magnitude and extension are ruled by the rigidity of the pairwise potential. Investigation of entropy production reveals instead that clusters hosting an aster (spiral) defect are characterized by a flat (increasing) entropy profile mirroring the underlying polarization structure, thus suggesting an alternative avenue to distinguish topological defects on thermodynamical grounds. Overall, our study highlights how interaction strength and defect-compression interplay affect cluster evolution in particle-based active models, and also provides connections with recent studies of continuum polar active field models."

This is nowadays understood as the result of strong electron-phonon coupling leading to the formation of local multicentre dimers that arrange themselves into one-dimensional stripes. In this work, we study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of these dimers and track the time evolution of their population following an infrared photoexcitation using free-electron lased-based time-resolved X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. First, we observe that the dissolution of dimers is driven by the transfer of energy from the electronic subsystem to the lattice subsystem, in agreement with previous studies. Second, we observe a surprisingly fast relaxation of the dimer population on the timescale of a few picoseconds. By comparing our results to published ultrafast electron diffraction and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data, we reveal that the long-range order needs tens of picoseconds to recover, while the local dimer distortion recovers on a short timescale of a few picoseconds."

At low temperatures, the AFMR mode is remarkably sharp ($\\sim50$ mT for the full width at the half-maximum).

      "summary": "Supersolidity in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), which is the coexistence of crystalline density modulation and global phase coherence, emerges from the interplay of contact interactions, long-range dipole-dipole forces, and quantum fluctuations. Although realized experimentally, stabilizing this phase at zero temperature often requires high peak densities. Here we chart the finite-temperature phase behavior of a harmonically trapped dipolar BEC using an extended mean-field framework that incorporates both quantum (Lee-Huang-Yang) and thermal fluctuation effects. We find that finite temperature can act constructively: it shifts the supersolid phase boundary toward larger scattering lengths, lowers the density threshold for the onset of supersolidity, and broadens the stability window of modulated phases. Real-time simulations reveal temperature-driven pathways (crystallization upon heating and melting upon cooling) demonstrating the dynamical accessibility and path dependence of supersolid order. Moreover, moderate thermal fluctuations stabilize single-droplet states that are unstable at zero temperature, expanding the experimentally accessible parameter space. These results identify temperature as a key control parameter for engineering and stabilizing supersolid phases, offering realistic routes for their observation and control in dipolar quantum gases."

The resulting exciton bound by photon exchange, recently demonstrated experimentally, exhibits a binding energy that can be continuously tuned by varying the cavity frequency. We show that polariton-polariton interactions, originating from both Coulomb interactions and Pauli blocking, can be dramatically enhanced by reducing the exciton binding energy, thereby increasing the effective Bohr radius along the growth direction. This regime is reminiscent of Rydberg atoms, where weak binding leads to strong quantum interactions. Our predictions indicate that this physics can give rise to giant quantum optical nonlinearities in the mid and far infrared, a spectral region that remains largely unexplored in quantum optics and offers exciting opportunities for both fundamental studies and applications."

This study presents a comprehensive methodology for noise estimation and suppression in EMCD measurements, demonstrated on Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. By employing a classical three-beam geometry and long-term acquisition of electron energy-loss spectra, we systematically analyze the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across individual energy channels using bootstrap statistics. A robust energy alignment procedure based on the neighboring Ba-M4,5 edges with an adequate energy upsampling is introduced to minimize systematic errors from energy misalignment. The impact of detector noise, particularly from CMOS-based EELS cameras, is evaluated through variance-to-mean analysis and described by the noise amplification coefficients, revealing that detector-amplified shot noise is the dominant noise source. We recommend a stricter SNR threshold for reliable EMCD detection and quantification, ensuring that critical spectral features such as the Fe-L2,3 peaks meet the requirements for quantitative analysis. The approach also provides a framework for determining the minimum electron dose necessary for valid measurements and can be generalized to scintillator-based or direct electron detectors. This work advances the reliability of EMCD as a quantitative tool for magnetic characterization at the nanoscale with unknown magnetic structures. The proposed procedures lay the groundwork for improved error handling and SNR optimization in future EMCD studies."

Incorporating a physics graph informed mechanism with a generative AI model for physics exploration, we realize arbitrary, position controllable on board Anderson localization, surpassing conventional random localization.

In this study, a vHs-induced insulator-metal transition coupled with a ferromagnetic phase transition was empirically achieved in atomically designed quasi-2D SrRuO3 (SRO) superlattices via epitaxial strain engineering, which has not been observed in conventional 3D SRO systems. Theoretical calculations revealed that epitaxial strain effectively modulates the strength and energy positions of vHs of specific Ru orbitals, driving correlated phase transitions in the electronic and magnetic ground states. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the anisotropic electronic structure of quasi-2D SRO modulated by epitaxial strain. Magneto-optic Kerr effect and electrical transport measurements demonstrated modulated magnetic and electronic phases. Furthermore, magneto-electrical measurements detected significant anomalous Hall effect signals and ferromagnetic magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of magnetically coupled charge carriers in the 2D metallic regime. This study establishes strain engineering as a promising platform for tuning vHss and resultant itinerant ferromagnetism of low-dimensional correlated quantum systems."

The model involves tight-binding electrons with hopping $t$, coupled to classical spins with coupling $J'$, while the spins have a nearest neighbour coupling $J$ between them. We work with a fixed, small $J/t$, and study the temperature dependence of resistivity for varying electron density $n$ and coupling $J'/t$. Our magnetic configurations are generated by exact diagonalisation-based Langevin dynamics, while the conductivity is computed using the Kubo formula on exact eigenstates. We work on lattices of size $20 \\times 20$ and can access electron density down to $n \\sim 0.01$. The electron system remains homogeneous either when the mean density is large or when the coupling $J'$ is small. In these situations, the resistivity $\\rho(T)$ displays a monotonic increase with temperature and can be understood within a perturbative framework. However, at very low density $n \\lesssim 0.05$, strong coupling $J'/t \\gtrsim 1$, and for $T \\sim T_c$, the electrons can locally polarise the magnetic state, create a trapping potential, and form a bound state in it. The resistivity associated with this polaronic phase is distinctly non-monotonic, with a peak near $T_c$. We establish the boundary that separates the many-body polaronic window from traditional scattering and extract a universal form for the resistivity in the scattering regime. We suggest the origin of the `excess resistivity' in the polaronic regime in terms of an increasing fraction of localised states as the temperature tends to $T_c$. This pushes the mobility edge towards the chemical potential $\\mu$ and results in enhanced scattering of momentum states near $k_F$. While our specific results are in two dimensions, the phenomenology we uncover should be valid even in three dimensions."

      "summary": "Considering deterministic classical lattice systems with continuous variables, we show that, if the initial conditions are sampled according to a probability distribution in which the dynamical variables are statistically independent, the dynamical trajectory of any macroscopic observable is approximately the same for the vast majority of the states in the sample. Our proof relies on general concentration of measure results which provide tight bounds for the deviation from typical behavior in the case of large system sizes. The only condition that we assume for the dynamics is that the influence of a local perturbation in the initial state decays sufficiently fast with distance at any finite time. Our results are relevant, in particular, to classical Hamiltonian systems on a lattice. We apply our general results to a system of coupled rotors with long-range interactions, and report dynamical simulations which verify our findings."

      "summary": "Neutron irradiation produces, within a few picoseconds, displacement cascades that are sequences of atomic collisions generating point and extended defects which subsequently affects the long-term evolution of materials. The diversity of these defects, characterized morphologically and statistically, defines what is called the \"primary damage\". In this work, we present a fully unsupervised machine learning (ML) workflow that detects and classifies these defects directly from molecular dynamics data. Local environments are encoded by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) vector, anomalous atoms are isolated with autoencoder neural networks (AE), embedded with Uniform Man- ifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). Applied to 80 keV displacement cascades in Ni, Fe70Ni10Cr20, and Zr, the AE successfully identify the small fraction of outlier atoms that participate in defect formation. HDBSCAN then partitions the UMAP latent space of AE-flagged SOAP de- scriptors into well defined groups representing vacancy- and interstitial-dominated regions and, within each, separates small from large aggregates, assigning 99.7 % of outliers to compact physical motifs. A signed cluster-identification score confirms this separation, and cluster size scales with net defect counts (R2 > 0.89). Statistical cross analyses between the ML outlier map and several conventional detectors (centrosymmetry, dislocation extraction, etc.) reveal strong overlap and complementary coverage, all achieved without template or threshold tuning. This ML workflow thus provides an efficient tool for the quantitative mapping of structural anomalies in materials, particularly those arising from irradiation damage in displacement cascades."

      "summary": "Hypothesis: Bacterial contamination of surfaces poses a major threat to public health. Designing effective antibacterial or self-cleaning surfaces requires understanding how bacteria-laden droplets interact with solid substrates and how readily they can be removed. We hypothesize that bacterial motility critically influences the early-stage surface interaction (i.e., surface adhesion) of bacteria-laden droplets, which cannot be captured by conventional contact angle goniometry. Experiments: Sessile droplets containing live and dead Escherichia coli (E. coli) were studied to probe their wetting and interfacial behavior. Contact angle goniometry was used to probe dynamic wetting, while a cantilever-deflection-based method was used to quantify adhesion. Internal flow dynamics were visualized using micro-particle image velocimetry (PIV) and analyzed statistically. Complementary sliding experiments on moderately wettable substrates were performed to assess contact line mobility under tilt. Findings: Despite lower surface tension, droplets containing live bacteria exhibited lower surface adhesion forces than their dead counterparts, with adhesion further decreasing at higher bacterial concentrations. Micro-PIV revealed that flagellated live E. coli actively resist evaporation-driven capillary flow via upstream migration, while at higher concentrations, collective dynamics emerge, producing spatially coherent bacterial motion despite temporal variability. These coordinated flows disrupt passive transport and promote depinning of the contact line, thereby reducing adhesion. Sliding experiments confirmed enhanced contact line mobility and frequent stick-slip motion in live droplets, even with lower receding contact angles and higher hysteresis. These findings provide mechanistic insight into droplet retention, informing the design of self-cleaning/antifouling surfaces."

The optimization is carried out on the product-of-spheres normalization manifold and combines a manifold-preserving analytic line search, derived from a second-order energy expansion and validated along the exact normalized path, with complementary Fourier-space kinetic and real-space diagonal (Hessian-inspired) preconditioners. The method enforces monotonic energy descent and exhibits robust convergence across droplet, stripe, and supersolid regimes while retaining spectrally accurate discretizations and FFT-based evaluation of the dipolar term. In head-to-head benchmarks against imaginary-time evolution on matched grids and tolerances, the solver reduces iteration counts by one to two orders of magnitude and overall time-to-solution, and it typically attains slightly lower energies, indicating improved resilience to metastability. We reproduce representative textures and droplet-stability windows reported for dipolar mixtures. These results establish a reliable and efficient tool for large-scale parameter scans and phase-boundary mapping, and for quantitatively linking numerically obtained metastable branches to experimentally accessible states."

      "summary": "In quantum magnetic materials it is common to observe both static and dynamic lattice effects on the magnetic excitation spectrum. Less common is to find that the magnetic correlations have a significant impact on the phonon spectrum. Can such an interplay occur in a structurally soft system with comparable elastic and magnetic energy scales? Here we study the metal-organic material (C5H9NH3)2CuBr4 (Cu-CPA), in which an explanation of the low-lying excitations depends crucially on a full understanding of both the spin and lattice subsystems. We report high-resolution neutron spectroscopy enabled by large, deuterated single-crystals that reveal how both sectors are affected by the recently discovered structural phase transition. By measuring over several Brillouin zones, we disentangle the vibrational contribution to the spectrum in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the quasi-one-dimensional magnetic signal. The low-energy magnetic excitations are dominated by two gaps, $\\Delta$ b = 0.41 meV and $\\Delta$ a = 0.55 meV, which contribute with equal intensity ratios, confirming that Cu-CPA realizes a two-ladder spin Hamiltonian, and we deduce the magnetic interaction parameters of both ladders. The phonon spectrum contains a highly localized mode at an anomalously low-energy around 2 meV. This characteristic frequency drops by approximately 5 percent as magnetic correlations become established with decreasing temperature, and we connect this behavior with the location and structure of the cyclopentylammonium rings."

      "summary": "Kagome metals are an intriguing class of quantum materials as the presence of both flat bands and Dirac points provides access to functional properties present in strongly correlated and topological materials. To fully harness these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses."

The conventional wisdom is that for a high ion concentration, ions microphase separate from the polymer matrix, resulting in poor conductivity. Instead, we show that a high ion size ratio promotes better mixing of the ions with the polymer matrix. Under these conditions, the ion-dipole moment interaction dominates over the ion-ion interaction and improves the ion dispersion in the polymer matrix. The ion size ratio is thus a key to tailor the properties of these materials with immediate relevance to the development of SPEs for energy storage devices."

      "summary": "The magnetic properties of van der Waals materials are profoundly influenced by structural defects. The layered antiferromagnet MnPS3 offers a unique opportunity to explore defect-related magnetism, as Mn2+ vacancies can be generated by the intercalation of specific guest molecules. However, the effectiveness of this process in atomically thin flakes and the extent of the magnetic tunability remain unclear. Here, we show that the magnetic properties of MnPS3 can be tailored through the intercalation of different guest molecules. Notably, the insertion of four alkylammonium ions introduces different populations of Mn2+ vacancies, leading to a transition from the pristine antiferromagnetic state to more complex magnetic textures, including a ferrimagnetic state displaying a magnetic saturation of 1 uB/atom. Moreover, we show that the intercalation of few-nm-thick flakes also leads to the emergence of a ferrimagnetic response. This in-flake intercalation, which can be monitored in real time using optical microscopy, can be interrupted before completion, generating lateral heterostructures between pristine and intercalated areas. This approach opens the way to the use of partial intercalation to define regions with distinct magnetic properties within a single flake."

      "summary": "Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) describes how chiral molecules and materials generate spin polarization even at thermal equilibrium. This observation has challenged established principles of microscopic reversibility and Onsager reciprocity. We resolve this paradox by formulating a pseudo-Hermitian quantum framework in which structural chirality and electron correlations are sufficient to produce CISS observables. Chirality enters through a non-local metric that couples spin and spatial motion, leading to real spectra, unitary evolution, and thermodynamic consistency. The framework predicts a chirality-induced spin magnetic ordering characterized by a spin--displacement order $\\langle \\sigma \\cdot x \\rangle$, which reconciles equilibrium spin polarization with detailed balance and explains the persistence of CISS in materials composed of light elements. We also derive generalized Onsager-Casimir relations that respect the observed parity ($\\mathcal{P}$) and time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$) breaking, while preserving combined $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. This approach establishes a coherent foundation for equilibrium CISS and provides a route to link chemical chirality with measurable spin-to-charge conversion effects."

While intercalation-induced superconductivity has been reported in several bulk crystals, reaching a zero-resistance state in flakes remains challenging. Here, we show a simple method for enhancing the superconducting transition in tens-of-nm thick 2H-TaS2 crystals contacted by gold electrodes through in-situ intercalation. Our approach enables measuring the electrical characteristics of the same flake before and after intercalation, permitting us to precisely identify the effect of the guest species on the TaS2 transport properties. We find that the intercalation of amylamine molecules into TaS2 flakes causes a suppression of the charge density wave and an increase in the superconducting transition, with an onset temperature above 3 K. Additionally, we show that a fully developed zero-resistance state can be achieved in flakes by engineering the conditions of the chemical intercalation. Our findings pave the way for the integration of chemically tailored intercalation compounds in scalable quantum technologies."

      "summary": "Quantum Mpemba effect occurs when a quantum system, residing far away from the steady state, relaxes faster than a relatively nearer state. We look for the presence of this highly counterintuitive effect in the relaxation dynamics of the operators within the open quantum system setting. Since the operators evolve under a non-trace preserving map, the trace distance of an operator is not a monotonically decaying function of time, unlike its quantum state counterpart. Consequently, the trace distance can not serve as a reliable measure for detecting the Mpemba effect in operator dynamics. We circumvent this problem by defining a \\textit{dressed} distance between operators that decays monotonically with time, enabling a generalized framework to explore the Mpemba-like effect for operators. Applying the formalism to various open quantum system settings, we find that, interestingly, in the single qubit case, only accelerated relaxation of operators is possible, while genuine Mpemba-like effects emerge in higher-dimensional systems such as qutrits and beyond. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of Mpemba-like effects in nonlocal, non-equilibrium operators, such as current, in a double-quantum-dot setup. Our results, besides offering fundamental insight about the occurrence of the Mpemba-like effect under non-trace preserving dynamics, open avenues for new experimental studies where quicker relaxation of observables could be of significant interest."

      "summary": "Undoped Si-SiGe two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) provide an ideal platform for hosting quantum-dot spin-qubits owing enhanced spin dephasing times and compatibility with standard CMOS technology. The strained Si quantum well reduces the valley degeneracy into two closely spaced ones. The existence of a near-degenerate valley state act as a leakage channel and compromises gate fidelity. A robust and uniform valley splitting across the entire chip is crucial for achieving scalability in the architecture and reliability in operation. Imperfections such as broadened interfaces, alloy disorders and atomic steps significantly compromise the valley splitting. The associated scattering mechanisms play detrimental roles in the performance of the qubits. In this manuscript, exploiting low-temperature magnetotransport measurements, we investigate the scattering mechanisms and valley splitting in a high-mobility undoped Si-SiGe 2DEG. At lower carrier densities, transport is limited by remote impurity scattering, whereas at higher densities, background impurity scattering near the quantum well dominates. Both the transport and quantum lifetimes of the charge carriers increase with carrier concentration, due to the enhancement in the impurity screening. Magnetic-field-induced confinement effect also is found to improve the valley splitting. Current-biasing measurements reveals the role of carrier heating in the visibility of valley splitting and reveal a temperature limited valley splitting of approximately 100 micro-eV. These results provide critical insight into scattering-dominated regimes and valley splitting in undoped Si-SiGe, advancing its potential for silicon-based quantum devices."

      "summary": "This study examines the tribological behavior of diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings doped with silicon (Si), cobalt (Co), or silver (Ag) in the presence of an amine-functionalized block copolymer lubricant. Under boundary lubrication, Si-doped DLC (Si-DLC) exhibited the lowest coefficient of friction ($\\approx$0.045) and nearly 45% lower wear than undoped DLC. Co-DLC showed moderate improvement, while Ag-DLC provided no significant benefit. Cross-sectional FIB-TEM revealed thin tribofilms, 12-17 nm in thickness, on Si- and Co-doped surfaces. As reported for Si-DLC, these films incorporate copolymer-derived fragments, suggesting a similar composition for Co-DLC. These results indicate that dopant-polymer interactions are key to the development of self-organized boundary layers. To gain atomic-level insight, first-principles calculations were carried out on the adsorption of the dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) unit, the copolymer's functional group. The calculated adsorption energies were $-$2.27 to $-$0.57 eV for Si-DLC, $-$1.73 to $-$1.49 eV for Co(0001), and $-$1.21 to $-$1.08 eV for Ag(111). The order of stability (Si $>$ Co $>$ Ag) was consistent with the experimental tribological ranking. Chemical bonding dominated for Si-DLC, while Ag showed mainly weak physisorption. Simulated pull-off forces further reflected this hierarchy, with N-Si bonds requiring about twice the force of N-Co and nearly five times that of N-Ag. The correspondence between adsorption strength and tribological response highlights the decisive role of dopant species in tribofilm formation. These findings provide guidance for designing durable low-friction surfaces in applications such as electric drivetrains and precision mechanical systems."

We demonstrate its potential by estimating crosstalk effects between gate electrodes and applying these estimates to construct virtual gates in a quantum dot device.

All investigated 2D GeO2 polymorphs exhibit ultra-wide band gaps and strong excitonic effects, with flat O-p-derived valence bands tunable under strain. These features allow the design of flat band materials with ultra large electronic gaps in low-dimensional systems, making these materials promising for devices operation at higher voltages and temperatures than conventional semiconductor materials."

Near-infrared light in the ladder plane drives a symmetry-protected electronic metastable state together with a partial melting of the equilibrium charge order. Our time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering measurements at the upper Hubbard band reveal a gapless collective excitation dispersing from the charge-order wavevector up to 0.8 eV with a slope on the order of the quasiparticle velocity. These findings reveal a regime where correlated carriers acquire itinerant character at finite momentum, and charge order becomes dynamically fluctuating, offering a platform to explore light-induced pairing instabilities."

      "summary": "The electron phonon coupling of a defect characterized by its Huang Rhys (HR) factor is a crucial metric determining its excited-state dynamics, relevant to defect applications as qubits and quantum emitters. However, HR factors remain challenging to calculate from first principles, complicated by convergence issues in excited-state relaxation and time consuming phonon calculations. Even when calculated, HR factors lack a rational design principle. Here we show that an orbital-based descriptor can be used to rationalize and efficiently estimate HR factors. Combining this descriptor with a ground state deformation technique allows circumventing both excited state relaxation and full phonon calculations. Specifically, our descriptor for HR factors is constructed using bonding character differences obtained from ground state density functional theory, measured using crystal orbital Hamilton populations. We demonstrate this descriptor for prototypical hBN defects and the diamond NV center. This orbital-based descriptor can be potentially used in high throughput computational screening to identify ideal candidates of spin qubits and SPEs."

Focusing on the Heisenberg chain in a deterministic Aubry-Andr\\'{e} potential, we complement standard diagnostics by analyzing the structure of long-distance pairwise correlations at high energy. Contrary to the expectation that the ergodic-MBL transition in quasiperiodic systems should be sharper due to the absence of Griffiths regions, we uncover a broad unconventional regime at strong quasiperiodic potential, characterized by fat-tailed distributions of longitudinal correlations at long distance. This reveals the presence of atypical eigenstates with strong long-range correlations in a regime where standard diagnostics indicate stable MBL. We further identify these anomalous eigenstates as quasi-degenerate pairs of resonant cat states, which exhibit entanglement at long distance. These findings advance the understanding of quasiperiodic MBL and identify density-correlation measurements in ultracold atomic systems as a probe of long-range resonances."

      "summary": "Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex."

Here we investigate the effects of particle-hole fluctuations on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in two-dimensional Fermi gases throughout the entire BCS-BEC crossover. We include self-consistently in the self energy treatment the entire particle-hole $T$ matrix, which constitutes a renormalization of the bare interaction that appears in the particle-particle scattering $T$ matrix, leading to a screening of the pairing interaction and hence a dramatic reduction of the pairing gap and the transition temperature. The BKT transition temperature $T_\\text{BKT}$ is determined by the critical phase space density, for which the pair density and pair mass are determined using a pairing fluctuation theory, which accommodates self-consistently the important self-energy feedback in the treatment of finite-momentum pairing fluctuations. The screening strength varies continuously from its maximum in the BCS limit to essentially zero in BEC limit. In the unitary regime, it leads to an interaction-dependent shift of $T_\\text{BKT}$ towards the BEC regime. This shift is crucial in an attempt to explain experimental data quantitatively, which often depends on the interaction strength. Our findings are consistent with available experimental results in the unitary and BEC regimes and with quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the BCS and unitary regimes."

Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron'' bound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by being off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware from superconducting qubits to trapped ions."

Yet, their physical properties often differ from those of true planetary soil, particularly when compared to regolith properties in-situ, that experience notably reduced gravity. We focus on lunar regolith simulants and explore various techniques to modify existing simulants to replicate the mechanical/rheological behavior of Moon regolith in true lunar conditions. Our results are validated against data from in-situ tests conducted during the Luna and Apollo missions, enabling a direct comparison of physical properties of our enhanced simulants to true Lunar regolith, on the Moon. Analyzed in the Mohr-Coulomb model framework, the friction angle of most simulants is generally close to that of true regolith, but the measured cohesion is often higher on the Moon, notably due to the reduced gravity environment. We propose a method to increase the cohesion of an existing simulant and assess the mechanical behavior of our rheological regolith simulant using a standardized geotechnical, shear test. The experimental results are then directly compared to in-situ data, providing a quantitative basis for evaluating the fidelity of the enhanced simulants."

      "summary": "It was recently established that the paradigmatic Gross--Neveu model with $N$ copies of two-dimensional Dirac fermions features an $\\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ symmetry if certain interactions are suppressed. This becomes evident when the theory is rewritten in terms of $2N$ copies of two-dimensional Majorana fermions. Mean-field theory for the $\\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ model predicts, besides the chiral Ising transition at $g_{c1}$, a second critical point $g_{c2}$ where $\\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ is broken down to $\\mathrm{SO}(N)\\times\\mathrm{SO}(N)$. A subsequent Wilsonian renormalization group analysis directly in $d=3$ supports its existence in a generalized theory, where $N_f$ copies of the $4N$-component Majorana fermions are introduced. This allows to track the evolution of a (i) quantum anomalous Hall Gross--Neveu--Ising, (ii) symmetric-tensor, and (iii) adjoint-nematic fixed point separately. However, it turns out that (ii) and (iii) lose their criticality when approaching $N_f = 1$, suggesting that the transition is first order. In this work, we approach the problem from the lower-critical dimension of two. We construct a Fierz-complete renormalizable Lagrangian, compute the leading order $\\beta$ functions, fermion anomalous dimension, as well as the order parameter anomalous dimensions, and resolve the three universality classes corresponding to (i)--(iii). Before becoming equal to the Gaussian fixed point at $N_f = 1$, (ii) remains critical for all values of $N_f > N_{f,c}^{\\mathrm{ST}}(N) \\approx 0.56 + 1.48 N +\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$, which compares well with the estimate of previous studies. We further find that (iii) becomes equal to (i) when approaching $N_f = 1$. An instability is, however, only present in the susceptibility corresponding to the Gross--Neveu--Ising order parameter."

This capability is particularly relevant for active photonic circuits that generate quantum light directly on-chip. Here, we explore topological effects on photon-pair generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nonlinear waveguide arrays, both theoretically and experimentally. A systematic comparison of homogeneous, trivial, and topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger arrays reveals that only the topological configuration preserves a stable SPDC resonance spectrum under disorder in the tunnel couplings, with fluctuations in the resonance position reduced by more than one order of magnitude. An analytical model supports our experimental observations by linking this robustness to the band-structure properties of the interacting modes. These findings establish quadratic nonlinear waveguide arrays as a promising platform to explore the interplay of nonlinearity, topology, and disorder in quantum photonic circuits."

For instance, recent developments in hyperbolic band theory have unveiled the emergence of higher-dimensional eigenstates -- features fundamentally absent in conventional Euclidean systems. At the same time, superconducting quantum circuits have emerged as a leading platform for quantum analogue emulations and digital simulations in scalable architectures. Here, we introduce a scalable superconducting circuit framework for the analogue quantum emulation of tight-binding models on hyperbolic and kagome-like lattices. Using this approach, we experimentally realize three distinct lattices, including, for the first time to our knowledge, a hyperbolic lattice whose unit cell resides on a genus-3 Riemann surface. Our method encodes the hyperbolic metric directly into capacitive couplings between high-quality superconducting resonators, enabling tenable reproduction of spectral and localization properties while overcoming major scalability and spectral resolution limitations of previous designs. These results set the stage for large-scale experimental studies of hyperbolic materials in condensed matter physics and lay the groundwork for realizing hyperbolic quantum processors, with potential implications for both fundamental physics and quantum computing"

      "summary": "Peristalsis is the driving mechanism behind a broad array of biological and engineered flows. In peristaltic pumping, a wave-like contraction of the tube wall produces local changes in volume which induce flow. Net flow arises due to geometric nonlinearities in the momentum equation, which must be properly captured to compute the flow accurately. While most previous models focus on radius-imposed peristalsis, they often neglect longitudinal length changes - a natural consequence of radial contraction in elastic materials. In this paper, to capture a more accurate picture of peristaltic pumping, we calculate the flow in an elastic vessel undergoing contractions in the transverse and longitudinal directions simultaneously, keeping the geometric nonlinearities arising in the strain. A careful analysis requires us to study our fluid using the Lagrangian coordinates of the elastic tube. We perform analytic calculations of the flow characteristics by studying the fluid inside a fixed boundary with time-dependent metric. This mathematical manipulation works even for large-amplitude contractions, as we confirm by comparing our analytical results to COMSOL simulations. We demonstrate that transverse and longitudinal contractions induce instantaneous flows at the same order in wall strain, but in opposite directions. We investigate the influence of the wall's Poisson ratio on the flow profile. Incompressible walls suppress flow by minimizing local volume changes, whereas auxetic walls enhance flow. For radius-imposed peristaltic waves, wall incompressibility reduces both reflux and particle trapping. In contrast, length-imposed waves typically generate backflow, although trapping can still occur at large amplitudes for some Poisson ratios. These results yield a more complete description of peristalsis in elastic media and offer a framework for studying contraction-induced flows more broadly."

XPS analysis revealed significant energy shifts (-1.5 to -1.8 eV) and broadening of the PE lines for all atoms upon polymerization, indicating a major redistribution of valence electron density between the monomer fragments. In the oxidized polymer, new features in the Ni 2p and O 1s PE spectra were associated with the formation of polarons with weakened Ni-O bonds; this effect diminished upon reduction as the number of polarons decreased. Quantum-chemical calculations attributed the valence band broadening to enhanced C 2p contributions from $\\pi$-conjugation between monomers. NEXAFS spectroscopy confirmed the stability of the ethylenediamine fragment and the direct involvement of the phenolic rings of the salen ligand in polymerization, also revealing a partial weakening and incomplete restoration of the $\\pi$ bonding between O and Ni atoms upon reduction.

      "summary": "We demonstrate the possibility of a genuine quantum advantage in the efficiency of quantum batteries by analyzing a model that enables a consistent comparison between quantum and classical regimes. Our system consists of $N$ harmonic oscillator cells coupled to a common thermal reservoir, evolving through Gaussian states. We define the global efficiency as the ratio of extractable work (ergotropy) to stored energy, and derive analytical bounds that distinguish, in order of increasing efficiency, regimes characterized by classical squeezing, quantum squeezing without entanglement, and genuine entanglement. Moreover, numerical simulations support the emergence of a similar hierarchy for the thermodynamic efficiency, defined as the ratio between ergotropy and the total thermodynamic cost of the charging process."

      "summary": "A detailed convex analysis-based formulation of density-functional theory for periodic systems in arbitrary dimensions is presented. The electron-electron interaction is taken to be of Yukawa type, harmonising with underlying function spaces for densities and wave functions. Moreau--Yosida regularisation of the underlying non-interacting density functionals is then considered, allowing us to recast the Hohenberg--Kohn mapping in a form that is insensitive to perturbations (non-expansiveness) and lends itself to numerical implementation. The general theory is exemplified with a numerical Hartree--Fock implementation for one-dimensional systems. We discuss in particular the challenge of self-consistent field optimisation in calculations related to the regularised noninteracting Hohenberg--Kohn map. The implementation is used to demonstrate that it is practically feasible to recover local Kohn--Sham potentials reproducing the effects of exact exchange within this scheme, which provides a proof-of-principle for recovering the exchange-correlation potential at more accurate levels of theory. Error analysis is performed for the regularised inverse Kohn--Sham algorithm by quantifying, both theoretically and numerically, how perturbations of the input ground-state density propagate through the regularised density-to-potential map."

I then discuss a $\\mathrm{U}(1)_A$-breaking scenario characterized by a power-law divergent spectral peak tending to $O(m^4)/|\\lambda|$ in the chiral limit and by a near-zero mobility edge, and argue that the mixing of the approximate zero modes associated with a dilute gas of topological objects provides a concrete physical mechanism producing the required spectral features, and so a viable mechanism for effective $\\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase of a gauge theory."

The mechanisms enabling such generalization remain poorly understood, despite their importance to predict ecological robustness, drug resistance, or design future-proof vaccination strategies. Here, we demonstrate that annealed population heterogeneity, wherein distinct individuals in the population experience different instances of a complex environment over time, can act as a form of implicit regularization and facilitate evolutionary generalization. Mathematically, annealed heterogeneity introduces a variance-weighted demographic noise term that penalizes across-environment fitness variance and effectively rescales the population size, thereby biasing evolution toward generalist solutions. This process is indeed analogous to a variant of the mini-batching strategy employed in stochastic gradient descent, where an effective multiplicative noise produces an inductive bias by triggering noise-induced transitions. Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis we discuss the conditions under which variation in how individuals experience environmental selection can naturally promote evolutionary strategies that generalize across environments and anticipate novel challenges."

      "summary": "For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through model's \"specialisation\" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it."

In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates.These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians.Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS."

      "summary": "Many driven systems alternate between bursts of activity and quiescence and can become trapped in an absorbing state, such as complete inactivity in reaction-diffusion processes or extinction in predator-prey dynamics. It is generally assumed that, conditioned on survival, their long-lived (quasi-stationary) behavior is unique and independent of the initial condition. We show this need not hold, even for memoryless Markov dynamics. When the configuration space fractures into multiple macroscopic communicating classes, where configurations can be reach from one another within a class but not across classes, the system retains a measurable memory of its preparation, which can directly affect the critical exponents near absorbing transitions. Using a minimal birth-death-diffusion model, we demonstrate that the quasi-stationary state is unique when birth processes are present, but becomes nonunique and initial-condition dependent when they are suppressed. This mechanism, arising from vanishing of inter-class escape-rate ratios in thermodynamic limit, challenges the conventional universality hypothesis and suggests possibility of history-dependent critical scaling in controlled lattice or colloidal systems with tunable particle-number."

The setting we consider is that of a quantum quench. We find a remarkably rich phenomenology, ranging from stable periodic signals to ones decaying with varying rates. This variety is due to a complex interplay of constraints on thermalization imposed by integrability and symmetry. A process we term dynamical domain wall relocalization provides a long-lived signal in the clean, integrable case, which can be degraded by the addition of disorder even without interactions. Our results shed light on a proposal to use an OTOC as a dynamical diagnostic of a quantum phase more powerful than a standard observable."

      "summary": "Due to the large-period superlattices emerging in moire two-dimensional (2D) materials, electronic states in such systems exhibit low energy flat bands that can be used to simulate strongly correlated physics in a highly tunable setup. While many investigations have thus far focused on moire flat bands and emergent correlated electron physics in triangular, honeycomb and quasi-one-dimensional lattices, tunable moire realizations of square lattices subject to strong correlations remain elusive. Here we propose a feasible scheme to construct moire square lattice systems by twisting two or more layers of 2D materials in a rectangular lattice by 90 degrees. We demonstrate the concept with twisted GeX/SnX (X=S, Se) moire superlattices and calculate their electronic structures from first principles. We show that the lowest conduction flat band in these systems can be described by a square lattice Hubbard model with parameters which can be controlled by varying the choice of host materials, number of layers, and external electric fields. In particular, twisted double bilayer GeSe realizes a square lattice Hubbard model with strong frustration due to the next nearest neighbour hopping that could host unconventional superconductivity{, in close analogy to the Hubbard model for copper-oxygen planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors}. The presented scheme uses 90-degree twisted 2D materials with rectangular unit cells as a promising platform for realizing the physical phenomena of square lattice Hubbard models, establishing a new route for studying its rich phase diagram of magnetism, charge order, and unconventional superconductivity in a highly tunable setting."

The phases are so-named because each realises one of the competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\\mathfrak{\\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.

      "summary": "Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on somewhat ambiguous approximations, the two major ones being: i) the definition of the QM and MM regions as well as the description of their coupling, and ii) the choice of the methods and levels of approximation made to describe each region. This paper addresses the second point and develop an exact theoretical framework that allows us to clarify the approximations involved in the QM/cDFT formulation. We establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum-classical systems within the canonical ensemble. We start by recalling the expression of the adiabatic equilibrium density matrix for a mixed system made of Nqm quantum and Nmm classical particles. Then, we propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full, non-equilibrium, QM/MM density matrix. Taking advantage of permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the quantum and classical one-body densities.This paper generalizes both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) to QM/MM systems. We then reformulate the functional to make the standard eDFT and cDFT Levy-Lieb functionals explicitly appear, together with a new universal correlation functional for QM/MM systems. A mean-field approximation is finally introduced in the context of solvation problems and we discuss its connection with several existing mixed cDFT-eDFT schemes. An extension to the semi-grand canonical ensemble, where the number of classical particles is allowed to fluctuate, is provided in the supplementary materials."

In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors."

      "summary": "We present a theoretical and numerical investigation of the role of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in shaping spin-wave (SW) dynamics under low magnetic fields in thin and ultrathin magnetic films. PMA introduces an in-plane torque that counteracts exchange, dipolar, and Zeeman contributions, fundamentally modifying SW dispersion and inducing a local minimum that, under specific conditions, becomes the lowest frequency across all geometric configurations. This results in a sombrero-shaped dispersion in ultrathin films and a cowboy-hat-like shape in thicker films, where dipolar interactions dominate. Using isofrequency contour (IFC) analysis, we demonstrate that these PMA-induced dispersion shapes enable nontrivial wave phenomena unprecedented in uniform media: bireflection and negative reflection in ultrathin films, and trireflection in thicker films--where a single incident beam splits into three reflected components, two with negative angles. Most remarkably, we predict and demonstrate tri-refraction, where one incident beam generates three refracted beams with two exhibiting negative refraction angles. We further show anti-Larmor precession of magnetization near the dispersion minimum in thicker films, arising from the interplay between PMA-induced and dipolar torques. Systematic simulations across diverse material systems--metallic films, ferrimagnetic garnets, hybrid structures, and multilayers--confirm the universal nature of these phenomena in any PMA system supporting stripe domain transitions. These results open new opportunities to explore wave phenomena beyond magnonics."

Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly computing time-dependent single-particle spectral functions using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS). We study interacting metallic and correlated insulating phases in a chain of correlated spinless fermions. At high-frequency driving we obtain clearly separated, long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum. However, if there is significant overlap of the features, which is more probable in the low-frequency regime, the interactions lead to strong heating, which results in a significant loss of quantum coherence and of the FBs. Similar suppression of FBs is obtained in the presence of noise. The emerging picture is further elucidated by the behavior of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements."

      "summary": "Adsorption breakthrough modeling often requires complex software environments and scripting, limiting accessibility for many practitioners. We present AIM, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that streamlines fixed-bed adsorption modeling and analysis through an integrated workflow, which includes isotherm fitting, estimation of the enthalpy of adsorption, prediction of mixture behavior, and multicomponent breakthrough simulations. AIM supports 13 isotherm models for isotherm fitting and includes the implementation of Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) (FastIAS) and extended Langmuir models for predicting mixture isotherms. Moreover, the isotherm models can be used to run non-isothermal breakthrough simulations along with isosteric enthalpies of adsorption from the Clausius-Clapeyron and Virial equations. Users can export detailed column and outlet profiles (e.g., composition, temperature) in multiple formats, enhancing reproducibility and data sharing among practitioners. We compared the breakthrough simulation results from the AIM workflow and compared that with the experimental data in the literature for a ternary gas mixture (CO2/H2/N2) and found excellent agreement for outlet compositions and temperature profiles."

      "summary": "We report an unexpected trans-proximate interlayer correlation (stronger correlation between disjoint layers than the adjacent ones) in the high-pressure phase of the recently discovered La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ superconductors. Accompanied by an unusual pressure-induced fractionalization of Ni$^{2+}$ ionic spin from the standard spin-1 to spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$, this trans-proximate correlation results from the emergence of a cross-layer trimer in our multi-energy-scale derivation of the electron dynamics. The resulting low-energy effective description resembles that of the cuprates and suggests a universal superconducting mechanism in all existing nickelate and cuprate superconductors. The rare trans-proximate correlation not only explains the weaker superconductivity in comparison with the related La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples, but it also indicates a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate by lowering layer symmetry. Such pressure-induced trans-proximate correlation is expected in many materials and examplifies the engineering of rich uncharted quantum states of matter through pressure."

While the stationary-state storage capacity has been investigated, its dynamical properties have not yet been discussed. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics using an exact approach based on generating functional analysis. We show results on convergence properties of memory retrieval, such as the convergence time and the size of the attraction basins. Our analysis enables a quantitative evaluation of the convergence time and the storage capacity of dense associative memory, which is useful for model design. Unlike the traditional Hopfield model, the retrieval of a pattern does not act as additional noise to itself, suggesting that the structure of modern networks makes recall more robust. Furthermore, the methodology addressed here can be applied to other energy-based models, and thus has the potential to contribute to the design of future architectures."

We demonstrate a machine learning approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from a single image of an \\emph{in situ} imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates {some} zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating the temperature (although not the chemical potential) for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems."

In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing."

      "summary": "Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are bound midgap topological excitations at the ends of a 1D topological superconductor, which must come in pairs. If the two MZMs in the pair are sufficiently well-separated by a distance much larger than their individual localization lengths, then the MZMs behave as non-Abelian anyons which can be braided to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap is exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus enabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap. In real experimental samples, however, the existence of disorder and the finite length of the 1D wire considerably complicate the situation, leading to ambiguities in defining `topology' since the Majorana splitting between the two end modes may not necessarily be small in disordered wires of short length. We theoretically study this situation by calculating the splitting in experimentally relevant short disordered wires, and explicitly investigating the applicability of the `exponential protection' constraint as a function of disorder, wire length, and other system parameters in realistic models of nanowires currently being used experimentally. We find that the exponential regime is highly constrained, and is suppressed for disorder somewhat less than the topological superconducting gap. We provide detailed results and discuss the implications of our theory for the currently active experimental search for MZMs in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platforms. A general consequence of our work is that `topology' in finite disordered wires may not be uniquely defined, necessitating a careful analysis which depends on the context."

In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect, wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium. We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial states."

The formulation provides a covariant description of systems far from equilibrium, where entropy may transiently decrease as a result of reversible circulations or exchanges with the surroundings, extending the applicability of conventional thermodynamic formalisms. As an illustrative example, a triangular chemical reaction system is analyzed. It is shown that, without assuming detailed balance or linearity, two geometric structures that behave as conserved quantities in the reversible limit naturally emerge: one associated with cyclic symmetry in the reaction space, and another that vanishes under symmetric reaction rates. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified and covariant formulation for describing both cyclic dynamics and dissipative processes within a single theoretical structure."

Using BaIrO3 as a model system, whose ground state is intricately dictated by the trimer lattice, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic and magnetically suppressed phases inaccessible via conventional methods. These effects include a 0.85% reduction in unit cell, 4-order-of-magnitude decrease in resistivity, a 10-fold enhancement of the Sommerfeld coefficient, and the collapse of long-range magnetic order -- all intrinsic and bulk in origin. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized structure lies substantially above the ground state in energy, highlighting its metastable character. These large, coherent and correlated changes across multiple bulk properties, unlike those caused by dilute impurities, defects or off-stoichiometry, point to an intrinsic field-induced mechanism. The findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials."

However, achieving precise and efficient control over spin-wave chirality remains a challenge. Here, we propose a mechanism to switch the chirality of spin waves in altermagnets via electrically induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which is free of tuning external fields. For in-plane spin polarization, SOC introduces a splitting effect opposite to the altermagnetism, leading to spin inversion in the electronic energy bands and chirality reversal in the spin-wave dispersion. By tuning SOC strength, the chirality splitting of spin waves can be controllably modified, enabling chirality switching at fixed resonance conditions, which results in the reversal of transverse spin susceptibility. We further design an experimental setup based on an altermagnet/antiferromagnet heterostructure to realize this mechanism. Our work establish a pathway toward efficient electrical control of spin-wave chirality in altermagnets, facilitating the development of chirality-based spintronic devices."

Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases, electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions, establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability under electronic current."

      "summary": "This study investigates the potential impact of intramolecular excitations on the active regions of biomolecular chains, which may play a role in physiological processes within living cells. We assumed that an excitation localized in a specific chain segment can modify its physical properties (e.g., local charge distribution or electric dipole moments), thereby altering its role in biochemical processes. As a consequence, the biochemical functionality of the molecular chain may be altered, or even disrupted. Moreover, quantum resonance effects may cause an excitation induced at one structural element to delocalize and appear at a distant site, potentially affecting the functionality of regions located far from the site where the excitation was initially induced. To investigate this phenomenon, we developed and analyzed a theoretical model in which a single excitation is induced in a particular structural element of a finite molecular chain in thermal equilibrium with its environment. The interaction between the excitation and the thermal oscillations of the chain was taken into account. Differential equations for the correlation functions were derived and solved analytically using integral transformations, providing information on the probability of finding the excitation at each site of the chain. The results show that both the probability of finding the excitation at distant sites and its residence time depend on the chain's physical characteristics, temperature, and initial excitation location."

      "summary": "We introduce a neural-network-assisted Boltzmann framework that learns the binary-collision map of microswimmers directly from data and uses it to evaluate collision integrals efficiently. Using a representative model swimmer, the learned map quantitatively predicts translational and rotational diffusivities and enables a linear-stability analysis of isotropy against polar ordering in dilute suspensions. The resulting predictions closely match direct simulations. The present framework is agnostic to active matter models and broadly applicable: once two-body collision data are obtained -- either from simulations or experiments -- the same surrogate can be used to evaluate kinetic transport across dilute conditions where binary collisions dominate. Because the workflow relies only on pre- and post-collision statistics, the present approach provides a general data-driven route linking particle-scale interactions to macroscopic transport and collective behavior in active suspensions."

      "summary": "Machine learning has accelerated materials discovery, yet most high-performing models remain black boxes, offering predictions without physical understanding. Here I present GoodRegressor, a general-purpose, C++-based symbolic regression framework that bridges data-driven modeling and physical interpretability. GoodRegressor systematically explores nonlinear transformations and feature interactions across five integrated modules, parser, designer, curator, regressor, and designer as a post-process, to construct compact, physics-consistent analytical models. For example, applied to the experimental activation energy dataset of oxygen-ion conductors, GoodRegressor explored an ensemble-sampled model space comprising approximately $1.44 \\times 10^{457}$ possible combinations and achieved superior predictive performance ($\\langle R^2 \\rangle =0.804$) compared with conventional machine learning methods, outperforming RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge, MLP, and PySR ($\\langle R^2 \\rangle \\leq 0.652$). Unlike black-box models, GoodRegressor reveals transparent structure-property relationships linking ionic transport to coordination environment and lattice flexibility. This interpretable modeling framework mitigates the opacity of conventional ML, enabling hypothesis generation, physical insight, and general applicability to complex scientific systems beyond materials informatics."

      "summary": "Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a >10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials."

      "summary": "Altermagnetism has been widely explored in 3D and 2D crystals, but its one-dimensional realization remains largely unexplored. Here we propose an altermagnetic nanotube formed by rolling a 2D altermagnet, which converts momentum-odd spin polarization into spin-chirality locking enforced by the screw axis. Unlike curvature-induced magnetization in bent films, the nanotube is mirror-antisymmetric and produce no net magnetization. Two reciprocal effects emerge: (i) a single-spin injection drives a helical current whose handedness is fixed by the spin, yielding opposite-sign axial magnetic fields; and (ii) a time-varying axial flux generates a circumferential Faraday field that drives equal-magnitude but opposite axial charge currents in the two spin channels, producing a pure spin current under open-circuit conditions. As an implication, spin accumulation programs the tube's handedness and can imprint it onto otherwise achiral coaxial nanotubes in one-dimensional van der Waals assemblies. First-principles results for V2Se2O confirm spin-dependent helical wave functions near both band edges, establishing a nonrelativistic route to spin-programmable chiral nanodevices and compact flux generators/charge-neutral spin injectors without static magnetic bias."

Even for a smooth barrier potential, backscattering induces Friedel oscillations that, via electron interactions, generate a singular correction to the conductance. This correction is maximized when the channel is half-open, resulting in a reduction of conductance. In addition, a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis modifies the single-particle spectrum, resulting in conductance oscillations via Fabry-P\\'erot-type interference, as well as a non-monotonic field dependence of the anomaly. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which interactions modify the conductance of an ideal partially open channel and offer a possible explanation for the anomalous features observed in experiments."

The gauge theory obtained by gauging fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction between the recently proposed Kramers--Wannier dualities and those obtained by gauging the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry along a space-covering path.

However, leading cathode materials such as Li-rich oxides, including Li$_2$MnO$_3$, suffer from capacity loss due to irreversible oxygen release and structural degradation, both consequences of the oxygen redox activity that also enables their high capacity. The atomic-scale mechanisms behind this degradation, and whether it can be made reversible, remain open questions. Here, using submicrosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy, we directly visualize the entire charge-discharge cycle of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, uncovering the full lifecycle of the O$_2$-filled nanovoids responsible for degradation and identifying the critical size limit for voids to remain fully repairable upon discharge. Our results reveal that the topology of the Mn cation network is the key factor governing void growth, coalescence, and reparability. Based on a structural topology-informed design principle, we computationally develop a novel Li$_2$MnO$_3$ structure featuring a Mn lattice with a Kagome-like pattern, demonstrating full electrochemical reversibility even under extreme 80% delithiation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-energy cathodes, shifting the focus from mitigating damage to engineering inherent stability through atomic-level topological control of transition metal network."

Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices."

      "summary": "The study of complex many-body systems via analysis of the trajectories of the units that dynamically move and interact within them is a non-trivial task. The workflow for extracting meaningful information from the raw trajectory data is often composed of a series of interconnected steps, such as, (i) identifying and tracking the constitutive objects/particles, resolving their trajectories (e.g., in experimental cases, where these are not automatically available as in typical molecular simulations), (ii) translating the trajectories into data that are easier to handle/analyze by using well suited descriptors, and (iii) extracting meaningful information from such data. Each of these different tasks often requires non-negligible programming skills, the use of various types of representations or methods, and the availability/development of an interface between them. Despite the considerable potential that new tools contributed to each of these individual steps, their integration under a common framework would decrease the barrier to usage (especially by diverse communities of users), avoid fragmentation, and ultimately facilitate the development of new approaches in data analysis. To this end, here we introduce dynsight, an open Python platform that streamlines the extraction and analysis of time-series data from simulation - or experimentally - resolved trajectories. dynsight simplifies workflows, enhances accessibility, and facilitates time-series and trajectories data analysis offering a useful tool to unraveling the dynamic complexity of a variety of systems (or signals) across different scales. dynsight is open source (https://github.com/GMPavanLab/dynsight) and can be easily installed using pip."

Here we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in ref. [6], on an array of superconducting qubits.

Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter."

However, in many applications, data is sparse, severely limiting their accuracy and applicability. To improve predictions, techniques such as transfer learning and multitask learning have been used. The performance of multitask learning models depends on the strength of the underlying correlations between tasks and the completeness of the data set. Standard multitask models tend to underperform when trained on sparse data sets with weakly correlated properties. To address this gap, we fuse deep-learned embeddings generated by independent pretrained single-task models, resulting in a multitask model that inherits rich, property-specific representations. By reusing (rather than retraining) these embeddings, the resulting fused model outperforms standard multitask models and can be extended with fewer trainable parameters. We demonstrate this technique on a widely used benchmark data set of quantum chemistry data for small molecules as well as a newly compiled sparse data set of experimental data collected from literature and our own quantum chemistry and thermochemical calculations."

A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\\tau_\\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\\tau_\\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\\tau_\\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\\tau_\\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian anyon type. Furthermore, we use Bayesian inference to obtain a statistical mechanics model for fixed-point non-Abelian TOs with perfect measurements under any noise model, which yields the optimal threshold conditioned on measuring anyon syndromes. We numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \\cong \\mathbb Z_4 \\rtimes \\mathbb Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome measurement, we find a conditioned optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$. Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault tolerance."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\\lambda_L = 2\\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\\lambda_K = \\lambda_L$ and $\\lambda_K = \\lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\\lambda_L \\leq \\lambda_K \\leq 2\\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages."

SPIMs have been held back fundamentally by limited computational accuracy. This study overcomes that limitation through a hybrid approach, integrating aberration correction with a dynamic algorithm to update simultaneously a number of flipped spins, rather than just one. The method demonstrably improves computational accuracy and presents a way for SPIMs to scale to significantly larger systems (order 10 5 spins), a milestone on the path to practical application.

JTWPAs with periodic modulation are attractive, as they phase match without flux or dc bias, but they often suffer from significant gain ripples. Another common limitation in JTWPAs is intrinsic loss, which has prevented them from reaching the quantum limit of added noise. Here researchers address both issues by implementing an all-aluminum coplanar lumped-element JTWPA, using a qubit-compatible fabrication recipe. Their modulated device suppresses gain ripples for smooth, bias-free amplification, and approaches the quantum limit of added noise. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 044081] Published Mon Oct 27, 2025"
