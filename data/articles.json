      "summary": "We provide direct experimental evidence for a state-selection principle in a far-from-equilibrium system. Using the laser-driven growth of silicon nanowires as a uniquely clean and quantifiable platform, we show that a long-range ordered array emerges as the system spontaneously selects the periodicity that maximizes its collective light absorption. This establishes a direct, measurable link between a maximum dissipation/absorption principle and emergent structural order. Our results thus offer a concrete test for models of non-equilibrium self-organization."

      "summary": "The enhancement and attenuation of near-field radiative heat transfer between polaritonic SiC, SiN and SiO2 subwavelength membranes is analyzed. Fluctuational electrodynamics simulations combined with a modal analysis show that all membranes support corner and edge modes, which can induce a large 5.1-fold enhancement for SiC and a 2.1-fold attenuation for SiO2 of the heat transfer coefficient with respect to that between infinite surfaces. The enhancement or attenuation is directly related to material losses which reduce the density of available electromagnetic states between the membranes."

      "summary": "Pi-conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a versatile platform for the realization of designer quantum nanomaterials. Strong electron-electron correlation within these artificial lattices can give rise to exotic phases of matter. Their experimental realization however requires precise control over orbital symmetry, charge localization, and band dispersion all arising from the effective hybridization between molecular linkers and nodes. Here, we present a modular strategy for constructing diatomic Kagome lattices from aza-[3]triangulene (A[3]T) nodes, in which a D3h symmetric ground state is stabilized through resonance contributions from a cumulenenic linker. First-principles density-functional theory and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveal that the hybridization of a sixfold degenerate set of edge-localized Wannier functions in the unit cell gives rise to orbital-phase frustration-induced non-trivial flat bands. These results establish a general design principle for engineering orbital interactions in organic lattices and open a pathway toward programmable COF-based quantum materials with correlated electronic ground states."

      "summary": "The controlled integration of quantum dots (QDs) as single-photon emitters into quantum light sources is essential for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. In this study, we employ the deterministic in-situ electron-beam lithography (iEBL) nanotechnology platform to integrate individual QDs with high accuracy and process yield into circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators. Notably, CBG devices comprising just 3 to 4 rings exhibit photon extraction efficiencies comparable to those of structures with more rings. This facilitates faster fabrication, reduces the device footprint, and enables compatibility with electrical contacting. To demonstrate the scalability of this process, we present results of 95 optically active QD-CBG devices fabricated across two lithography sessions. These devices exhibit bright, narrow-linewidth single-photon emission with excellent optical quality. To evaluate QD placement accuracy, we apply a powerful characterization technique that combines cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping and scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis of these devices reveals that our iEBL approach enables high alignment accuracy and a process yield of over >90% across various CBG geometries. Our findings highlight a reliable route toward the scalable fabrication of high-performance QD-based single-photon sources for use in photonic quantum technology applications."

We demonstrate the structural stability of CrSBr@CNT, where confinement and charge transfer cooperate to stabilize ferromagnetism in the 1D limit, which persists up to 50 K.

      "summary": "Density functional theory has demonstrated remarkable predictive power in calculating magnetic properties at zero temperature. At finite temperatures, thermally excited phonons may affect magnetism. Efficient ab-initio methods to calculate the temperature dependence of magnetic exchange interactions are still lacking despite the importance of room temperature magnetism for applications. Exchange is controlled by an interplay between metal-ligand hybridization, Hubbard repulsion, band gap, interatomic distances and bond angles, all of which change with temperature. Here we present a method to calculate the exchange interactions at finite temperatures from first principles using only two supercell calculations and quantify these mechanisms. Changes in bond angles and the band gap are identified as a primary factors. In NiO with 180-degree bonds exchange decreases with temperature, while in Cr$_2$O$_3$ with the bond angles away from 180 degrees the exchange increases by 10% at room temperature."

The system is composed of spin-up quasiparticles and spin-down quasiholes. The average chemical potential and energy gap have also been numerically calculated via applying different fixed interaction strengths and masses, and then by solving coupled differential equations characterized by Hartree-Fock potential for the spin species, as well as that of the phase separation (PS), leading to imbalance chemical potential. The dependence of the imbalance and average chemical potential in PS regime, to the polarization of the normal component, mass ratios, and interaction strengths are analyzed. Examining density of states (DOS), and by applying the Fermi golden rule at finite temperatures, the absorbed power has accordingly been calculated as a function of temperature, interaction strength, and mass ratio. Finally, the behavior of absorbed power versus frequency has been investigated."

These points are important for applications such as sensing, where enhanced sensitivity is required, and exhibit interesting and useful phenomena that can be controlled with experimentally accessible parameters. In this regard a four-port, three-mode, cavity-magnonics platform is demonstrated in which two microwave excitations can be precisely phase shifted and/or attenuated relative to one another. Destructive interference between the hybridised cavity-magnon modes is shown to give rise to antimodes (antiresonances) in the transmission spectrum, enabling coherent perfect extinction of the outgoing signals at selected ports. This interference can be used to actively tune the position and properties of exceptional points, without the fine tuning conventionally required to obtain exceptional points. Such controllable, interference-based engineering of exceptional points provides a practical and flexible pathway toward next-generation, high-sensitivity sensing devices operating at microwave frequencies."

      "summary": "Small polarons remain a significant bottleneck in the realization of efficient devices using transition metal oxides. Routes to engineer small polaron coupling to electronic states and lattice modes to control carrier localization remain unclear. Here, we measure the formation of small polarons in CuFeO$_{2}$ using transient extreme ultraviolet reflection spectroscopy and compare it to theoretical predictions in realistically parameterized Holstein models, demonstrating that polaron localization depends on its coupling to the high-frequency versus low-frequency components of the phonon bath. We measure that small polaron formation occurs on a comparable ~100 fs timescale to other Fe(III) compounds. After formation, a dynamic delocalization of the small polaron occurs through a coherent lattice expansion between Fe-O layers and charge-sharing with surrounding Fe(IV) states. Our simulations of polaron formation dynamics reveal that two major factors dictate polaron formation timescales: phonon density and reorganization energy distributions between acoustic and optical modes, matching experimental findings. Our work provides a detailed, real-time observation of how electronic-structural coupling in a polaron-host material can be leveraged to suppress polaronic effects for various applications."

      "summary": "A binary system of particles that move in opposite directions under an applied field can exhibit disordered states as well as laned states where the particles organize into oppositely moving high-mobility lanes to reduce collisions. Previous studies of laning transitions generally focused on particles with purely repulsive interactions. Here, we examine laning transitions for oppositely moving pattern-forming systems of particles with competing attractive and repulsive interactions, which in equilibrium form crystal, stripe, and bubble states. In addition to multiple types of laned states, we find jammed crystals, stripes, and bubbles, and generally observe a much richer variety of phases compared to the purely repulsive system. In the stripe forming regime, the system can dynamically reorder into oppositely moving stripes that are aligned in the direction of the drive. The bubble phase can produce strongly polarized jammed states of elongated bubbles where particles in the individual bubbles segregate to opposite sides of the bubbles. We also find disordered states, segregated laned bubble states where the bubbles pass each other in lanes, and segregated bubbles that move through one another. In the compact bubble regime, we obtain a plastic bubble state in which the oppositely driven particles remain trapped in the bubbles but the bubbles move past each other at a slow velocity due to a net imbalance in the bubble population. At higher drives, individual particles begin to jump from bubble to bubble. We show that the different phases and the transitions between them produce signatures in the velocity-force and differential mobility curves. We demonstrate that the critical force for escaping from the jammed state is nonmonotonic, with stripes exhibiting the lowest unjamming force."

Coherent photon driving couples selectively to electronic sublattices, and the resulting altermagnets' symmetry-broken spin texture yields a pronounced steady-state spin imbalance -- coherent magnetization -- absent in conventional antiferromagnets for the same lattice configuration. A mean-field Lindblad analysis reveals the dominance of quadratic over linear couplings. In the strong-coupling regime, distinct polariton signatures emerge in the steady state of induced magnetization. This work demonstrates cavity control of altermagnets for spintronic applications."

      "summary": "We study fermionic and bosonic systems coupled to a real or synthetic static gauge field that is quantized, so the field itself is a quantum degree of freedom and can exist in coherent superposition. A natural example is electrons on a quantum ring encircling a quantized magnetic flux (QMF) generated by a superconducting current. We show that coupling to a common QMF gives rise to an emergent interaction between particles with no classical analog, as it is topological and nonlocal (independent of interparticle distance). Moreover, the interaction persists even when the particles lie in a nominally field-free region, with the vector potential mediating the interaction. We analyze several one- and two-dimensional model systems, encompassing both real and synthetic gauge fields. These systems exhibit unusual behavior, including strong nonlinearities, non-integer Chern numbers, and quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, synthetic gauge fields offer high tunability and can reach field strengths that are difficult to realize with real magnetic fields, enabling engineered nonlinearities and interaction profiles."

However, there remain puzzling cases where SCAN and r2SCAN underperform, such as in calculating the band structure of graphene, the magnetic moment of Fe, the potential energy curve of the Cr2 molecule, and the bond length of VO2. This research identifies a common characteristic among these challenging materials: non-compact covalent bonding through s-s, p-p, or d-d electron hybridization. While SCAN and r2SCAN excel at capturing electron localization at local atomic sites, they struggle to accurately describe electron localization in non-compact covalent bonds, resulting in a biased improvement. To address this issue, we propose the r2SCAN+V approach as a practical modification that improves accuracy across all the tested materials. The parameter V is 4 eV for metallic Fe, but substantially lower for the other cases. Our findings provide valuable insights for the future development of advanced functionals."

In this study, we demonstrate that 2D bilayer ScI2, which exhibits ferromagnetic(FM) ordering within each layer, enables the tuning of interlayer magnetic coupling, ferroelectricity, and valley polarization through interlayer sliding and rotation. Our first-principles calculations show that the AA stacking configuration induces antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer coupling, while a 180 rotation of one layer (resulting in the antialigned AA stacking) leads to FM interlayer coupling. Moreover, the interlayer magnetic coupling can be switched between AFM and FM by translating the stacking configuration: FM in the aligned AB and BA configurations, and AFM in the antialigned AB and BA configurations. This switching behavior is driven by variations in superexchange interactions due to orbital hopping between layers. Notably, the aligned stacking exhibits ferroelectricity upon sliding, which is induced by interlayer orbital hybridization and the resulting asymmetric charge redistribution, with maximal ferroelectric behavior occurring at the AB and BA stacking configurations. Additionally, for the AB and BA stackings, spontaneous valley polarization emerges from the manipulation of the spin orientation toward the out-of-plane direction. This valley polarization arises due to inversion symmetry breaking, either through ferroelectricity (in the AB and BA stackings) or AFM interlayer coupling , in combination with spin-orbit coupling. These results highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism, ferroelectricity, and valley polarization in bilayer ScI2, with each property being tunable via stacking configuration."

In the realm of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and stochastic processes the standard observable computed to discriminate whether a system is at equilibrium or not is the entropy produced along the dynamics. For this reason we present here a detailed calculation of the entropy production in the Amari model, a coarse-grained model of the brain neural network, consisting in an integro-differential equation for the neural activity field, when stochasticity is added to the original dynamics. Since the way to add stochasticity is always to some extent arbitrary, i.e., in particular for coarse-grained models, there is no general prescription to do it, we precisely investigate the interplay between the noise properties and the original model features, discussing in which cases the stationary state is of thermal equilibrium and which cases is out of equilibrium, providing explicit and simple formulas. We also show how, following for the derivation the particular case considered, how the entropy production rate is related to the variation in time of the Shannon entropy of the system."

While energetic decomposition aspects can be modelled reliably, the inherent variability of chemical environment-dependent diffusion activation energies remains systematically unexplored. Here, we predict an activation energy range (envelope) for mass transport in varying chemical environments, reflecting the vacancy concentration range fcc-(Ti0.5Al0.5)1-xNx with x = 0.47, 0.5, 0.53. The stoichiometric compound shows maximum thermal stability, consistent with experimental data. Metal vacancies decrease the average migration energy, while metal and nitrogen vacancies reduce barriers via lattice strain relaxation, enhancing mobility. The strong chemical environment dependence challenges conclusions from single-point activation energy data."

SnO2 thin films, deposited at temperatures as low as 60 C and exhibiting mixed amorphous-crystalline phases with open, tortuous porosity, were evaluated for CO sensing at 200 C. Comprehensive characterization using EIS, MS, XPS, TEM, and sensor tests revealed a strong correlation between high sensing performance and the structural/electronic features of the defect rich low-temperature-deposited SnO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to identify the optimal sensing temperature. Mass spectroscopy (MS) used to analyze the exhaust gases after sensing reactions. The films exhibited oxygen under-stoichiometry and high concentrations of chemisorbed oxygen species. In situ XPS under 1 mbar (10000 ppm) O2 and CO exposures showed that chemisorbed oxygen, not lattice oxygen, was actively involved in CO oxidation, as further confirmed by CO2 detection via Mass spectroscopy (MS). Quantitative analysis revealed dynamic surface chemical status alternations, emphasizing the pivotal role of chemisorbed oxygen in the sensing mechanism at 200 C."

      "summary": "We examine how an anomalous Josephson current influences odd-frequency superconducting correlations in two distinct Josephson junction geometries. The first configuration consists of two ferromagnetic layers sandwiched between conventional s-wave superconductors, with the magnetization vectors of the ferromagnets misaligned. The second involves three ferromagnetic layers embedded between two s-wave superconductors, with their magnetizations oriented along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. In the first case, where the anomalous Josephson current is absent, odd-frequency spin-triplet correlations develop pronounced peaks at finite magnetization strengths in both the tunneling and transparent limits, while the equal-spin triplet component exhibits zeros at finite magnetizations in the transparent regime. In the second configuration, where an anomalous Josephson current is present, similar peaks in odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing appear at finite magnetizations under both transport regimes, and the spatial profile of these correlations remains largely unaffected by the current\\rq{}s presence. The Josephson diode efficiency is finite and attains its maximum at magnetization values corresponding to the peaks of the anomalous current. Overall, our results demonstrate that the anomalous Josephson current has only a marginal effect on odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, suggesting that the emergence of odd-frequency correlations and the Josephson diode effect are largely independent phenomena, contrary to some earlier conjectures."

While the application of high harmonic generation (HHG) light sources in TrARPES has increased significantly over the past decade, the optimization of the HHG probe beam size and selective control of the light polarization, which are important for TrARPES measurements, have been rarely explored. In this work, we report the implementation of high-quality HHG probe source with an optimum beam size down to 57 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 90 $\\mu$m and selective light polarization control, together with mid-infrared (MIR) pumping source for TrARPES measurements using a 10 kHz amplifier laser. The selective polarization control of the HHG probe source allows to enhance bands with different orbital contributions or symmetries, as demonstrated by experimental data measured on a few representative transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDCs) as well as topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Furthermore, by combining the HHG probe source with MIR pumping at 2 $\\mu$m wavelength, TrARPES on a bilayer graphene shows a time resolution of 140 fs, allowing to distinguish two different relaxation processes in graphene. Such high-quality HHG probe source together with the MIR pumping expands the capability of TrARPES in revealing the ultrafast dynamics and light-induced emerging phenomena in quantum materials."

Unlike the standard Floquet operator, which describes evolution over a full time period, the space-time Floquet operator evolves the system over a fraction of the period, thereby resolving finer details of its dynamics. Its eigenmode spectrum defines a space-time band structure that unfolds conventional Floquet bands to respect the intertwined crystal symmetry in reciprocal wavevector-frequency space. We relate the topology of these space-time bands to quantized transport phenomena, such as Bloch oscillations and adiabatic charge transport, and uncover a fractional version of the latter. We also demonstrate how nonreciprocal parametric resonances are naturally anticipated by our framework. The approach applies broadly to both classical and quantum systems with space-time symmetry, including non-Hermitian crystals."

Both material classes undergo reversible switching between a low-resistance opaque crystalline phase and a high-resistance but less absorbing amorphous phase through heating, electrical, or optical pulses, achieving (sub-)nanosecond switching speeds. While group 1 compounds are employed in current generation devices and relatively well studied, model systems in group 2 compounds have been found to crystallize more rapidly and thus offer the perspective of improved devices. Despite their superior crystallization speed (SET process), to this point there have been no ultrafast experimental studies on crystallized PCMs of group 2 for the RESET process. Here we perform ultrafast electron diffraction and femtosecond resolved sum frequency non-linear spectroscopy on Peierls distorted Sb$_{2}$Te crystallized thin films (PCM of group 2) following femtosecond optical pulse irradiation. We observe a pump-induced structural change on two distinct timescales: responses with characteristic timescales of $\\approx$ 300 fs and 2~ps. We quantified the experimental result by a coherent displacement and the Debye-Waller effect. In particular, the $\\approx$ 300 fs UED signal results from the ultrafast release of the Peierls distortion through non-thermal coherent Sb displacement, while the 2~ps response reflects electron-lattice equilibrium. These results reveal the ultrafast non-thermal structural dynamics of Sb$_{2}$Te and suggest energy-efficient switching of group 2 PCMs should be possible on femtosecond time scales."

Significant locomotion is found when the swimmer's flapping frequency matches the inverse relaxation time of the material. Remarkably, the swimmer moves in the opposite direction compared to its motion in a cohesion-free granular material of hard plastic spheres. At higher or lower frequencies, we observe no motion of the swimmer, apart from a short initial transient phase. X-ray radiograms reveal that the wing motions create low-density zones, which in turn give rise to a hysteresis in drag and propulsion forces. This time-dependent effect, combined with the swimmer's inertia, accounts for locomotion at intermediate frequencies."

The UEIPNet is trained using density functional theory calculations followed by Wannier projection to predict energies and forces as node-level targets and Wannier-projected TB matrices as edge-level targets. This enables physically consistent modeling of coupled mechanical electronic responses with near-DFT accuracy. Trained on bilayer graphene and monolayer MoS2 DFT data, UEIPNet captures key deformation-electronic effects: in twisted bilayer graphene, it reveals how interlayer spacing, in-plane strain, and out-of-plane corrugation drive isolated flat-band formation, and further shows that modulating substrate interaction strength can generate flat bands even away from the magic angle. For monolayer MoS2, the UEIPNet accurately reproduces phonon dispersions, strain-dependent band-gap evolution, and local density of states modulations under non-uniform strain. The UEIPNet offers a generalized, efficient, and scalable framework for studying deformation-electronic coupling in large-scale atomistic systems, bridging classical atomistic simulations and electronic-structure calculations."

      "summary": "Generation of photocurrent via photon drag effect enables very fast light detection with response time limited by momentum relaxation. At the same time, photon drag in bulk uniform samples is small by the virtue of small photon momentum. We show that the edge of metal gate placed above a two-dimensional electron system (2DES) provides highly non-uniform electromagnetic field that enhances the drag effect. We study the drag photovoltage using an exact solution of diffraction problem for 2DES with semi-infinite metal gate. We show that the only non-trivial dimensionless parameters governing the drag responsivity are the 2DES conductivity scaled by the free-space impedance {\\eta} and gate-2DES separation scaled by the incident wavelength d/{\\lambda}0. For radiation with electric field polarized orthogonal to the gate edge, the responsivity is maximized for inductive 2d conductivity with Im{\\eta} ~ 1 and Re{\\eta} << 1, and becomes very small for the capacitive 2d conductivity. The electromagnetic ponderomotive force pushes the charge carriers under the gate at arbitrary 2d conductivity, and the force direction is opposite to that at metal-2DES lateral contact. These patterns are explained by the dominant role of gated 2d plasmons in the formation of PDE photovoltage."

Many substrates support multiple wetting states depending on surface conditions or droplet history, a behavior known as metastability. This feature is crucial both for its theoretical complexity and for its relevance in practical applications that rely on controlling metastable states. While several experimental and computational techniques have been developed to study metastability, they tend to be complex or computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach based on concepts from active matter physics. We investigate the wetting behavior of a droplet placed on a pillared surface using a 3-state Cellular Potts model with a polarity term that mimics a self-propelled droplet. Applying this model to a pillared substrate with known metastable wetting states, we demonstrate that increasing activity enables the droplet to traverse free energy barriers, explore consecutive metastable states, and eventually suppress metastability entirely. Our results show that activity reduces the disparity between dry and wet states and provides a reliable framework for identifying and quantifying metastability through contact angle measurements."

Board-like conjugated polymers are particularly interesting because they exhibit novel sanidic liquid crystalline mesophases that remain largely unexplored. Specifically, although preferential molecular orientation near the free surface has been observed in films of conjugated polymers, the mechanism of its formation remains unclear. Here, we use grazing-incidence X-ray scattering to monitor the formation and breaking of positional order in situ in thin films of two conjugated polymers representative of two classes: polythiophenes and polydiketopyrrolopyrroles. Our results reveal that the surface induces positional order in films of both conjugated polymers through the formation of a highly oriented, sanidic disordered mesophase at the surface. This ordering process continues upon cooling and undergoes multiple liquid crystalline transitions into more ordered phases, both at the surface and in the bulk, which can compete with each other. The positional smectic-like order parameter exhibits continuous temperature dependence near the transition, signifying a continuous breaking of translational symmetry by the surface. Theoretical analysis enables us to accurately describe the order parameter when critical behavior is considered."

A few MSC structures have been fully resolved, revealing either bulk-like zincblende-type structures or a range of non-bulk-like motifs. Here we use a computational model to investigate the relationship between cluster size and atomic structure in zincblende-forming II-VI and III-V semiconductors. Firstly, we find that all non-bulk-like MSCs in these systems exhibit the same distorted icosahedral motif that is intrinsically chiral. Secondly, we reproduce these MSC geometries in small-cluster self-assembly simulations and discover that their chirality emerges from the geometric frustration and symmetry breaking in arranging tetrahedral bonding environments into an icosahedral topology. Overall, this work reproduces experimentally reported motifs without system-specific parameterization, establishes the structural origin of chirality in MSCs, and provides design principles for predicting new cluster geometries."

They are of interest for applications ranging from thermal barrier coatings to catalysts and magnetic materials. At least four REOPs phases were experimentally identified with RE/P ratios from 7:3 to 6:1, however the structures were solved only for 3:1 phases (RE3O3(PO4)). In this work we report the structure for the 7:3 phases (RE7O6(PO4)3) derived by ab initio analysis of models based on previously reported oxide-vanadate analogues. The most stable structures for all 7:3 REOPs were found to be isotypic, adopting monoclinic symmetry with space group P21/c. The structures were validated by comparison of their powder X-ray diffraction patterns to those of synthesized La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd and Tb 7:3 phases (Rietveld refinement for all except Tb). Ab initio analysis of thermodynamic stability showed that all 7:3 REOPs are unstable at 0 K toward decomposition to REPO4 and RE3PO7 or RE2O3. The entropy contribution stabilizes RE7O6(PO4)3 phases for light rare earth elements above 1000 K, however, starting with Dy, computationally predicted stabilization temperature is higher than estimated melting points of RE7O6(PO4)3, which is consistent with observed synthesis pattern."

One focus is the study of fully sp$^2$ non-graphitic networks, with successfully synthesized examples. Hybrid sp-sp$^2$ systems of the graphyne family are a related approach, and many systems have the honeycomb lattice as a base model.

The present work introduces a unified formalism that connects divergences, generalized free energies, generalized Fokker-Planck equations, and H-theorem. This framework is applied here in a range of scenarios, illustrating both established and novel results. In many cases, the approach begins with a free energy functional that explicitly includes a potential energy term, leading to a direct relation between this energy and the stationary solution. Conversely, when a divergence is used as free energy, the associated Fokker-Planck-like equation lacks any explicit dependence on the potential energy, depending instead on the stationary solution. To restore a potential-based interpretation, an additional relation between the stationary solution and the potential energy must be imposed. This duality underlines the flexibility of the formalism and its capacity to adapt to systems where the potential energy is unknown or unnecessary."

In this paper, we extend that method to three-dimensional liquids. We describe an efficient approach for performing the spatial integrals that appear in the renormalization group equations, which is essential for realizing numerical calculations in three dimensions. As a demonstration of our method, we present its application to the Lennard-Jones liquid. By calculating thermodynamic quantities and the pair distribution function near the critical point, we find that, compared with integral equation methods, the FRG approach preserves thermodynamic consistency much more effectively and more accurately reproduces the results of molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we successfully capture characteristic phase-transition phenomena with FRG, such as the softening of pressure near the critical temperature. Our results suggest that FRG can provide a more accurate framework for describing classical liquids than conventional methods such as integral equation theories."

      "summary": "Multiferroics, which combine ferroelectric and magnetic order, offer a transformative platform for next-generation electronic devices. However, the intrinsic competition between the mechanisms driving ferroelectricity and magnetism in single-phase materials severely limits their performance, typically resulting in weak magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature. Here, we propose a solution to this long-standing challenge through the novel concept of fractional quantum multiferroics (FQMF), where strong magnetoelectric coupling is naturally realized by coupling fractional quantum ferroelectricity (FQFE) with altermagnetism (AM). Symmetry analysis shows that reversing the FQFE polarization necessarily inverts the AM spin splitting under parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) or time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}\\tau$) operations. A minimal tight-binding model reproduces this effect, demonstrating electrically driven spin control without rotating the N\\'eel vector. First-principles calculations further identify a broad family of candidate materials in two and three dimensions including bulk MnTe, Cr$_2$S$_3$, Mn$_4$Bi$_3$NO$_{15}$ and two-dimensional AB$_2$ bilayers such as MnX$_2$ (X=Cl, Br, I), CoCl$_2$, CoBr$_2$, and FeI$_2$. Notably, MnTe exhibits a high N\\'eel temperature ($\\sim$300 K) and a large electrically switchable spin splitting ($\\sim$0.8 eV), demonstrating room-temperature magnetoelectric performance that surpasses that of conventional multiferroics. To further showcase the technological potential, we propose an electric-field-controlled FQMF tunnel junction based on MnTe that achieves tunneling magnetoresistance exceeding 300\\%. This work establishes FQMF as a distinct and promising route to achieving room-temperature strong magnetoelectric coupling, opening a new avenue for voltage-controlled spintronics."

While spin dynamics are known to significantly influence the axion state, a profound understanding of their interplay remains elusive. In this work, we employ an antiferromagnetic spin-chain model to demonstrate that an external magnetic field induces extrinsic perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We find that an in-plane field stabilizes the antiferromagnetic order, whereas an out-of-plane field destabilizes it and triggers spin-flop transitions. Remarkably, near the surface spin-flop transition in even-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, the axion insulator state undergoes a sharp switching behavior accompanied by distinct magnetoelectric responses. Furthermore, we propose that this switchable axionic magnetoelectric effect can be utilized to convert alternating magnetic field signals into measurable square-wave magneto-optical outputs, thereby realizing an axionic analog of a zero-crossing detector. Our findings could open a pathway toward potential applications of axion insulators in next-generation spintronic devices."

Using gas-liquid co-existence as a paradigm, we employ an enhanced sampling technique and design a differentiable loss function to evaluate force fields' depiction of phase diagrams. The refined force fields produce gas-liquid phase diagrams matching well with targets for two modeling systems, which confirms our approach as an effective automated force field development framework for phase transition studies."

In some cases, TRSB arises naturally from chiral superconductivity, but in many low-symmetry systems this explanation is not viable. In these latter cases, TRSB is often attributed to phase frustration among multiple superconducting gaps on different Fermi surfaces. Yet, the microscopic conditions enabling such frustration remain poorly understood. Here, inspired by the TRSB reported in the superconducting state of iron-based materials, we demonstrate that a minimal two-orbital model can support a TRSB superconducting state via phase frustration. We identify the key microscopic parameters that stabilize TRSB in d-electron systems with orthorhombic symmetry and provide a framework to systematically enlarge the region of parameter space within which TRSB is expected in materials with other electronic content and crystalline symmetries. Our results offer a simple and experimentally relevant route to understand and control TRSB in multiorbital superconductors."

We find characteristic behavior in the transient spectral function, whose features strongly depend on the pump light frequency $\\omega_p$. When $\\omega_p$ is resonant with the collective phase mode of frequency $\\Omega_c\\simeq \\Delta_{\\rm CO}/2$, where $\\Delta_{\\rm CO}$ is the charge gap, the transient spectral function exhibits a photoinduced in-gap weight which triggers large responses. With increasing the laser intensity, the development of in-gap weight directly turns into the collapse of the gap. This charge-order destabilization process is in sharp contrast to the case of $\\omega_p>\\Delta_{\\rm CO}$, where the photoirradiation induces interband electron-hole excitations giving rise to a shrinkage of the gap. The impact of quantum fluctuations and spatial inhomogeneity on the photoinduced dynamics is also discussed."

Circumventing the available approaches, in the present work, we put forward a new mechanism for symmetry breaking by introducing a bias drop along the functional element. To demonstrate this, we consider a magnetic chain with antiparallel alignment of neighboring magnetic moments. The junction is modeled within a tight-binding framework, and spin-dependent transmission probabilities are evaluated using wave-guide theory. The corresponding current components are obtained through the Landauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker formalism. Selective spin currents, exhibiting a high degree of spin polarization, are obtained over a wide bias region. Moreover, the bias-dependent transmission profile exhibits negative differential resistance (NDR), another important aspect of our study. We examine the results under three different potential profiles, one linear and two non-linear, and in each case, we observe a favorable response. This work may offer a new route for designing efficient spintronic devices based on bias-controlled magnetic systems with vanishing net magnetization."

Here we introduce DeepQT, a deep-learning framework that integrates graph neural networks with transformer architectures to enable multi-property predictions of electronic structure and transport without manual feature engineering. By learning key intermediate quantities of NEGF-DFT, the equilibrium Hamiltonian and the non-equilibrium total potential difference, DeepQT reconstructs Hamiltonians under both equilibrium and bias conditions, yielding accurate transport predictions. Leveraging the principle of electronic nearsightedness, DeepQT generalizes from small training systems to much larger ones with high fidelity. Benchmarks on graphene, MoS2, and silicon diodes with varied defects and dopants show that DeepQT achieves first-principles accuracy while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude.

Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\\mathbf{q}=(\\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly. The emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations.

We show that the disorder reduces the stability of quantum skyrmions, ultimately causing them to collapse at high disorder strengths. In addition, our results reveal two key insights. First, the presence of disorder, rather than simply degrading skyrmion order, significantly enhances local quantum entanglement, as evidenced by the rise in second R\\'enyi entropy. Second, our calculations show that the topological entanglement entropy calculated using the second R\\'enyi entropy remains negligible across all the disorder strengths. This suggests long-range entanglement is absent and the skyrmion phase is not detectable using this specific probe. Overall, our work provides new insights into how disorder constructively influences quantum materials."

      "summary": "Rare earth doping is an effective way to convert chemically stable oxides into multifunctional materials with coupled electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. We present first principles calculations of pristine and Tm3+ doped Ca2SnO4 to understand how localized 4f states change the structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical behavior of the host. Pristine Ca2SnO4 is a mechanically stable, wide band gap insulator with mostly ionic covalent bonding and diamagnetic character. Replacing Ca2+ with Tm3+ introduces several key changes: (i) localized Tm 4f states create intermediate levels inside the wide gap, reducing the optical band gap; (ii) exchange and spin orbit interactions generate strong local magnetic moments and spin asymmetry near the conduction band; (iii) electron localization function analysis shows enhanced covalency and electron pockets that stabilize luminescent centers; and (iv) the optical response shows visible range absorption, refractive index features, and low energy plasmon peaks while maintaining high energy dielectric stability. These effects make Tm doped Ca2SnO4 a mechanically robust, optically tunable, and magnetically active oxide phosphor suitable for red emission, intermediate band photovoltaics, and spin photon coupling. More broadly, our results show how targeted rare earth substitution can enable multifunctionality in wide gap stannates and guide the design of next generation spintronic photonic oxides."

      "summary": "A regular lattice of magnetic skyrmions is the ground state of thin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in a relatively wide range of external magnetic fields. It was previously theoretically shown that upon the increase of magnetic field a topological transition in the magnon spectrum of such skyrmion crystal (SkX) may occur. Non-uniform magnetic field may lead to localized magnon states emerging at the interface between two half-planes of SkX. Using semiclassical quantization and the stereographic projection approach, we study such appearing edge states both in a full band structure calculation and in simplified effective model. The latter effective model described by extended Dirac equation is applicable to two relevant magnon bands near $\\Gamma$ point. We show that both the chirality of emerging edge states and the degree of its localization at the interface is controlled by magnetic field profile. We demonstrate that the localization length may be as small as a few inter-skyrmion distances."

      "summary": "A comprehensive analysis is presented for the diffusivity of oxygen defects and oxygen self-diffusion in ThO$-2$. The migration energy and diffusivity of oxygen defects with nominal charges have been investigated using density functional theory and phonon simulations. The pathway for the lowest migration energy barrier of oxygen vacancies was found to be along the $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ direction. Neutral and non-neutral oxygen interstitials exhibited direct (interstitial) and indirect (interstitialcy) migration, respectively. The vacancy migration barrier was found to be lowest for the highest charge, while for interstitials, it is lowest when the charge is lowest. The attempt frequencies of defects were calculated using the Eyring and Vineyard theories. These frequencies displayed a similar dependence on the defect charge as the activation barriers. The charge-averaged diffusivity of vacancies and interstitials were also computed. Across all temperatures, the average vacancy diffusivity was found to be greater than that of interstitial, indicating that oxygen vacancies are more mobile than interstitials. Oxygen self- and chemical diffusion coefficients were analyzed by combining the defect diffusivities with the concentrations computed using an equilibrium defect thermodynamics. The self-diffusion coefficient of oxygen was found to rise with temperatures and lower oxygen pressures. The contributions of various defects to self-diffusion of oxygen were subsequently examined. In the normal to high oxygen pressure range, at all temperatures, it is found that interstitials contribute most to oxygen diffusion in ThO2. At low oxygen pressures, vacancies with highest charge state were found to dominate oxygen diffusion. The chemical diffusion coefficient of oxygen was further computed, which was found to increase with temperature and decrease with hypo-stoichiometry in ThO2 to a plateau value."

      "summary": "The crystal lattice governs the emergent electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of quantum materials, making structural tuning through strain, pressure, or chemical substitution a key approach for discovering and controlling novel quantum phases. Beyond static modifications, driving specific lattice modes with ultrafast stimuli offers a dynamic route for tailoring material properties out of equilibrium. However, achieving dynamic coherent control of the nonequilibrium phases via resonant excitation of lattice coherences remains largely unexplored. Such manipulation enables non-volatile, on demand amplification and suppression of order parameters on femtosecond timescales, necessary for next generation optoelectronic ultrafast computation. In this study, we demonstrate coherent phononic control of a newly discovered, light-induced metastable magnetization in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. By using a sequence of terahertz (THz) pulses, we modulate the magnetization amplitude at the frequencies of phonon coherences, whose infrared-active nature and symmetries are further revealed by polarization- and field-strength-dependent measurements. Furthermore, our two-dimensional THz spectroscopy, in tandem with first-principles numerical simulations, shows that these phonons nonlinearly displace a Raman active phonon, which induces the metastable net magnetization. These findings not only clarify the microscopic mechanism underlying the metastable state in FePS3 but also establish vibrational coherences in solids as a powerful tool for ultrafast quantum phase control, enabling manipulation of material functionalities far from equilibrium."

Starting from the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the quantum AHE (QAHE) with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) to their spinful generalizations, including spin Hall effect (SHE) and quantum SHE (QSHE) protected by TRS, they reveal rich transport and topological phenomena. However, in larger-spin $S$ ($S>1/2$) systems, besides charge current and spin current, there arise higher-rank spin-tensor currents. Recent work has uncovered an interesting spin-tensor Hall effect with spin-tensor currents in these larger-spin systems. Taking a step further, this work discovers a new class of topological states of matter dubbed \\textit{quantum spin-tensor Hall} (QSTH) insulators with broken TRS, and their nontrivial topology is protected by a unique \\textit{pseudo-TRS}. Most strikingly, QSTH insulators exhibit a quantized rank-2 spin-tensor Hall conductivity, whereas both charge (rank-0) and spin (rank-1) conductivities vanish. We also fully characterize their topological properties and highlight the physical interpretations via the underlying connections to QSHE. Our work enriches the family of the famous Hall effects and sheds light on the intriguing topological state of matter in larger-spin systems. It further offers new avenues toward spin-tensor-tronics and low-power atomtronics."

We show that the collective response of a multi-agent train amplifies sensitivity to weak gradients beyond what is achievable by a single agent. We discover a fractional transport phenomenon in which, under a uniform gradient, collective motion freezes abruptly whenever the ratio of intra-agent sensor separation to inter-agent spacing satisfies a number-theoretic commensurability condition. This commensurability locking persists even as the number of agents tends to infinity. We find that this condition is exactly solvable on the rationals -- a dense subset of real numbers -- providing analytic, testable predictions for when transport stalls. Our findings establish a surprising bridge between number theory and emergent transport in swarm robotics, informing design principles with implications for collective migration, analog computation, and even the exploration of number-theoretic structure via physical experimentation."

Furthermore, parallel computation enables efficient generation of large-scale structures, while memory usage is reduced compared to PoreSpy. To evaluate performance, structures were generated using both PoreSpy and the proposed method with parameters corresponding to X-ray ptychography experiments. The porosity mismatch in PoreSpy led to a relative error exceeding 20% in the computed gas diffusion coefficients, whereas our method reproduced the experimental values within 5%. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an efficient, high-precision approach for generating porous structures and supports reliable prediction of material properties.

These two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for applications in advanced gas sensing and catalysis. Our analysis reveals that Ni-doped graphene, validated through work function calculations, is a promising material for gas separation and hydrogen production. The samples with adsorbed molecules are characterized by calculating chemical potential, chemical hardness, electronegativity, electrophilicity, vibrational frequencies, adsorbtion and Gibbs energies by DFT calculations. Methane molecules preferentially adsorb at the hexagonal ring centers of graphene, while ammonia inter-acts more strongly with carbon atoms, highlighting distinct molecular doping mechanisms for CH4 and NH3. Dynamic simulations show that CH4 splits into CH3+H, with Ni-doped graphene facilitating enhanced hydrogen transmission, while NH3 dissociates into NH2+H, which may lead to N2H4 formation. Our non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) simulations demonstrate increased H-atom transmission on Ni-doped graphene during gas interactions. These findings suggest that Ni-doped graphene is superior to pristine graphene for applications in gas separation, hydrogen production, and high-sensitivity sensors."

Studying these movements across scales-from microscopic to macroscopic-yields valuable insights into urban dynamics. Local adaptation and (self-)organization in such systems are expected to result in dynamical behaviors that are represented by stationary trajectories of an appropriate effective action. In this study we develop a Lagrangian dynamical model for movement processes, using local population functions as the coordinate variables. An efficient gradient descent algorithm is introduced to estimate the optimal Lagrangian parameters minimizing a local error function of the dynamical process. We show that even a quadratic Lagrangian, incorporating dissipation, effectively captures the dynamics of synthetic and empirical movement data. The inferred models reveal that inertia and dissipation are of comparable importance, while interactions and randomness in the movements induce significant qualitative changes in model parameters. Our results provide an interpretable and generative model for human mobility, with potential applications in movement prediction."

      "summary": "This work reports optical and electronic numerical modelling of a novel emerging structure which is the GaAs nanocrystal on Si tandem solar cell by epitaxial lateral overgrowth, a technique which allows defect free material growth. The techniqueconsists of creating nucleation sites in a silicon surface SiO2 layer and initiating growth of nanoscalescale seeds, whereby strain energy remains below the Matthews-Blakeslee strain relaxation limit. This leads to AlxGaAs growth in micro-crystals without generation of material defects. The focus of this presentation is optical and electrical modelling of nanocrystals for applications in the very active field of silicon based multijunction solar cells, and design of a AlxGaAs/Si two terminal tandem, for compositions ranging from x=0 to x=30% in absorber layers. We present a model of the complete structure in two dimensions, consisting of a Al xGaAs high bandgap subcell connected with a tunnel junction to the low bandgap Si junction. The elaboration of models is described, with an emphasis on the AlxGaAs crystal featuring a non-planar pn-junction, and a focus on the optical properties of this lattice of micrometric AlGaAs crystals and in particular their light trapping properties from the resulting surface texture. The question of AlxGaAs surface coverage is addressed, given that neighbouring AlxGaAs crystals have different crystal orientations on a (111) Si surface, such that any coalescence of neighbour AlxGaAs crystals leads to crippling defects at their interface. The result is that some high energy incident light above the AlxGaAs bandgap is nevertheless transmitted directly to the Si cell, such that the resulting photogenerated carriers thermalise to the Silicon bandgap, and result in a loss of efficiency. The interface between AlxGaAs and Si subcells is addressed, with an emphasis on current transport efficiency through the nanoseeds and tunnelling currents through appropriately designed SiO2 buffer layers. This work therefore presents a theoretical framework for evaluating the potential of AlxGaAs nanocrystal growth on Si for light trapping, for GaAs silicon two terminal tandem cell performance including tunnel junctions, and provides models and design rules for efficient AlxGaAs microcrystal arrays as high bandgap subcells for tandem solar cells on silicon."

      "summary": "Flatbands (FB) with compact localized eigenstates (CLS) fall into three main categories, controlled by the algebraic properties of the CLS set: orthogonal, linearly independent, linearly dependent (singular). A CLS parametrization allows us to continuously tune a linearly independent FB into a limiting orthogonal or a linearly dependent (singular) one. We derive the asymptotic real space decay of the flat band projectors for each category. The linearly independent FB is characterized by an exponentially decaying projector and a corresponding localization length $\\xi$, all dressed by an algebraic prefactor. In the orthogonal limit, the localization length is \\(\\xi=0\\), and the projector is compact. The singular FB limit corresponds to \\(\\xi \\rightarrow \\infty\\) with an emerging power law decay of the projector. We obtain analytical estimates for the localization length and the algebraic power law exponents depending on the dimension of the lattice and the number of bands involved. Numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytics. Our results are of relevance for the understanding of the details of the FB quantum metric discussed in the context of FB superconductivity, the impact of disorder, and the response to local driving."

A strategy for finding alloy compositions that minimize the transformation hysteresis is necessary.

It is based on an original route to process bulk gradient composition single crystals to investigate fine variation of composition range coupled with local measurements of the austenite-martensite microstructure by light microscopy during the transformation. The latter method is compared with differential scanning calorimetry measurements. The methodology is applied in an Al-richer range of composition of standard CuZnAl SMA where a minimum of transformation hysteresis is observed."

Considering experimental temperature and force loading rate allows the prediction of measured bond rupture forces from a closed expression with very good accuracy."

      "summary": "In a previous paper, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a microeconomic framework of investors and firms. The financial connections were modeled by a field of stakes, representing the links between agents. We showed that the resulting collective states were composed of interconnected groups of agents defined by their connections, their returns and disposable capital. However, within this framework, the collective states exhibited structural instability, as capital shortages in specific sectors could trigger cascades of defaults. The present model refines this framework by introducing a third type of agent, banks, a type of investor that can create money through loans. We show that money creation neither eliminates systemic instability nor prevents the emergence of defaults. In fact, the effect of banks on system stability and defaults is ambiguous: When banks favor firms over investors, money creation stabilizes the system by providing the necessary capital to prevent initial defaults, whereas when banks favor investors over firms, investors' influence is strengthened, potentially amplifying instability and defaults. Moreover, regardless of whether they favor investors or firms, banks may facilitate the propagation of defaults once they have started. Ultimately, because banks are themselves investors, the emergence of highly capitalized, high-return banks can directly generate instability in the system. Beyond these mechanisms, the analysis reveals the structural limits of macroprudential regulation. Highly capitalized, high-return investors and banks may appear more diversified and resilient, yet they constitute the primary source of endogenous instability. The model thus highlights that systemic fragility is inherent to the very structure of financial interdependence and capital flows."

Despite studies on individual defect types, a comprehensive understanding of the defect landscape in {\\mu}-phases, a class of topologically close-packed phases, remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the planar defect structures in the Ta-Fe {\\mu}-phase across a compositional range of 46 to 58 at.% Ta using electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Electron backscatter diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a transition from basal twin boundaries and planar faults containing C14 TaFe2 Laves phase layers at a low Ta content to pyramidal {1\\bar{1}02} twins at a higher Ta content. Density functional theory calculations of defect formation energies confirm a chemical potential-driven stabilisation of Laves phase lamellae. The prevalence of pyramidal twins in Ta-rich {\\mu}-phase samples is attributed to the competitive nature of different planar defects during solidification. A defect landscape for {\\mu}-phases is proposed, illustrating the interplay between site occupancy, dislocation types and planar faults across the chemical potential space. These findings provide fundamental insights into defect engineering in structurally complex intermetallics and open pathways for optimising material properties through chemical tuning."

      "summary": "Area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) is an emerging technology in semiconductor manufacturing. However, accurately understanding inhibitor reactivity on surfaces remains challenging, particularly when the substrate is amorphous. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate reaction pathways and quantify the reactivity of (N,N-dimethylamino)trimethylsilane (DMATMS) and ethyltrichlorosilane (ETS) at silanol (-OH), siloxane (-O-), amine (-NH2), and imide (-NH-) sites on both amorphous and crystalline silicon oxide and silicon nitride surfaces. Notably, both molecules exhibit greater reactivity toward terminal sites (-OH and -NH2) on amorphous surfaces compared to crystalline counterparts. For bridge sites, -O- and -NH-, multiple reaction pathways are identified, with bridge-cleavage reactions being the predominant mechanism, except for DMATMS reactions with nitride surfaces. The reactivity of DMATMS with -NH- sites is comparable to that with -NH2, with both reactions yielding volatile products. This study underscores the importance of amorphous surface modeling in reliably predicting inhibitor adsorption and reactivity on realistic surfaces. Moreover, we outline a computational screening approach that accounts for site-specific precursor-inhibitor interactions, enabling efficient and rational theoretical design of AS-ALD precursor-inhibitor pairs."

Assuming charge tunneling between quantum dots through the spin-flip processes, we study the molecular Andreev bound states appearing in the proximized quantum dots. We show that the spin-orbit coupling induces four quasiparticle states. For the appropriate set of model parameters, two of these internal quasiparticles merge, forming the zero-energy state. Under such circumstances, we obtain fully spin-polarized versions of the Majorana quasiparticles, localized on different quantum dots. This situation occurs solely when the spin-orbit interaction is equally strong to the magnitude of crossed Andreev reflections, i.e. in the sweet spot. Otherwise, these processes are competitive, as indicated in expectation values of the corresponding order parameters. We analyze signatures of such competition manifested under the nonequilibrium conditions, for various configurations of bias voltage. In particular, for the symmetric bias voltage between the normal electrodes and the Cooper pair splitter bias configuration we reveal duality in the transport properties. Charge transport through the zero-energy state at the sweet spot is contributed by perfectly entangled electrons with an (almost) ideal transmission. Transport studies would thus enable empirical detection of the molecular quasiparticle states and the efficiency of dissipation processes caused by the external normal electrodes."

The system was described by a five-band tight-binding Hamiltonian parameterized using first-principles data, and the transport properties were calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework. Spin resolved transmissions and spin polarization were computed for a range of lead widths and proximity-induced exchange field strengths. The analysis revealed distinct transport characteristics determined by geometry and edge configuration: armchair-connected structures exhibited broader and more stable fully spin-polarized windows compared with zigzag-connected counterparts. Furthermore, critical lead-width thresholds ($\\approx 1.01$ nm for zigzag and $\\approx 0.87$ nm for armchair) and a moderate exchange field above which complete spin filtering occurs were identified. The results highlight the strong influence of edge termination and confinement geometry on transport properties and provide useful design guidelines for developing borophene-based nanoscale spintronic devices."

However, in kagome ASI, experimental access to the ground state remains elusive due to dynamical freezing. Here, we demonstrate a deterministic and rewritable approach to attain the ground state using ultrafast, site-selective laser annealing. By engineering sublattice-dependent optical absorption through selective capping of the nanomagnets with Cr or utilizing different nanomagnet thicknesses, we achieve selective partial demagnetization of one sublattice under a sub-coercive magnetic field, driving the system into the ground state in a single switching step. Magnetic force microscopy reveals nearly perfect long-range ordering, while heat-transfer simulations confirm the sublattice-selective excitation mechanism. This work establishes an ultrafast method to attain the kagome ASI ground state, which does not require a modification of the geometry of the ASI or the materials used for the individual nanomagnets. Beyond ground-state writing, this site-selective activation provides an important tool for controlling the magnetic states, which is important for applications such as reconfigurable magnonic crystals, neuromorphic computing and programmable nanomagnetic logic."

The tipe of local surface I-V characteristics is ohmic at the concentration range of the dopant 0 =0.15 M, which is determined by a decrease in the size and a change in the shape of the film grains, as well as a decrease in the surface roughness of the film. An increase in the iodine content in the PbS(I) films leads to nonlinear dependences of the microscopic characteristics and photoelectric parameters of the PbS(I) films. A sharp decrease in the diffusion coefficient, the beginning of an increase in the charge carrier lifetime, a maximum in voltage sensitivity and specific detectability are observed in the PbS(I) film chemically deposited from a reaction mixture containing [NH4I] = 0.15 M.

We do so by introducing the idea of an active particle whose velocity acquires an active contribution that depends on its past trajectory suitably weighted by a memory kernel. The memory kernel is unrelated to the thermal noise acting on the particle, meaning that the particle breaks detailed balance at the microscopic level. The number density of these active particles is described by a Cahn-Hilliard equation, which typically describes passive phase separation, suitably modified to account for this particular non-equilibrium effect.

Through a combination of low-energy analysis and a numerical self-consistent approach, we demonstrate that HK interaction can enhance the SDE's quality factor.

Due to interpore interactions, besides the applied voltage and solution environment, the ion transport properties in porous membranes are influenced by the pore number and spacing. Here, to understand and control the transport properties of nanopore arrays, we systematically investigate the ion transport characteristics through membranes with different charge properties, pore numbers, and interpore distances. Using numerical simulations, we analyzed local ionic concentrations and electric potential in nanopore arrays containing nanopores with uniformly charged walls as well as unipolar diodes i.e., pores containing a junction between a charged zone and a neutral zone, and showed significant ion concentration polarization (ICP) for all studied cases. As the number of pores increased and the interpore spacing decreased, the enhanced interpore interactions through ICP led to a greater deviation of the total ionic current from the linear superposition of single-pore currents. Conversely, in bipolar nanopores whose walls contain a junction between positively and negatively charged zones ICP becomes negligible, and interpore interactions are substantially reduced. Furthermore, for membranes with various charge properties, the total current through nanopore arrays presents different quantitative dependence on the pore number under varying pore spacings. Our findings clarify the mechanism of interpore interactions in modulating ion transport through porous membranes, providing critical insights for designing nanofluidic devices based on nanopore arrays, such as nanopore-array sensors."

      "summary": "Altermagnets combine zero net magnetization with giant spin splitting, enabling spin-polarized transport without strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Deterministically selecting the conducting spin channel, however, requires breaking the 90 degree rotation and time-reversal antisymmetry (C4zT). Using standard axial vector transformation rules as preliminaries, we show that in monolayer Ta2TeSeO this can be achieved naturally and tuned in a symmetry efficient way by rotating the Neel vector. Without considering the Neel vector, Ta2TeSeO has one pair of mirror protected spin polarized Weyl points in each spin channel. Aligning the Neel vector along the crystallographic x or y direction breaks the mirror symmetry Mx or My, inducing selective mirror symmetry breaking that keeps one spin sector gapless and opens a gap in the opposite spin, yielding fully spin polarized transport. The C2z symmetry breaking makes the preserved two Weyl points inequivalent, turning the half semimetal into a half metallic state. The same orientation selective symmetry reduction applies to lattice vibrations, implying phonon chirality splitting. Owing to the near degenerate in plane anisotropy, reversible zero moment switching is achievable with minute in plane strain or weak magnetic fields, and the lattice coupling suggests control by circularly polarized light. The mechanism extends to other two dimensional decorated Lieb altermagnets lacking horizontal mirror Mz, providing a general low power route to spin filtering and logic."

      "summary": "Flexible slender structures such as rods, ribbons, plates, and shells exhibit extreme nonlinear responses bending, twisting, buckling, wrinkling, and self contact, that defy conventional simulation frameworks. Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) has emerged as a geometry first, structure preserving paradigm for modeling such behaviors. Unlike finite element or mass spring methods, DDG discretizes geometry rather than governing equations, allowing curvature, twist, and strain to be defined directly on meshes. This approach yields robust large deformation dynamics, accurate handling of contact, and differentiability essential for inverse design and learning based control. This review consolidates the rapidly expanding landscape of DDG models across 1D and 2D systems, including discrete elastic rods, ribbons, plates, and shells, as well as multiphysics extensions to contact, magnetic actuation, and fluid structure interaction. We synthesize applications spanning mechanics of nonlinear instabilities, biological morphogenesis, functional structures and devices, and robotics from manipulation to soft machines. Compared with established approaches, DDG offers a unique balance of geometric fidelity, computational efficiency, and algorithmic differentiability, bridging continuum rigor with real time, contact rich performance. We conclude by outlining opportunities for multiphysics coupling, hybrid physics data pipelines, and scalable GPU accelerated solvers, and by emphasizing DDG role in enabling digital twins, sim to real transfer, and intelligent design of next generation flexible systems."

      "summary": "Chirality in solids is attracting growing attention as a potential ferroic order, yet virtually no paradigmatic example of a soft-mode achiral-to-chiral phase transition has been firmly established to date. Here we identify ferroelectric bubble domains as a model system that undergoes a strain-driven achiral-to-chiral transition exhibiting the hallmarks of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Using second-principles atomistic simulations, we uncover chiral phonon modes in ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices that soften under epitaxial strain following textbook soft-mode behaviour. The transition is accompanied by a change in topological character, highlighting an interplay between chirality and topology in these systems. This work provides a concrete step towards establishing chirality as a genuine ferroic order in solids."

These regimes are associated with the emergence of highly complex electron trajectories on the Fermi surface and correspond to a nontrivial (scaling) behavior of the conductivity tensor in strong magnetic fields. The geometry of such trajectories, as well as the corresponding conductivity regimes, have been well studied theoretically; however, they have not yet been observed experimentally. The results of our study allow us, in particular, to estimate the probability of their occurrence and to indicate the conditions for their possible detection for a wide class of conductors."

In this work, we take advantage of the layer-by-layer growth regime to fabricate epitaxial CrVO$_3$ superlattice thin films with atomic-scale accuracy on the periodic arrangement of Cr and V layers. By means of X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we confirm the thickness control in the sub-unit cell scale, alternating 3, 2 or 1 single atomic layers of Cr$_2$O$_3$ and V$_2$O$_3$. For the first time, we stabilize the ilmenite phase of CrVO$_3$ (space group R-3) and compare the functional properties of the thin film with those calculated by density functional theory. This novel approach to the growth of ordered corundum oxides opens the path towards the stabilization of new complex oxides with tailored properties by varying the composition and the superlattice period, ultimately broadening the family of functional rhombohedral oxides."

We formulate a universal scheme for realizing nonvolatile ME coupling in Type-I multiferroics, where two distinct pathways emerge, each dictated by spin-space symmetry. The first pathway is associated with switching of the spin splitting or the now familiar spin-momentum locking in reciprocal space, characteristic of some altermagnetic mul-tiferroics that exhibit coexisting antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. The second pathway involves real-space magnetization switching via electric polarization reversal, characterized by switchable components of the linear ME tensor, despite the traditionally weak coupling in Type-I systems due to the independent origins of magnetism and ferroelectricity. We demonstrate that these two intrinsic ME coupling mechanisms are mutually exclusive and propose thermodynami-cally stable compounds for experimentation. Our findings establish general design principles for controlling robust nonvolatile ME effects in multiferroic materials."

      "summary": "The formation and subsequent growth of structural defects in an irradiated material can strongly influence the material's performance in technological and industrial applications. Predicting how the growth of defects affects material performance is therefore a pressing problem in materials science. One common computational approach that is used to examine defect growth is cluster dynamics, a method which employs a system of mean-field rate equations to track the time evolution of concentrations of individual defect types. However, the computational complexity of performing cluster dynamics can limit its practical implementation, specifically in the context of exploring a broad set of physical conditions corresponding to, for example, different temperatures and pressures. Here, we present a machine learning approach to circumvent the computational challenges of performing cluster dynamics while maintaining high accuracy in the prediction of defect concentrations. The method is illustrated on the nuclear material uranium nitride but is broadly applicable to other materials. The developed data-driven method is shown to accurately capture complex correlations between material properties, temperature, irradiation conditions, and the concentration of defects."

      "summary": "A fundamental issue in the renormalization-group (RG) theory of critical phenomena concerns the allowed values of critical exponents that are consistent with the continuous nature of a phase transition. Here we conjecture a lower bound for the length-scale exponent $\\nu$ that should hold at continuous transitions associated with $d$-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) $\\Phi^4$ theories with a multicomponent scalar field $\\varphi_i$ (including some extensions with fermionic and gauge fields). If $\\Delta_\\varphi=(d-2+\\eta)/2$ is the dimension of the order parameter -- $\\varphi_i$ in LGW models -- and $\\Delta_\\varepsilon=d-1/\\nu$ is the RG dimension of the energy operator $\\varepsilon$, which can be identified with $[\\sum_i \\varphi_i^2]$ (the squared field with a proper subtraction of the mixing with the identity), we conjecture the inequality $\\Delta_\\varepsilon - 2 \\Delta_\\varphi\\ge 0$, which implies $1/\\nu \\le 2-\\eta$ and $\\gamma = (2-\\eta)\\nu\\ge 1$. These inequalities are supported by general arguments for lattice models, exact relations for two-dimensional minimal conformal field theories, and are consistent with all known (numerical, perturbative, and exact) results for LGW $\\Phi^4$ theories. In particular, since unitarity requires $\\eta\\ge 0$, the above inequality implies $\\nu\\ge 1/2$ for unitary theories. This lower bound is more restrictive than the bound $\\nu > 1/d$, which is derived by noting that $\\nu=1/d$ is the expected behavior at first-order transitions."

The capsules, modeled as flexible membranes enclosing active internal regions, exhibit a rich variety of behaviors shaped by their geometry and the interplay between internal and external activity. Circular capsules with active interiors undergo persistent rotation driven by internally confined +1/2 topological defects. Axisymmetric capsules, such as boomerangs, develop directed motion along their axis of symmetry due to unbalanced active forces generated by defect distributions near their boundaries. We further show that capsule flexibility suppresses motility and rotation, as active stresses are dissipated into shape deformations. These findings reveal how shape, deformability, and defect dynamics cooperate to produce emergent motility in soft active matter, with potential applications in the design of microswimmers and drug delivery vehicles."

      "summary": "We briefly review the early development of the mean-field dynamics for cooperatively interacting quantum many-body systems, mapped to pseudo-spin (Ising-like) systems. We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each of the components following Suzuki-Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field which provided us a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes-Suzuki-Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems."

We investigate the influence of disorder on the nonlinear terahertz response and the Higgs mode in NbN thin films with varying Ioffe-Regel parameters ($k_Fl$). In strongly disordered films near the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT), we observe an anomalous third-harmonic generation (THG) signal above $T_c$, which is absent in both cleaner superconducting and non-superconducting counterparts. The persistence of this normal-state THG signal in a high magnetic field excludes superconducting fluctuations as its origin. Below $T_c$, the THG intensity increases sharply, indicating a dominant contribution from the driven Higgs mode. The THG spectrum of the strongly disordered sample exhibits a broadened, multi-peak structure, which we attribute to quantum path interference between distinct channels involving unpaired electrons and Cooper pairs within emergent superconducting islands. Our findings not only demonstrate how disorder tunes the nonlinear terahertz response but also uncover a strong coupling between electrons responsible for normal-state THG and the superconducting Higgs mode below $T_c$ in strongly disordered samples."

Furthermore, it proves a thermal transimpedance of $\\sim 20$ mK/V at a bath temperature of $30$ mK. The development of such systems holds substantial promise for advancing heat management and routing in quantum chips and radiation sensors, as it enables precise nonlocal control of heat flow towards a designated structure, even when the heat source is distant and non-galvanically coupled."

      "summary": "Tandem solar cells offer a promising alternative to exceed the efficiency limits of single-junction silicon photovoltaics, yet they require high-performance recombination junctions that are transparent, passivating, and electrically efficient. Indium tin oxide (ITO), which is conventionally used as a recombination junction material, faces challenges related to indium scarcity and sputter-induced damage. This work investigates hydrogenated aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO:H) deposited by spatial atomic layer deposition (s-ALD) as a viable indiumfree alternative for TOPCon-based bottom cells. The deposited AZO:H films demonstrate excellent transparency, exceeding 90% in the 380-1200 nm wavelength range. When applied to n-TOPCon surfaces with an AlOx capping layer, the stack achieves an outstanding passivation quality, indicated by implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) values up to 734 mV after annealing. The AlOx capping layer proved crucial for enhancing thermal stability by preventing hydrogen effusion at higher temperatures. While the contact resistivity was high for the 20 nm thick films tested, the combination of superior optical and passivation properties establishes spatial ALD-deposited AZO:H as a highly promising material for creating efficient and indiumfree recombination junctions in next-generation tandem solar cells."

      "summary": "Cell shape changes are largely controlled by the actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic filament network beneath the plasma membrane. Several cell types can form extended free-standing protrusions not supported by an extracellular substrate or matrix, and regulated by proteins that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics in a way sensitive to the curvature of the cell membrane. We develop a theoretical model for the mechanics of a free-standing viscous actin network growing on a corrugated membrane. The model couples the dynamics of the viscous active gel with membrane deformation and the recruitment of curvature-sensitive actin nucleators. We show that an actin layer polymerising uniformly on the membrane always exerts a stabilising effect that reduces membrane deformation. However, curvature-sensitive actin nucleator proteins can render the membrane linearly unstable, depending on the interplay between membrane and actin dynamics, giving rise to spontaneous membrane deformation which could initiate extended free-standing cellular protrusion."

      "summary": "Brillouin light scattering (BLS) is a key technique in studying magnonic systems, but its sensitivity is often limited. While nanoplasmonic systems can enhance BLS through near-field effects, we propose a novel approach for additional amplification. In this conceptual paper, we show how to actively supply energy to a surface collective electromagnetic resonance (SCR) supported by a sparse layer of metal nanoparticles on a magnetic film. Proposed methods are designed to significantly amplify the efficiency of surface-enhanced Brillouin light scattering without increasing the intensity of the primary excitation. In the proposed scheme, the pump extends the propagation length of the SCR, leading directly to BLS amplification. We analyze the conditions for such amplification, with numerical estimates indicating a potential gain of more than an order of magnitude in the surface-wave amplitude. This gain far surpasses the modest increase achievable through passive enhancement alone. These findings outline a practical pathway to achieving BLS amplification in integrated magnonic platforms."

Inspired by translocation observations on California blackworms (\\textit{Lumbriculus variegatus}), we combine biological experiments and active-polymer simulations to examine how confinement and stiffness govern translocation. Active filaments translocate fastest when the channel width is comparable to their diameter, with escape time determined by propulsion speed, filament length, and channel geometry. In wider channels, activity and flexibility induce reorientation-dominated conformational changes that prolong escape. A single dimensionless ratio linking confinement to stiffness captures the transition from axis-aligned escape with short wall deflections for stiffer filaments, to reorientation-controlled motion with blob-like shapes for flexible filaments. These results provide a unified physical framework for active translocation in confinement and suggest design principles for flexible robotic filaments in complex environments."

This is reminiscent of the so-called {\\guillemotleft} healing length {\\guillemotright} in the case of a thin liquid film wetting a rough solid substrate. We explore the ability of continuum mechanics models to account for these observations. Modeling the epithelium as a thin liquid film, with surface tension, does not fully account for the measurements. Neither does modeling the epithelium as a thin incompressible elastic film. On the contrary, the addition of an apical active stress gives satisfactory agreement with measurements, with one fitting parameter, the ratio between the active stress and the elastic modulus."

Generally, these physics are difficult to capture with ab initio and first principles methods. However, previous works have shown various methods to be successful in predicting at least some of the physics of the gamma to alpha phase transition. Therefore, here, we perform a broad survey of density functional based methods across three levels of theory and types of functions (GGA, MetaGGA, and Hybrid functionals) and compare the results, focusing on hydrostatic compression across the phase boundary at zero Kelvin. For the methods that best reproduce experimental results, we directly probe the predicted mechanisms and frame the results in the Mott/Kondo debate, assessing how the underlying methods and assumptions of different functionals can assess the physical drivers in the phase transition, providing insight into the governing dynamics of this unique phase transition."

      "summary": "We present a first-principles method based on density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory for computing spin excitations in magnetic systems with noncollinear spin textures. Traditionally, the study of magnetic excitations has relied on spin models that assume magnetic moments to be localized. Beyond this restriction, recent $ab~initio$ methods based on Green's functions within the local spin-density approximation have emerged as a general framework for calculating magnetic susceptibilities. However, their application has so far been largely limited to collinear ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. In this work, we extend this framework and enable the treatment of large-scale noncollinear magnetic systems by leveraging a Wannier-basis representation and implementing an ansatz potential method to reduce computational cost. We apply our method to the spin-spiral state of LiCu$_2$O$_2$, successfully capturing its steady-state spin-rotation pitch in agreement with the experimental measurement and resolving the characteristic magnon dispersion. We further analyze the interplay between the spiral spin structure and the on-site spin-exchange splitting, and elucidate the crucial role of magnetic dipoles on ligand ions in mediating effective ferromagnetic interaction among the primary spins on Cu$^{2+}$ ions. Finally, we provide a theoretical prediction of the magnon dispersion on top of the helical spin background in high agreement with the experimental measurement. Overall, this work establishes a general and computationally efficient framework for simulating collective spin dynamics in noncollinear magnetic systems from first principles, exemplified by -- but not limited to -- spin-spiral states."

The main objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends. Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS - 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1 exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998)."

Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results."

While deep learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining. Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and powerful tool."

We test the method in driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics.

      "summary": "The standard Axelrod model of cultural dissemination, based on discrete cultural traits, exhibits a non-equilibrium phase transition but is inherently limited by its inability to continuously probe the critical behavior. We address this limitation by introducing a generalized Axelrod model utilizing continuous cultural traits confined to the interval $[0,1]$, and a similarity threshold, $d$, that serves as a continuous control parameter representing cultural tolerance. This framework allows for a robust analysis of the model's critical properties and its dynamics under cultural drift (copying noise). For the perfect copying scenario, we precisely locate the critical threshold $d_c$, which separates the disordered (fragmented) and ordered (polarized) phases. Through Finite-Size Scaling, we find that the mean domain density vanishes continuously at $d_c$ with the exponent $\\beta = 1/3$. Simultaneously, the largest domain fraction displays a surprising discontinuous jump at $d_c$. We find that the finite size effects in the critical region are governed by the exponent $\\nu=2$ for both the continuous and discontinuous transitions. Under imperfect copying, persistent noise introduces a powerful selective pressure on the trait space, leading to the emergence of two symmetry-related attractors at the trait values $d$ and $1-d$. However, these noise-induced attractors prove fragile in the thermodynamic limit, becoming unstable at large lattice sizes, which directly accounts for the observed failure of the dynamics to freeze under sustained cultural drift. This suggests that in large, continuously evolving societies, true cultural convergence is highly unlikely, leading instead to sustained fragmentation and nonstationary dynamics where cultural domains never fully stabilize."

      "summary": "Understanding the emergence of complex correlations in strongly interacting systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics. One fruitful approach is to develop solvable toy models that encapsulate universal properties shared by realistic systems. In this work, we introduce the Brownian SYK-Hubbard model, which combines the all-to-all random interactions of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with on-site Hubbard-type interactions. This hybrid construction enables the study of the interplay between nonlocal random dynamics and local correlation effects: (1) As the interaction strength increases, the single-particle spectrum exhibits a transition from a single peak to a two-peak structure, signaling the onset of Mottness. (2) The spectral form factor undergoes a sequence of dynamical transitions as the evolution time increases before reaching the plateau in the long-time limit under strong Hubbard interactions. (3) The out-of-time-order correlator is computed by summing a series of modified ladder diagrams, which determines the quantum Lyapunov exponent and reveals a violation of the bound on branching time. Our results establish a new analytically tractable platform for exploring the effects of Hubbard interactions in chaotic many-body systems."

In recent years, these systems have drawn increasing interest because they provide insight into the mechanisms of thermalization and the situations where it can fail. In this work, we study a family of kinetically constrained models, including the celebrated Quantum Game of Life, from the perspective of quantum complexity, with a focus on entanglement, nonstabilizerness, and signatures of quantum chaos. By applying spectral diagnostics such as level statistics and spectral form factors, we demonstrate that these models show robust chaotic behavior while also supporting Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scar states. Remarkably, we find that even certain symmetry-resolved fragmented sectors can themselves host scarred eigenstates, highlighting the unexpected coexistence of chaos, scars, and fragmentation within the same family of Hamiltonians. To better understand these fragmented subspaces, we further characterize them using their quantum resource generation ability. In particular, we demonstrate that characterization of entanglement and the ability to generate nonstabilizerness can be instrumental in distinguishing different dynamically disconnected sectors."

      "summary": "Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data. Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations."

      "summary": "Quantum thermometry leveraging quantum sensors is investigated with an emphasis on fundamental precision bounds derived from quantum estimation theory. The proposed sensing platform consists of two dissimilar qubits coupled via capacitor, which induce quantum oscillations in the presence of a thermal environment. Thermal equilibrium states are modeled using the Gibbs distribution. The precision limits are assessed through the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the Hilbert-Schmidt Speed (HSS), serving as stringent criteria for sensor sensitivity. Systematic analysis of the dependence of QFI and HSS on tunable parameters -such as qubit energies and coupling strengths- provides optimization pathways for maximizing temperature sensitivity. Furthermore, we explore two distinct quantum thermometry paradigms: (I) local temperature estimation directly performed by Alice, who possesses the quantum sensor interfacing with the thermal bath, and (II) remote temperature estimation conducted by Bob, facilitated via quantum teleportation. In the latter scenario, temperature information encoded in the qubit state is transmitted through a single-qubit quantum thermal teleportation protocol. Our findings indicate that direct measurement yields superior sensitivity compared to remote estimation, primarily due to the inherent advantage of direct sensor-environment interaction. The analysis reveals that increasing Josephson energies diminishes sensor sensitivity, whereas augmenting the mutual coupling strength between the qubits enhances it."

We propose a precise definition of the critical tension for cavitation in transient pressure fields that bridges the gap between quasi-static and dynamic regimes, identifying cavitation as the transition of the bubble radius to a dynamically unstable state. This threshold depends on the instantaneous state of the gas-liquid system and, when combined with an appropriate set of dimensionless parameters, yields a self-similar description of cavitation onset. Phase maps for different liquids reveal a minimum tension required for the onset of cavitation, determined by the duration of the tension event and the initial bubble size, whereby the well-known Blake threshold is the lower bound for cavitation across all conditions."

However, a rigorous theoretical description of the interaction of multiple quantum emitters with complex dispersive dielectric objects remains highly challenging. Here we introduce an approach based on the modified Langevin noise formalism that unveils the roles of both the noise polarization currents of the dielectrics and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field scattered by the dielectrics. This extends Refs. \\cite{miano_quantum_2025}, \\cite{miano_spectral_2025} to the general case of an arbitrary number of emitters. The proposed approach allows us to describe the dynamics of the quantum emitters for arbitrary initial quantum states of the electromagnetic environment consisting of two independent bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density matrix. Understanding how these reservoirs shape emitter dynamics is crucial to understanding light-matter interactions in complex electromagnetic environments and to enhancing intrinsic emitter properties in structured environments."

The formation of bound states usually originates from attractive interactions between particles. However, the binding can also arise purely from the motion of dopants due to kinetic frustration, which is potentially related to unconventional pairing in moir\\'e materials. Here, we report the first direct observation of kinetically-induced bound states between holes and magnons using a Rydberg atom array quantum simulator of the bosonic $t$-$J$ model in frustrated ladders and 2D lattices. First, we demonstrate the formation of mobile one-hole-one-magnon bound states. We then construct three-particle one-hole-two-magnon bound states and reveal the underlying binding mechanism by observing kinetically-induced singlet correlations. Finally, we investigate how mobile dopants structure their magnetic environment in a spin-balanced 2D triangular lattice, showing that a hole induces $120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order, while a doublon dopant generates in-plane ferromagnetic correlations. Our results demonstrates compelling evidence of kinetically-induced binding, opening a new avenue to understand novel pairing mechanisms in correlated quantum materials like superconductors in moir\\'e superlattices."

However, there are examples of intrinsically non-Hermitian, though often $\\mathcal{PT}$ (parity-time) symmetric, not necessarily open systems, in which case the concept of gain and loss relative to an underlying environment is not primordial. A particularly intriguing example with experimental consequences in the literature is QCD at finite density. Motivated by the existence of such inherently non-Hermitian systems, here we study the critical behavior of a $U(1)$-invariant Lagrangian perturbed by a complex, $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric $Z_{4}$ anisotropy. We find real critical exponents both in the region of unbroken and broken $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. In the former the coupling constants for fixed points or lines are real, whereas in the latter they become complex. Importantly, the most stable fixed point corresponds to the flow at large distances towards an effectively Hermitian $U(1)$ symmetric system. This constitutes an example where both the $U(1)$ and the Hermitian character are emergent features of the theory. This tells us about the importance and physical meaning of some non-Hermitian systems beyond interpretations involving gain and loss."

      "summary": "We provide a rigorous random matrix theory analysis of spiked cross-covariance models where the signals across two high-dimensional data channels are partially aligned. These models are motivated by multi-modal learning and form the standard generative setting underlying Partial Least Squares (PLS), a widely used yet theoretically underdeveloped method. We show that the leading singular values of the sample cross-covariance matrix undergo a Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP)-type phase transition, and we characterize the precise thresholds for the emergence of informative components. Our results yield the first sharp asymptotic description of the signal recovery capabilities of PLS in this setting, revealing a fundamental performance gap between PLS and the Bayes-optimal estimator. In particular, we identify the SNR and correlation regimes where PLS fails to recover any signal, despite detectability being possible in principle. These findings clarify the theoretical limits of PLS and provide guidance for the design of reliable multi-modal inference methods in high dimensions."

We investigate the structural and electronic properties of such strained moir\\'{e} patterns in TMD homobilayers. The moir\\'{e} patterns in strained TMDs consist of several stacking domains which are separated by tensile solitons. Relaxation of these systems distributes the strain unevenly in the moir\\'{e} superlattice, with the maximum strain energy concentrating at the highest energy stackings. The order parameter distribution shows the formation of aster topological defects at the same sites. In contrast, twisted TMDs host shear solitons at the domain walls, and the order parameter distribution in these systems shows the formation of vortex defects. The strained moir\\'{e} systems also show the emergence of several well-separated flat bands at both the valence and conduction band edges, and we observe a significant reduction in the band gap. The flat bands in these strained moir\\'{e} superlattices provide platforms for studying the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice as well as the ionic Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice. Furthermore, we study the localization of the wave functions corresponding to these flat bands. The wave functions localize at different stackings compared to twisted TMDs, and our results are in excellent agreement with spectroscopic experiments."

      "summary": "It has recently become clear that phonons generate a sizable thermal Hall effect in cuprates, whether they are undoped, electron-doped or hole-doped (inside the pseudogap phase). At higher doping, where cuprates are reasonably good metals, mobile electrons also generate a thermal Hall effect, the thermal equivalent of the standard electrical Hall effect. Here we show that in the cleanest crystals of the electron-doped cuprate Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$, at high doping, the phonon and electron contributions to the thermal Hall conductivity $\\kappa_{\\rm {xy}}$ are of comparable magnitude, but of opposite sign. In samples of lower quality, phonons dominate $\\kappa_{\\rm {xy}}$, resulting in a negative $\\kappa_{\\rm {xy}}$ at all temperatures. The fact that the negative phononic $\\kappa_{\\rm {xy}}$ in the metallic state is similar in magnitude and temperature dependence to that found in the insulating state at lower doping rules out any mechanism based on skew scattering of phonons off charged impurities, since a local charge should be screened in the metallic regime. The phononic $\\kappa_{\\rm {xy}}$ is found to persist over the entire doping range where antiferromagnetic correlations are known to be significant, suggesting that such correlations may play a role in generating the phonon thermal Hall effect in electron-doped cuprates. If the same mechanism is also at play in hole-doped cuprates, the presence of a phononic $\\kappa_{\\rm {xy}}$ below (and only below) the critical doping $p^{\\star}$ would be evidence that spin correlations are a property of the pseudogap phase."

      "summary": "We study the nonlocal magnetotransport through a strongly correlated quantum dot, connected to multiple terminals consisting of two normal and one superconducting (SC) leads. Specifically, we present a comprehensive view on the interplay between the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR), the Kondo effect, and the Zeeman splitting at zero temperature in the large SC gap limit. The ground state of this network shows an interesting variety, which varies continuously with the system parameters, such as the coupling strength $\\Gamma_S^{}$ between the SC lead and the quantum dot, the Coulomb repulsion $U$, the impurity level $\\varepsilon_d^{}$, and the magnetic field $b$. We show, using the many-body optical theorem which is derived from the Fermi-liquid theory, that the nonlocal conductance is determined by the transmission rate of the Cooper pairs $\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{CP}}^{} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sin^2 \\Theta\\, \\sin^2 \\bigl(\\delta_{\\uparrow}+ \\delta_{\\downarrow})$ and that of the Bogoliubov particles $\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{BG}}^{}= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\sigma} \\sin^2 \\delta_{\\sigma}^{}$. Here, $\\delta_\\sigma^{}$ is the phase shift of the renormalized Bogoliubov particles, and $\\Theta \\equiv \\cot^{-1} (\\xi_d^{}/ \\Gamma_S^{})$ is the Bogoliubov-rotation angle in the Nambu pseudo spin space, with $\\xi_d^{} =\\varepsilon_d^{}+U/2$. It is also demonstrated, using Wilson's numerical renormalization group approach, that the CAR is enhanced in the crossover region between the Kondo regime and the SC-proximity-dominated regime at zero magnetic field. The magnetic fields induce another crossover between the Zeeman-dominated regime and the SC-dominated regime. We find that the CAR is enhanced and becomes less sensitive to magnetic fields in the SC-dominated regime close to the crossover region spreading over the angular range of $\\pi/4 \\lesssim \\Theta \\lesssim 3\\pi/4$."

Using the numerical renormalization group method, we map out the evolution of the ground state across a wide parameter space of level detunings, size of the superconducting gap, lead couplings, and inter-dot coupling strength. The intricate phase diagrams feature singlet, doublet, and a relatively uncommon triplet ground states, with the latter being a distinct signature of strong lead-mediated interactions between the quantum dots. We benchmark the applicability of simplified effective models, including the atomic limit and zero-bandwidth approximations, in capturing the complex behavior of this parallel configuration. Our analysis reveals severe limitations of these models, underscoring the necessity for maximal caution when extrapolating beyond their tested validity. In particular, all effective models except for the extended version of the zero-bandwidth approximation failed in reproducing the triplet ground state and made several false predictions. These findings provide crucial insights for interpreting experimental observations and designing superconducting devices based on quantum-dot architectures."

      "summary": "Gaining control over chemical reactions on the quantum level is a central goal of the modern field of cold and ultracold chemistry. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to coherently steer reaction flux of a three-body recombination process across different product spin channels. For this, we employ a magnetically-tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows for the control of the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to significantly change the reaction products. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics. We find that while the Efimov resonance can be used to globally enhance three-body recombination, the relative flux between the reaction channels remains unchanged. Our control scheme is general and can be extended to other reaction processes. It also provides new opportunities in combination with other control schemes, such as quantum interference of reaction paths."

      "summary": "Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead, also known as the interacting resonant level model in quantum impurity physics. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits."

In particular, modeling ionic diffusion in solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) requires methods that can overcome the scale limitations of traditional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate MD simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 SSE candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales."

Both the experimentally observed smeared region and the theoretically predicted marginal Fermi liquid suggest that spatial disorder seems to be an important driver of these phenomena. By performing large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations in the ferromagnetic spin-fermion model at finite $N$, beyond the large-$N$ used in previous theoretical work, we investigated the role of spatial disorder in the critical Fermi surface (FS) of this model. We proposed a corrected theory of our system, which is based on a modified Eliashberg theory and a universal theory of strange metals. This theory agrees well with the data obtained from DQMC, particularly in capturing the $\\omega \\ln \\omega$ type self-energy characteristic of marginal Fermi liquid behavior, and observing the linear-in-temperature resistivity. Our findings offer strong and unbiased validation of the universal theory of strange metals, broaden the applicability of the modified Eliashberg theory, and provide insights for numerically searching for marginal Fermi liquid and linear-in-temperature resistivity."

Recent developments of quantum-enabled magnetometers, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, have enabled direct imaging of magnetic field distributions across a wide range of magnetic profiles. However, reconstructing the magnetization from an experimentally measured magnetic field map is a complex inverse problem, further complicated by measurement noise, finite spatial resolution, and variations in sample-to-sensor distance. In this work, we present a novel and efficient GPU-accelerated method for reconstructing spatially varying magnetization density from measured magnetic fields with minimal prior assumptions. We validate our method by simulating diverse magnetic structures under realistic experimental conditions, including multi-domain ferromagnetism and magnetic spin textures such as skyrmion, anti-skyrmion, and meron. Experimentally, we reconstruct the magnetization of a micrometer-scale Apollo lunar mare basalt (sample 10003,184) and a nanometer-scale twisted double-trilayer CrI3. The basalt exhibits soft ferromagnetic domains consistent with previous paleomagnetic studies, whereas the CrI3 system reveals a well-defined hexagonal magnetic Moire superlattice. Our approach provides a versatile and universal tool for investigating complex magnetization profiles, paving the way for future quantum sensing experiments."

      "summary": "Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed \"fractionalized prethermalization\". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponentially long lifetime of a Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms."

      "summary": "We consider unsteady ballistic heat transport in a semi-infinite Hooke chain with a free end and an arbitrary heat source. An analytical description of the evolution of the kinetic temperature is proposed in both discrete (exact) and continuum (approximate) formulations. The continualization of the discrete solution for kinetic temperature is performed through a large-time asymptotic estimate of the fundamental solution of the dynamical problem for the instantly perturbed conservative semi-infinite chain at the fronts of the incident and reflected thermal waves. By analyzing the continuum solution, we observe that any instantaneous heat supply (i.e., a heat pulse) results in the anti-localization of the reflected thermal wave. We demonstrate that sudden point heat supply leads to a transition to a non-equilibrium steady state, which, unexpectedly, may exist even in the non-dissipative case. The results of this paper are expected to provide insight into the continuum description of nanoscale heat transport."

      "summary": "Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of inertial active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and wave memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have previously been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. Inspired by the rich dynamics of strongly interacting superwalking droplets in experiments, we numerically investigate the dynamics of WPE clusters using a stroboscopic model. We find that several interacting WPEs self-organize into a stable bound cluster, reminiscent of an atomic nucleus. This active cluster exhibits a rich spectrum of collective excitations, including shape oscillations and chiral rotating modes, akin to vibrational and rotational modes of nuclear excitations, as the spatial extent of the waves and their temporal decay rate (memory) are varied. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective wave field potential, bearing qualitative similarities with the nuclear shell model and the bag model of hadrons. For high memory and rapid spatial decay of waves, the active cluster becomes unstable and disintegrates; however, within a narrow regime of the parameter space, the cluster ejects single particles whose decay statistics follow exponential laws, reminiscent of radioactive nuclear decay. Our study uncovers a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors in clusters of active particles, opening new avenues for exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in active matter systems."

      "summary": "Three-body loss resonances associated with heavy-heavy-light Efimov states have been observed for over a decade in ultracold mixtures tuned near interspecies Feshbach resonances. For light-light-heavy systems, observing such resonances has been far more challenging due to the substantially large Efimov spacing. In these Efimov-unfavored systems, the intraspecies scattering length $a_\\text{BB}$ has been shown to significantly affect the overall Efimov scenario, namely, the positions of the Efimov resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ and the three-body parameter (3BP) $a_{-}^{(0)}$. The present article explains the origin behind this influence by highlighting two primary mechanisms via which both the magnitude and sign of $a_\\text{BB}$ govern the Efimov spectrum and set the resulting 3BP $a_{-}^{(0)}$. By employing van der Waals interactions for $^{23}$Na$_2{}^{40}$K, we attribute the vital role of $a_\\text{BB}$ in Efimov-unfavored systems to the large difference between the Efimov scaling parameters for two and three resonant interactions, $s_0$ and $s_0^*$. In particular, we account for the unusually large $a_{-}^{(0)}$ obtained in light-light-heavy systems with $a_\\text{BB}>0$ (e.g., $^{41}$K$_2{}^{87}$Rb), and show that the first Efimov resonance can still occur at an experimentally accessible value when $a_\\text{BB}<0$."

By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-equivalent DSSF closely matches Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for kBT/J ~ 1, extending the applicability of classical dynamics to the challenging case of gapless excitations. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions for uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Entanglement witnesses derived from the quantum-equivalent DSSF act as sensitive diagnostics for the quantum-to-classical crossover. Their reliability stems from their dependence on spectral features alone, enabling classical dynamics to emulate quantum thresholds without genuine entanglement. This framework also reproduces transverse spin correlations in finite magnetic fields, in agreement with quantum simulations. Together, our results establish quantum-corrected classical dynamics as a scalable and predictive tool for interpreting scattering experiments and exploring quantum correlations in strongly correlated spin systems."

Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal nonlocal anticorrelations in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum."

      "summary": "Superconducting thin metallic films, functioning as supercurrent gate-tunable transistors, have considerable potential for future quantum electronic devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive microscopic quantitative mechanism that elucidates the control or suppression of supercurrents in thin films remains elusive. Focusing on NbN, a prototypical material, and starting from a phenomenological ansatz that links the critical electric field with the kinetic energy parameter needed to break Cooper pairs, we provide a quantitative analysis of the critical current using Eliashberg theory in the dirty limit without adjustable parameters. The critical kinetic energy value is identified, corresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The peak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy arises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased kinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes sufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is subsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric field required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is in parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations. Although the disorder reduces the temperature dependence of the gating effect on the critical current, at the same time, it increases the unscreened critical electric field needed to suppress superconductivity. This enables the proposal of methods to control and reduce the critical field value necessary to suppress superconductivity in superconducting electronics."

      "summary": "With its huge entropy change and a strong interplay between magnetic order, structural and electrical properties, the first-order antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic phase transition is a paradigmatic example of the multicaloric effect. The unraveling of the physics underlying the phase transition needs a better understanding of the thermal hysteresis of FeRh within the AF-FM phase coexistence region. In this work, we compare the effect of two very different types of thermal cycling on the hysteresis of the magnetic order: quasi-static heating, and cooling of the entire 195 nm thick film, and a f =100 kHz modulated heating driven by a laser focused down to a spot of about ten microns squared at the film surface. Taking advantage of the reflectivity difference between both phases to probe optically their respective fraction, we show that whereas only temperature-driven reflectivity variations ($dR/dT$, thermoreflectance) are detected in the pure phases, a huge modulation of the phase-dependent reflectance at the driving frequency $f$ is detected in the phase coexistence temperature range. This is quantitatively described as resulting from a substantial modulation of the FM fraction (up to 90% with increasing laser power. A simplified rate-independent hysteresis model with return-point-memory (RPM), represented in terms of bistable units that undergo a temperature excursion corresponding to a given laser power, reproduces very well the optically measured FM phase modulation characteristics for a broad range of temperature excursions. This offers an insight into the leading role of quenched disorder in defining thermal hysteresis in FeRh under high excitation frequency, when the material is periodically driven out-of-equilibrium."

Here we introduce the first theoretical model of electrochemical Ostwald ripening, capturing the competition between electroplating and surface-energy-driven redistribution and identifying it as the governing process behind morphology evolution in the non-dendritic regime. The framework explicitly incorporates SEI resistance, electrolyte conductivity, electrode wettability, and current density revealing the transition from 2D SEI-limited to 3D electrolyte-limited growth. The model yields analytical expressions for nucleus size, density and distribution that quantitatively reproduce independent experimental results and establishes a direct link between plating conditions, morphology, and Coulombic efficiency. By providing experimentally accessible relationships between key parameters and deposition outcomes, the framework enables predictive understanding of lithium plating and provides a broadly applicable basis for controlling electrodeposition morphology across diverse electrochemical systems."

We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between the intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to different phases. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes."

Here, we investigate the effects of nonlinearity on the non-Hermitian skin effect, a well-known non-Hermitian phenomenon induced by the point-gap topology unique to non-Hermitian systems. Interestingly, we discover a nonlinearity-induced point-gap topological phase transition accompanied by a reversal of the skin mode localization, which is distinct from previous nonlinearity-induced line-gap topological phases. This phenomenon is experimentally demonstrated in a nonlinear microwave metamaterial, where electromagnetic waves are localized around one end of the sample under a low-intensity pump, whereas at a high-intensity pump, the waves are localized around the other end. Our results open a new route towards nonlinear topological physics in non-Hermitian systems and are promising for reconfigurable topological wave manipulation."

Here, we develop a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach to study the proximity effect of local piezoelectric response and polarization reversal in wurtzite ferroelectric multilayers under a sharp electrically biased tip. Using finite element modeling we analyze the probe-induced nucleation of nanodomains, the features of local polarization hysteresis loops and coercive fields in the Al1-xScxN/AlN bilayers and three-layers. Similar to the wurtzite multilayers sandwiched between two parallel electrodes, the regimes of \"proximity switching\" (where the multilayers collectively switch) and the regime of \"proximity suppression\" (where they collectively do not switch) are the only two possible regimes in the probe-electrode geometry. However, the parameters and asymmetry of the local piezo-response and polarization hysteresis loops depend significantly on the sequence of the layers with respect to the probe. The physical mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity in the local probe geometry is a depolarizing electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness. The field, whose direction is opposite to the polarization vector in the layer(s) with the larger spontaneous polarization (such as AlN), renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier in the \"otherwise unswitchable\" polar layers. Tip-based control of domains in otherwise non-ferroelectric layers using proximity ferroelectricity can provide nanoscale control of domain reversal in memory, actuation, sensing and optical applications."

Based on a recently proposed kinetic description for ABP, we derive Navier-Stokes-like equations for the density and polarization fields in this regime. Using the Chapman-Enskog method, all transport coefficients in the equations are obtained entirely in terms of the microscopic dynamics. A linear stability analysis of the homogeneous and isotropic state shows that the derived equations correctly describe the density instability associated to the motility induced phase separation. Numerical solutions of the equations in one spatial dimension show the need of an additional regularizing pressure term to saturate the system at high densities. With the inclusion of this term, the solutions illustrate in detail the clustering dynamics, with the formation of polarized regions at the interfaces, and the subsequent coarsening of domains, as well as particle accumulation in presence of gravity. Finally, the derived equations imply that, as an effect of the coupling with the polarization, damped density wave modes appear in the system which were verified with numerical simulations."

      "summary": "The paper demonstrates that the canonical probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a bosonic system is multinomial and shows how the thermodynamics of the canonical system descends from this distribution. The categorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) of the multinomial distribution should be derived from constrained maximization of the entropy of the multinomial distribution, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper proposes to take instead the one-particle Boltzmann distribution. After this, the imposition of Clausius' equation on the Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution leads to an unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ that imposes the energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be substantially different from the inverse temperature. To disprove that $\\beta$ should be equal to the inverse temperature, the paper presents an example where, with $\\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. But this would contradict the principle of maximum entropy."

The multiorbital degeneracy of singly-occupied V states in the nominally 4+ ionic state is broken by magnetism, reduced symmetry, and local distortion, causing a single one-electron majority state per V atom to be occupied. A gap of order 1 eV thus survives at all V concentrations, and intrinsic polarization is preserved, at the level of two-thirds the hafnia value. Ferromagnetic magnetization is found to increase linearly with V content, with values of 30-40 emu/cm3 at concentrations near the end of the stability range."

      "summary": "Developing materials with tailored mechanical performance requires iteration over a large number of proposed designs. When considering dynamic fracture, experiments at every iteration are usually infeasible. While high-fidelity, physics-based simulations can potentially reduce experimental efforts, they remain computationally expensive. As a faster alternative, key dynamic properties can be predicted directly from microstructural images using deep-learning surrogate models. In this work, the spallation of ductile polycrystals under plate-impact loading at strain rates of O(10^6 s^-1) is considered. A physics-based numerical model that couples crystal plasticity and a cohesive zone model is used to generate data for the surrogate models. Three architectures - 3D U-Net, 3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-3D), and U-FNO were trained on the particle-velocity field data from the numerical model. The generalization of the models was evaluated using microstructures with varying grain sizes and aspect ratios. U-FNO and 3D U-Net performed significantly better than FNO-3D across all datasets. Furthermore, U-FNO and 3D U-Net exhibited comparable accuracy for every metric considered in this study. However, training the U-FNO requires almost twice the computational effort compared to the 3D U-Net, making it a desirable option for a surrogate model."

      "summary": "Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \\textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies."

By addressing the residual effects after a renormalization process, a small number of macroscopic degrees of freedom can effectively replace the infinite number of microscopic degrees of freedom, emphasizing the significant role of dimensionality and the intrinsic characteristics of the system in understanding and analyzing transitions. We highlight several non-universal characteristics of continuous phase transitions near the transition temperature, including the non-monotonic relationship between the critical temperature and dimensionality, as well as the enhancement or disappearance of the specific heat jump in complex superconductors. While the resulting expressions for thermodynamic quantities are complex for one-dimensional systems, obeying Mermin-Wagner's theorem, they are considerably simplified for two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems."

      "summary": "Thermal and electrical injection and transport of magnon spins in magnetic insulators is conventionally understood by the non-equilibrium population of magnons. However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in noncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation at the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is described by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by population -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our quantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors creates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins in canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between magnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon correlation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes dephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are enhanced by magnetic fields. Spin transfer to proximity conductors can cause extrinsic dephasing, which suppresses spin oscillations and thereby gates spin transport."

We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles calculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function techniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate multi-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near melting points. Our calculations reveal dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si even at high temperatures, they become increasingly important in MgO near its melting point (3100~K) and in BaO at intermediate temperatures (1200~K). Most remarkably, five- and six-phonon scatterings surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity in BaO near its melting point (2100~K), reducing lattice thermal conductivity by over 50\\%. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work provides theoretical insights into the lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures."

Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures (down to 2 K), outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements along with microstructural and compositional analyses, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications."

      "summary": "In this paper, we investigate the impact of nonlocal correlations on charge fluctuations in the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model close to the Mott metal-to-insulator transition, employing the ladder dynamical vertex approximation. At half filling and for interaction strengths and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence, carried out ladder dynamical vertex approximation (lD$\\Gamma$A) simulations which allow for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the local ones of DMFT. Our lD$\\Gamma$A numerical data show that close to half filling the large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain doping value, charge fluctuations eventually become larger in lD$\\Gamma$A with respect to DMFT, indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime. This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the lD$\\Gamma$A kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute value of the) lD$\\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT."

In two dimensions, we derive the exact equations for the positional probability distribution $\\phi({\\bf r})$ of ABP ($n\\geq 2)$ and RTP ($n=2$), whose solutions are obtained under the assumption that the particle's orientation angle is Gaussian. Both analytical and numerical results show that, in all cases, $\\phi({\\bf r})$ has compact support and undergoes a phase transition-like shape change as a function of the trap strength. For ABP, our theory predicts a continuous transition in shape for $n=2$ and a discontinuous transition for $n>2$, both of which agree with the simulation results. Simulations suggest the existence of both types of shape transition in the case of RTP as well. For ABP, in the strongly active regime, the orientational probability distribution is unimodal near the outer boundary but becomes bimodal towards the interior, signifying a transition from predominantly radial orientation to orbiting motion. In RTP, the analogous shape transition in the orientational distribution is almost absent."

Here it is shown that a $1/f^{\\alpha}$ spectral density, with $\\alpha = 3/2$, can arise in the response of an ensemble of two--level systems coupled to a heat bath by means of a system of Bosonic quasiparticles. The model considered is the classic model of Faughnan and Strandberg of the phonon bottleneck, and the anomalous response is associated with an approximate non-equilibrium steady state of the phonons maintained by slow spin relaxation. The frequency dependence of the response to an applied field is calculated analytically, revealing the emergence, in the limit of a strong bottleneck, of $\\alpha=3/2$ behaviour over a diverging range of frequencies. The application of this result to experimental systems is discussed and comparisons are drawn with other systems that exhibit anomalous relaxation."

In such a trap, the gas is known to exhibit Josephson oscillations, which rely on the coherence between the potential wells. Applying the density matrix approach, we consider transitions between the coherent, partially incoherent, and fully incoherent states of the Bose gas. We provide an analytical description of the collisional decoherence due to weak interactions, causing the Josephson oscillations to decay with time. In particular, we give the mathematical link between that decay in the density matrix approach and its interpretation in terms of phase fluctuations. To investigate the potential of the double-well setup as a quantum sensor we apply additional external acceleration to the system. The interplay of collisional interaction and ac- celeration leads to an additional shift of the oscillation frequency. We give the analytical expression for this shift and estimate the sensitivity of a hypothetical BEC double-well accelerometer based on that effect."

The phase behavior of the system is studied for various compositions ($x$) of the C-type particles, ranging from $x = 0.1$ to $0.9$. The results show that a structurally ordered complex is formed with the S- and C-types in the fluid-like environment of U-type particles, for $x \\in \\lbrace 0.5 - 0.6\\rbrace$. The time-averaged hexatic order parameter $\\left\\langle \\Psi_{6} \\right\\rangle$ indicates that the dynamical segregation of S- and C-types exhibits a positional order, that is found to be maximum for $x$ in the range of 0.5 - 0.6.

The CoSn films exhibited relatively low \\r{ho} along [0001], reaching 13 micro{\\Omega} cm for films thickner than 50 nm, and an approximately tenfold anisotropy of \\r{ho} between [0001] and [2-1-10] (a-axis), consistent with previous reports on bulk CoSn single crystals. However, the CoSn(10-10) surface exhibited pronounced roughness, attributed to three-dimensional crystal growth during sputtering, which hinders accurate evaluation of the thickness dependence of resistivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the growth of a CoSn(10-10) single-crystal with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets, as well as domain boundaries within the films. These results highlight both the potential and challenges of employing CoSn kagome metal in future interconnect technologies."

Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that are consistent with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons."

Going beyond the simple few-particle trion picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the rate of the direct optical conversion process which has a threshold where the terahertz photon energy equals to the Fermi polaron binding energy. This process features a characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold, due to final-state electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on the electron temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in two-dimensional semiconductors."

In this study, the substitution of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ at the magnetic Ir$^{4+}$-site leads to a systematic decrease in unit cell volume keeping the monoclinic symmetry throughout, reflecting the effect of chemical pressure along with a gradual suppression of magnetic interactions. The parent compound ($x =$ 0) exhibits a ferromagnetic-like state with a Curie temperature of 92 K, which continuously evolves into an antiferromagnetic ground state upon full Ti substitution ($x =$ 1) with a Neel temperature of 14.6 K. Isothermal magnetization measurements reveal a hysteresis behavior with step-like feature at zero field, indicative of a noncollinear magnetic ordering. Additionally, the enhancement of magnetization under hydrostatic pressure on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ suggests the presence of piezomagnetic behavior. Thermal expansion measurements on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ highlight a coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. The pressure dependence of the transition temperature in the zero-pressure limit, calculated using Ehrenfest's relation, shows good agreement with magnetization data under applied pressure. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations preformed for $x =$ 0, 0.5 and 1, further reveal that strong SOC associated with Ir plays a decisive role in shaping the electronic band structure, with the insulating gap progressively widening as Ti content increases from 0.28 eV ($x =$ 0), 0.44 eV ($x =$ 0.5), and 1.01 eV ($x =$ 1). The magnetic moment decreased more than 50\\% for $x =$ 0.5, showing the decrease in magnetic exchange pathways."

A common approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework for moir\\'e systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle corrections. We apply this framework to hexagonal boron nitride aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We show that incorporating RPA correlation energy and $GW$ self-energy corrections yields phase diagrams and single-particle spectra that quantitatively align with experimental measurements. Our versatile framework provides a systematic beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moir\\'e systems."

Yet how activity and flexibility jointly govern their organization, especially Isotropic-Nematic (I-N) transition, remains poorly understood. Performing large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of 3D active semiflexible polymers with varying flexibility degrees, we show that tangential active forces systematically shift the I-N transition to higher densities, with the shift controlled by the flexibility degree and activity strength. Strikingly, activity alters the nature of the transition: discontinuous at low strengths, continuous at moderate strengths, and ultimately suppressed at high activity levels. The delayed I-N transition originates from enhanced collective bending fluctuations, resulting in chain shrinkage and enlargement of effective confinement tube. At moderate activity levels, these fluctuations can trigger large-scale excitations that stochastically drive temporal transitions between nematic and isotropic states, indicating an activity-induced instability of the nematic field. We summarize this behavior in non-equilibrium state diagrams of density and activity for different flexibility degrees."

      "summary": "Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality."

We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \\geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle."

They exhibit low exciton binding energies (18.85-26.81 meV), large Bohr radii (23-34.3 Angstrom), and moderate exciton temperatures (218-311 K), which are favorable for photovoltaic applications. Their performance as solar cells was simulated using the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film devices with Pt/CdS/CdGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti and Pt/CdS/ZnGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti structures. We investigated the effects of layer thickness, donor and acceptor concentrations (shallow donors/acceptors), and defect density on device performance. The ideal absorber thickness for XGa2Te4 (X = Cd, Zn) was found to be 1000-1800 nm, and the CdS buffer layer around 100 nm. To obtain an efficiency above 20%, the defect density in the CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 absorber layers should be kept below 1.772 x 10^13 cm^-3.

In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\\pi$/2$\\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires."

Recently, dynamic phase transitions of athermal particles under periodic shear provide a new lens on this problem, leading to a conjecture that jamming transition corresponds to an absorbing-state transition within the Manna (conserved directed percolation) universality class. Here, by re-examining the biased random organization model, a minimal model for particles under periodic shearing that the conjecture is based on, we uncover several criticality anomalies at high density at odds with Manna universality class. In three-dimensional monodisperse systems, we find crystallization disrupts the absorbing transition, while in dense binary mixtures, a distinct transition from absorbing to active-glass states emerges, signifying a new universality class of dynamic phase transition. Closer to the jamming point, the quenched heterogeneity in the contact network smears the dynamic transition via Griffiths effects and drives the system toward heterogeneous directed percolation. We propose a field theory with fractional time dynamics that unifies these phenomena, establishing a theoretical framework linking jamming, disorder, and dynamic criticality."

By solving the corresponding linearized system in an exact fashion, we identify the conditions under which the GS phase transitions occur, thus transforming excited states into GS. The study of the full nonlinear system, including both density-density and spin-spin interactions, is numerically analyzed. For the case of repulsive spin-spin interactions, the results resemble the linear case, while attractive spin-spin interactions lead to the formation of mixed-states near the GS phase-transition points. Additionally, higher-order vortex solitons are found to be stable even in the nonlinear regime. These findings demonstrate that arbitrary winding numbers can be achieved as corresponding to stable GS and thus contributing to the understanding of topological properties in SOC BECs."

Progress in this topic has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density ($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$ devices with varying long-range ($n_\\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range ($n_\\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the magnitude of $n_\\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\\mathrm{SR} \\lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\\mathrm{SR} \\gg n_e$ these features are suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher $n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a combined experimental-theoretical approach."

Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases.

When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum.

Utilizing the mixed-field toric code and PXP Rydberg Hamiltonian models, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N = 480 for toric code, N=1584 for Rydberg PXP), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures."

It is well known that abstraction emerges with depth in neural networks, where deep layers capture abstract characteristics of data by combining lower level features encoded in shallow layers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop truly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction crucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within a renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to encompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this transformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for a representation which is absolutely abstract. This theoretical picture is tested in numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks and auto-encoders trained on data of different breadth. These show that representations in neural networks approach the Hierarchical Feature Model as the data get broader and as depth increases, in agreement with theoretical predictions."

In this work, we derive an analytical expression for the time-averaged quantum Fisher information (QFI), enabling the detection of scalable multipartite entanglement dynamically generated by all quantum chaotic systems governed by Dyson's ensembles. Our approach integrates concepts of randomness and quantum chaos, demonstrating that the QFI is universally determined by the structure and dimension of the Krylov space that confines the chaotic dynamics. In particular, the QFI ranges from $N^2/3$ for $N$ qubits in the permutation-symmetric subspace (e.g. for chaotic kicked top models with long-range interactions), to $N$ when the dynamics extend over the full Hilbert space with or without bit reversal symmetry or parity symmetry (e.g. in chaotic models with short-range Ising-like interactions). In the former case, the QFI reveals multipartite entanglement among $N/3$ qubits and highlights the power of chaotic collective spin systems in generating scalable multipartite entanglement. Interestingly this result can be related to isotropic substructures in the Wigner distribution of chaotic states and demonstrates the efficacy of quantum chaos for Heisenberg-scaling quantum metrology. Finally, our general expression for the QFI agrees with that obtained for random states and, differently from out-of-time-order-correlators, it can also distinguish chaotic from integrable unstable spin dynamics."

Through a first-order perturbative analysis of the leading eigenvector of the supra-contact probability matrix, we derive an analytical expression for the fictive coupling $p^*$ that marks the crossover between the two regimes. This result reproduces and explains previously observed numerical scalings and extends them to a broad class of contact-based processes beyond the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model. We also obtain an analytical expression for the IPR of the non-dominant layer in the localized regime, confirming its power-law dependence on the coupling with exponent $\\alpha=4$. Finally, we study the transition between non-dominant and dominant layers as a function of the intra-layer activity parameter $\\gamma$. Our analytical findings are supported by dynamical simulations that highlight distinct susceptibility patterns across regimes. Altogether, this work provides a unified spectral framework for understanding localization and dominance transitions in multiplex contagion dynamics."

In a theoretical model capturing the essential physics of Dirac electrons in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. By using experimental Fermi velocities of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, our results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$."

By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization."

This nonthermal expansion generates a density decrease that enable surface-initiated melting far below equilibrium melting temperatures, creating electronic pressure-driven solid-liquid interface propagation at a high speed of 2500 m/s -- tenfold faster than that of thermal heterogeneous melting mechanisms. Simulated time-resolved X-ray diffraction signatures distinguish this nonthermal expansion from thermal expansion dynamics driven by thermoelastic stress.

Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\\eta_\\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\\eta_\\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B>B_c$ as $T\\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\\eta_\\parallel/s$ for $B<B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point."

The leading anomalous dimensions of some boundary operators are derived from the bulk multiplet recombination and analyticity constraints. We find that the $\\epsilon^{1/2}$ expansion in the $\\phi^6$-tricritical version of the special transition extends to other multicritical cases with larger odd integer $n$, and most of the higher derivative cases involve a noninteger power expansion in $\\epsilon$. Using the analytic bootstrap, we further verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with boundary crossing symmetry."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) achieve deep, non-invasive sensing in turbid media, but they are constrained by the photon budget. Wavefront shaping (WFS) can enhance signal strength via interference at specific locations within scattering media, enhancing light-matter interactions and potentially extending the penetration depth of these techniques. Interpreting the resulting measurements rests on the knowledge of optical sensitivity - a relationship between detected signal changes and perturbations at a specific location inside the medium. However, conventional diffusion-based sensitivity models rely on assumptions that become invalid under coherent illumination. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory for optical sensitivity that captures the inherent interference effects that diffusion theory necessarily neglects. We analytically show that under random illumination, the microscopic and diffusive treatments coincide. Using our microscopic approach, we explore WFS strategies for enhancing optical sensitivity beyond the diffusive result. We demonstrate that the input state obtained through phase conjugation at a given point inside the system leads to the largest enhancement of optical sensitivity but requires an input wavefront that depends on the target position. In sharp contrast, the maximum remission eigenchannel leads to a global enhancement of the sensitivity map with a fixed input wavefront. This global enhancement equals to remission enhancement and preserves the spatial distribution of the sensitivity, making it compatible with existing DOT reconstruction algorithms. Our results establish the theoretical foundation for integrating wavefront control with diffuse optical imaging, enabling deeper tissue penetration through improved signal strength in biomedical applications."

However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a probe of multipolar anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\\theta$-even) and time-reversal-odd ($\\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a multipolar phonon, a three-dimensional and alternating displacement resembling the chiral phonon, plays a vital role in the proposed optical phenomena. Our findings open a pathway for identifying multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and versatile probe."

In this work, we present a quantum treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image contrast.

Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of Poincar\\'e revivals. Our study of quantum recurrence provides new insight into how thermalization emerges in isolated quantum systems."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has been demonstrated in both closed and open Hermitian quantum systems. While some studies have linked the QMPE to Liouvillian exceptional points--non-Hermitian features emerged at the Liouvillian level--in open Hermitian quantum systems, it remains largely unexplored whether the QMPE can occur in intrinsic non-Hermitian systems, where non-Hermiticity is inherent at the Hamiltonian level. Here, we demonstrate unequivocally the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable parity-time-symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Using established quantifiers for QMPE, we show numerically that the QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian and Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when Hermitian Hamiltonian is restored. Interestingly, neither Hamiltonian nor Liouvillian exceptional points demarcate the boundaries of the QMPE regime. To complement numerical results, we develop an analytical description based on a long-time approximation of the relaxation dynamics of quantifiers. This approach allows us to decipher the number of intersections between two dynamical trajectories of quantifier starting from two initial conditions in the validity regime of the long-time approximation, thereby providing additional information that delineate the parameter regimes supporting the genuine QMPE. We further demonstrate the robustness of QMPE against increasing the number of qubits and dephasing effect. Our findings not only broaden the scope of the QMPE but also suggest its intricate interplay with non-Hermitian features beyond exceptional points."

Focusing on models with an exact duality between an SPTP and a trivial one, namely the dimerized XX and the Cluster-Ising chains, we show that dual points exhibit identical amounts of magic, even thought they belong to distinct topological sectors. A subextensive asymmetry arises only under open boundary conditions, where edge effects break the duality, but this correction is non-topological and depends on microscopic parameters. These results stand in contrast to the case of topological frustration, where delocalized excitations enhance the magic logarithmically with system size. They also complement recent analyses in the literature, showing that the total magic is largely insensitive to the presence of topological order, hence suggesting that topological order is not necessarily a genuine computational resource."

We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics."

As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy (\"Hypothesis H\")."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The well-established non-Bloch band theory predicts exponential localization of skin-mode eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies, however, have uncovered anomalous algebraic localization in higher dimensions. Here, we extend these ideas to Hermitian bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians incorporating quantum squeezing, offering a genuine quantum framework to explore non-Hermitian phenomena without external reservoirs. We construct a two-dimensional (2D) bosonic lattice model with two-mode squeezing and study its spectral properties of bosonic excitation within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We demonstrate an algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by quasi-long-range power-law localization of complex eigenstates. The system shows ultra spectral sensitivity to double infinitesimal on-site and long-range hopping impurities, while remaining insensitive to single impurities. Analytical treatment via the Green's function reveals that this sensitivity originates from the divergence of the nonlocal Green's function associated with the formation of nonlocal bound states between impurities. Our study establishes a framework for realizing novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics in Hermitian bosonic platforms such as superconducting circuits, photonic lattices, and optomechanical arrays, with the demonstrated ultraspectral sensitivity enabling quantum sensing and amplification via bosonic squeezing."

Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology has been used to develop a range of cryogenic electronic components for the control and readout of different qubit modalities interfaced on separate chips. However, recent measurements of quantum dots on this technology raise the tantalising prospect of realising control electronics and spin qubits on the same manufacturing platform, within a single integrated circuit (IC). Here, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout in addressable quantum dot devices within an IC fabricated using industry-standard 22 nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology. We achieve spin-to-charge conversion via a ramped energy-selective measurement, detected using a radio-frequency single-electron transistor and addressed by on-chip cryogenic electronics. The observation of consistent readout visibilities exceeding 90% and millisecond spin relaxation times in two nominally identical devices within the addressable array supports the reproducibility of the unit cell. The successful observation of spin readout using this CMOS process marks a key step towards realising highly scalable and integrated spin qubits."

Here, the authors design dual warhead drug conjugates by tethering a platinum pharmacophore to the doxorubicin backbone, which exhibit the activity of both parent anticancer compounds and can overcome drug efflux effectively due to covalent binding to intracellular biomolecules."
