      "summary": "Rotating the clamped ends of a buckled elastica induces a snap-through instability. Predicting the limit point and determining the equilibria at the start and end of the snap are routine computations in the quasi-static setting. The instability itself, however, is dynamic, and quite violently so. We propose an energy-preserving nonlinear single degree of freedom model for this dynamic phenomenon in the case of a symmetrically deforming elastica. The model hinges on a surprising observation relating elastica profiles during the free dynamic snap with a specific sequence of geometrically-constrained elastic energy minimizing configurations. We corroborate this phenomenological observation over a significant range of arch depths through experiments and finite element simulations. The resulting model does not rely on modal expansions, explicit slowness assumptions, or linearization of the arch's kinematics. Instead, the model is effective because its solutions approximate the action integral well. The model provides distinctive computational benefits and new insights into the snap-through phenomenon. Our study is motivated by an application harnessing snap-through instabilities in submerged ribbons for underwater propulsion. We briefly describe its novel working principle and discuss its relationship to the problem studied."

      "summary": "Self-driving labs (SDLs) promise faster materials discovery by coupling automation with machine learning, but a central challenge is predicting costly, slow-to-measure properties from inexpensive, automatable readouts. We address this for doped conjugated polymers by learning interpretable spectral fingerprints from optical spectroscopy to predict electrical conductivity. Optical spectra are fast, non-destructive, and sensitive to aggregation and charge generation; we automate their featurization by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations over adaptively selected spectral windows. These data-driven spectral features, together with processing parameters, are used to train a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) linking optical response and processing to conductivity. To improve accuracy and interpretability in the small-data regime, we add domain-knowledge-based feature expansions and apply SHAP-guided selection to retain a compact, physically meaningful feature set. The pipeline is evaluated under a leak-free train/test protocol, and GA is repeated to assess feature stability. The data-driven model matches the performance of a baseline built from expert-curated descriptors while reducing experimental effort (about 33%) by limiting direct conductivity measurements. Combining data-driven and expert features yields a hybrid QSPR with superior predictive performance, highlighting productive human-ML collaboration. The learned features recover known descriptors in pBTTT (0-0/0-1 vibronic intensity ratio) and reveal a tail-state region correlated with polymer bleaching during successful doping. This approach delivers interpretable, noise-robust, small-data-friendly features that convert rapid measurements into reliable predictions of costly properties and readily extends to other spectral modalities (e.g., XANES, Raman, FTIR)."

Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions."

      "summary": "Microfluidic channels are integral to biomedical technology and process engineering, offering versatility in handling fluids with complex properties, often a combination of viscous and elastic attributes. Despite significant advancements in understanding small-scale fluid-structure interactions, however, experimental insights on the flow of complex fluids in deformable microchannels remain limited. Here, we present controlled experiments using polymer solutions as model viscoelastic fluids to examine the effects of polymer concentration on the elasto-mechanical characteristics of slender cylindrical microchannels. The findings indicate significant differences in fluid-structure interactions between dilute and semi-dilute polymer solutions with varying molecular weights. At higher polymer concentrations, these interactions intensify, leading to reduced pressure drops in high-shear regions and increased pressure drops in low-shear areas, linked to local wall deformation. The increased elasticity of higher concentration solutions further enhances local deformation, disrupts flow, and dissipates energy, resulting in a non-linear rise in pressure drop. This behaviour is aggravated by the solutions increased apparent viscosity due to the entangled polymer network. A theoretical model of flow-induced deformation is also developed, accounting for polymer chain extensibility. These insights highlight the importance of polymer constitution in optimizing the flow characteristics, advancing the development of adaptive microfluidic devices in biological and industrial applications for optimal performance."

      "summary": "Dense stabilized emulsions are mixtures of immiscible fluids where the high-volume fraction droplet dispersed phase is stabilized against coalescence by steric interactions. The production of emulsions involves high-shear flows and it is well known that at a critical volume fraction the emulsion loses stability, undergoing an extremely rapid process where the fluid components in the emulsion exchange roles. This process, called catastrophic phase inversion, which resembles in several respects a dynamical phase transition, has remained widely elusive from an experimental and theoretical point of view. In this work, we present state-of-the-art experimental and numerical data to support a dynamical-system framework capable of precisely highlighting the dynamics occurring in the system as it approaches the catastrophic phase inversion. Our study clearly highlights that at high volume fractions, dynamical changes in the emulsion morphology, due to coalescence and breakup of droplets, play a critical role in determining emulsion's rheology and stability. Additionally, we show that at approaching the critical volume fractions, the dynamics can be simplified as being controlled by the dynamics of a correlation length represented, in our systems, by the size of the largest droplet. This dynamics shares a close connection with non-reciprocal phase transition where two different physical mechanisms, coalescence and breakups, can get out of balance leading to large non-symmetric periodic excursions in phase space. We clarify the phenomenology observed and quantitatively explain the essential aspect of the highly complex dynamics of stabilized emulsions undergoing catastrophic phase inversion."

The microstructure is characterized by two-point statistics (covariance and spectral density) that govern finite-size fluctuations. Capillarity is modeled as a screened, modified-Helmholtz problem with phase-dependent transport under periodic boundary conditions; periodic homogenization yields an apparent conductivity, an apparent screening parameter, and a macroscopic capillary decay length. Because screening imparts a spatial low-pass response, we introduce a distribution-aware treatment of polydispersity consisting of a capillarity-weighted volume fraction and a screened analogue of the integral range that preserves variance units and recovers classical descriptors in the appropriate limits. These descriptors lead to two sizing rules: (i) a length criterion on the shortest cell edge controlled by a microstructural correlation length, the macroscopic decay length, and a high quantile of grain size; and (ii) a volume criterion that links the target coefficient of variation to the screened integral range and the phase contrast. The framework couples statistical microstructure information to capillary response and yields reproducible, distribution-aware supercell selection for image-based finite-element or fast-Fourier-transform solvers."

Here we report p-bit generation in an organic memristive device, establishing polymers as the first class of soft-matter systems to realize probabilistic hardware. The active element is a dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrole (DTP)-backbone polymer with pendant triphenylamine (TPA) groups, whose stochastic resistance fluctuations are converted into binary outputs by a simple voltage-divider/comparator circuit. The resulting probability distributions follow logistic transfer functions, characteristic of stochastic binary neurons. Separately, ensembles of pulsed IV measurements were analyzed to construct binned current distributions, from which the discrete Shannon entropy was calculated. Peaks in this entropy coincide with bias conditions that maximize variability in the memristor voltage drop, directly linking device-level stochasticity to intrinsic material properties. Dielectric analysis shows that pendant TPA units provide dynamically active relaxation modes, while energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that the frontier orbitals of DTP, TPA and ITO align within the transport gap to produce a bifurcated percolation network. The correspondence between microscopic relaxation dynamics, electronic energetics and macroscopic probabilistic response highlights how organic semiconductors can serve as chemically tunable entropy sources, opening a polymer-based pathway toward thermodynamic computing."

      "summary": "Driven by the urgent demand for efficient cooling in microelectronics and advanced thermal management systems, difluoromethane (R32/CH2F2) has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its favorable thermophysical properties, including high heat transfer efficiency and low viscosity. While bulk properties such as density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity have been widely studied, interfacial properties including surface tension and interfacial thickness remain comparatively underexplored, despite their importance in phase-transition dynamics. Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations from 180 K-300 K using an optimized transferable force field for fluoropropenes with enhanced electrostatics to assess both bulk and interfacial behavior of R32. Simulations reproduced density within +/- 2.1%, viscosity within 3.05%, and thermal conductivity within 7.41% of NIST reference data. Heat capacities (Cp and Cv) were predicted within 5%. For interfacial properties, surface tension trends were reproduced within 15.8% deviation, and the vapor-liquid coexistence curve closely matched reference data, yielding a critical temperature of 345.7 K (1.6% deviation) and a critical density of 0.397 g/cm3 (6.4% deviation). Importantly, the vapor-liquid interface exhibited strong temperature dependence, with interfacial thickness increasing by 290% between 180 K and 290 K. These validated results provide predictive molecular-level insights, particularly for interfacial properties that remain less characterized. By reducing property prediction errors in key parameters such as critical temperature, this work provides reliable inputs for heat-exchanger and system models. Beyond R32, the methodology offers a transferable framework for blended and next-generation low-GWP refrigerants, contributing to sustainable thermal management aligned with the 2027 EU F-Gas regulation and 2030 Kigali Amendment."

We find that memory effects are necessary to remove fictitious terms that would correspond to redrawing static disorder at each time step, which would create a temporally uncorrelated dynamic disorder. Our results show that while eternal memory is a necessary condition for localization, it is not sufficient. We determine that signatures of localization and transport can be found within the transfer tensors themselves by defining a metric called \"outgoing-pseudoflux\". This work establishes connections between theoretical research on dynamical maps and Markovianity and localization phenomena in physically realizable model systems."

The time-dependent characteristic length scale, extracted from the correlation function, shows a robust power law growth $\\ell(t) \\sim t^{\\alpha}$. Finite size scaling analysis across different system sizes yields $\\alpha \\approx 1.0$, establishing that coarsening is dominated by viscous hydrodynamic interactions rather than classical diffusion-limited Ostwald ripening predicted by the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory. These results provide atomistic evidence for fluid flow controlled coarsening in vapor-liquid systems and emphasize the need to go beyond diffusion-based theories to describe bubble dynamics in dense fluids."

      "summary": "The anomalous Hall effect describes the generation of a transverse voltage by a longitudinal current even in the absence of an external magnetic field. While typically observed in ferromagnets, it has also been predicted to arise in altermagnets, materials characterized by rotational symmetries that enable broken time reversal symmetry despite compensated collinear magnetic ordering. These symmetries enforce band (anti)crossings that can generate significant contributions to the Berry curvature that drives the anomalous Hall effect. This Berry curvature is predicted to exhibit a characteristic multipolar order, resulting in a symmetry-enforced distribution at or near net compensation which is highly sensitive to perturbations that distort this balance. However, exploring the predicted multipolar Berry curvature of altermagnets and its reversible manipulation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate evidence for the multipolar nature of the altermagnetic Berry curvature in MnTe by tuning the anomalous Hall effect via uniaxial stress. Upon straining, the magnitude of the anomalous Hall conductivity changes and, at a critical strain of 0.14%, the sign is reversed. Symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that this tunability is a direct consequence of the altermagnetic multipolar Berry curvature. Our results provide insight into the role of crystal and magnetic symmetries in the realization of higher-order Berry curvature distributions and their unique tunability."

      "summary": "Active control of wrinkling in soft film-substrate composites using electric fields is a critical challenge in tunable material systems. Here, we investigate the electro-mechanical instability of a soft dielectric film bonded to a hyperelastic substrate, revealing the fundamental mechanisms that enable on-demand surface patterning. For the linearized stability analysis, we use the Stroh formalism and the surface impedance method to obtain exact and sixth-order approximate bifurcation equations that signal the onset of wrinkles. We derive the explicit bifurcation equations giving the critical stretch and critical voltage for wrinkling, as well as the corresponding critical wavenumber. We look at scenarios where the voltage is kept constant and the stretch changes, and vice versa. We provide the thresholds of the shear modulus ratio $r_{\\rm c}^0$ or pre-stretch $\\lambda_{\\rm c}^0$ below which the film-substrate system wrinkles mechanically, prior to the application of a voltage. These predictions offer theoretical guidance for practical structural design, as the shear modulus ratio $r$ and/or the pre-stretch $\\lambda$ can be chosen to be slightly greater than $r_{\\rm c}^0$ and/or $\\lambda_{\\rm c}^0$, so that the film-substrate system wrinkles with a small applied voltage. Finally, we simulate the full nonlinear behavior using the Finite Element method (FEniCS) to validate our formulas and conduct a post-buckling analysis. This work advances the fundamental understanding of electro-mechanical wrinkling instabilities in soft material systems. By enabling active control of surface morphologies via applied electric fields, our findings open new avenues for adaptive technologies in soft robotics, flexible electronics, smart surfaces, and bioinspired systems."

      "summary": "We study the role of particle geometry in the ordering of bilayers of bent-core particles using a simplified two-dimensional model. Particles are confined to two parallel one-dimensional layers and can adopt only two discrete orientations of their bent cores. By mapping the system exactly onto a pair of coupled Ising chains in the thermodynamic limit, we may obtain closed-form expressions for all correlation functions. The coupling between orientational and layer degrees of freedom produces remarkably rich behaviour, including crossovers between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orientational order, and states with polarised layers. Despite its simplicity, this exactly soluble model reproduces qualitative features of bent-core smectic liquid crystals and confined colloids, providing insight into the subtle role of particle geometry in driving structural correlations."

      "summary": "Chirality in quantum materials is a topic of significant importance due to its profound effects on the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of these systems. However, it is non-trivial to decouple the behavior of two enantiomorphs within the same material -- perhaps explaining why the influence of chirality on electrical properties has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we examine the electrical conductivity, magnetoresistance, and thermal expansion coefficient of LaRhC$_{2}$ -- a compound with a chiral crystal structure (tetragonal symmetry, space groups $\\textit{P}$4$_{1}$ or $\\textit{P}$4$_{3}$). The identification of a suitable monochiral domain was achieved via electron backscatter diffraction, which simultaneously determines crystallographic orientation and handedness. Both enantiomorphs are confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction on monochiral specimens. The analysis of electrical resistivity was made possible through the single-domain extraction of enantiopure specimens from a polycrystalline sample using focused ion beam techniques. We establish that LaRhC$_{2}$ is a semiconductor with band gaps of approximately 20 meV and 33 meV parallel and perpendicular to the fourfold screw axis of the crystal structure, respectively -- consistent with band structure calculations. A significant anisotropy is also observed in the thermal expansion, electrical resistivity as well as angular-dependent magnetoresistance parallel and perpendicular o [001] crystallographic directions."

      "summary": "We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice, considering ferromagnetic interactions between first neighbors ($J_1$) and antiferromagnetic interactions between second neighbors ($J_2$). Our analysis is based on the correlated cluster mean field theory, which is adapted to incorporate competing interactions, providing estimates for the behavior of magnetization, internal energy, entropy, specific heat, and short-range correlations of the model. Our results indicate that the transition temperature of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition decreases toward zero as the frustration maximum ($J_2/J_1 = -1/4$) is approached, and the thermodynamic quantities indicate only continuous phase transitions for $-1/4<J_2/J_1 \\leq 0$. The critical temperature and the nature of phase transitions provided by the correlated cluster mean-field method are in excellent agreement with very recent Monte Carlo simulations for the model. Furthermore, the specific heat exhibits a broad maximum within the PM phase under strong frustration, suggesting the onset of a correlated paramagnetic state with high entropy content at low temperatures. Therefore, our findings support that frustration not only suppresses the ferromagnetic long-range order, but also drives significant changes in the thermodynamics and short-range correlations of the model."

      "summary": "A shift of paradigm to obtain (sub-)Kelvin environment is currently on-going with the democratization of cryogen-free cryocoolers, boosted by their easy-to-use and continuous operation without the need of liquid helium whose cost and scarcity globally increase. Thanks to their large sample space and cooling power, they can host a superconducting magnet and are an adapted platform for quantum technologies, material science, low temperature detectors and even medical fields. The drawback is that this type of system is inherently based on gas compression that induces a certain level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, which can potentially prevent the determination of low amplitude signals or spoil their stability. In this paper we demonstrate that pulse-tube based cryocoolers can be used for electrical precision measurements, using a commercial cryomagnetic system combined with our home-made a coaxial cryoprobe. In particular, parts-per-billion level of measurement uncertainties in resistance determination, based on quantum Hall resistance standards, is achievable at the level of state-of-the-art measurements involving conventional cryostats based on liquid helium. We performed an extensive characterization of the cryomagnetic system to determine the level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, and revealed that although the magnetic field has a drastic effect on the noise level, only marginal interplays on the measurement are observed as long as the working frequencies of the instrumentation are not in the vicinity of the ones of the perturbations. The set of characterization measurements presented here are easily implementable in laboratories, which can help to determine the vibrations and electromagnetic pollution generated by any cryocooler."

In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two representative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We demonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the spectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its equilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight staggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables the resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical dynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both states exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in non-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among non-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes."

      "summary": "The interaction between electron spin and molecular chirality plays a fundamental role in quantum phenomena, with significant implications for spintronics and quantum computing. The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where chiral materials preferentially transmit electrons of a particular spin, has sparked intense interest and debate regarding its underlying mechanism. Despite extensive research, the spatial distribution of spin polarization in chiral systems, the key evidence to reveal the spin scattering mechanism in CISS, has remained experimentally elusive particularly due to complications arising from spin-orbit coupling in metal electrodes typically used in such studies. Here we show, through reflective magnetic circular dichroism measurements on chiral tellurium nanowires with graphene electrodes, that current-induced spin polarization exhibits identical signs in both the nanowire and electrodes, distinct from the presumed spin filter scenario. The observed spin polarization scales linearly with current amplitude, aligns parallel to the current direction, reverses with chirality or current flow, and demonstrates spin relaxation lengths of several micrometers into graphene. Our findings provide the first direct visualization of spatial spin distribution in chiral devices. This work establishes a new paradigm for investigating spin-dependent phenomena in chiral materials and opens avenues for developing chirality-based spintronic and quantum devices."

Focusing on the case of gain and loss dissipation, we derive general conditions for the persistence of nonanalyticities (so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions) in the time evolution of the RLE. We show that nonanalyticities that are present in the corresponding unitary dynamics can survive under purely gain or purely loss processes, but are completely smeared out as soon as both channels are active, even if one is infinitesimally small. These results hold for generic dissipative Gaussian evolutions, and are illustrated explicitly for the quench from the N\\'eel state in the tight-binding chain, as well as for the quantum Ising chain. We also show that the subtle interplay between dissipative and unitary dynamics gives rise to a nested lightcone structure in the dynamics of the RLE, even in cases where this structure is not present in the corresponding unitary evolution, due to coherent cancellations in the phase structure of the wavefunction."

Introducing a moir\\'e potential by alignement with a hexagonal boron nitride substrate suppresses the superconductivity but leads instead to various fractional quantum anomalous Hall phenomena. Motivated by these observations, we consider the fate of the phase transition between (a chiral) Landau Fermi liquid (LFL) metal and a Composite Fermi Liquid (CFL) metal in the presence of attractive interactions. These are parent states, respectively, for the superconductor and the fractional quantum Hall states. For weak attractive interactions, the LFL is usually unstable to superconductivity while the CFL is stable. This raises the possibility of a direct continuous phase transition between the chiral superconductor and the CFL. However, we show that generically the LFL close to the transition to the CFL is stable against superconductivity. Thus the evolution between the CFL and chiral superconductor goes through an intermediate stable LFL phase for weak attractive interactions. With stronger interactions, the evolution can instead go through a non-Abelian paired quantum Hall state."

      "summary": "Active semiflexible filament collectives, ranging from motor-driven cytoskeletal filaments to slender organisms such as cyanobacteria and worm aggregates, abound in nature, yet how activity and flexibility jointly govern their organization, especially Isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition, remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of 3D active semiflexible polymers with varying flexibility degrees, we show that tangential active forces systematically shift the I-N transition to higher densities, with the shift controlled by the flexibility degree and activity strength. Strikingly, activity alters the nature of the transition: discontinuous at low strengths, continuous at moderate strengths, and ultimately suppressed at high activity levels. At high densities, this suppression generates an active nematic state, sustained by continuous defect creation and annihilation but lacking global order. The delayed I-N transition originates from enhanced collective bending fluctuations, which reduce the effective persistence length and enlarge the effective confinement tube. At moderate activity levels, these fluctuations trigger large-scale excitations that stochastically drive temporal transitions between nematic and isotropic states. We summarize this behavior in non-equilibrium state diagrams of density and activity for different flexibility degrees."

The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree \"y\" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in theHf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence (from 87 to 96 wt. %) of the orthorhombic phase. Therefore, the superparamagnetic response of the nanoparticles is explained by the appearance of magnetic state of oxygen vacancies accumulated near their surface. The Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, density functional theory calculations and dielectric measurements reveal that the studied ultra-small Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles may have ferroelectric-like properties and giant dielectric permittivity (> 10^3 - 10^5) in the frequency range 4 Hz - 10 kHz. In this work we observed that the static relative dielectric permittivity of the Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders overcomes 10^6 and related the colossal values with the superparaelectric states of the ultra-small cores of the nanoparticles.Thus, obtained results open the way for the creation of silicon-compatible multiferroics - oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles with the superparamagnetic and superparaelectric properties, indispensable ultra-high k nanomaterials for advanced FETs and electronic logic elements."

Beyond the primary transport processes - such as the flow of charge, heat, and spin angular momentum driven by gradients in their respective potentials - a wide range of coupled or cross-linked transport responses can occur, giving rise to a rich variety of transport phenomena. These transport phenomena are commonly categorized under (anomalous) thermoelectric, thermomagnetic, and galvanomagnetic effects, along with their spin-dependent counterparts. However, establishing a systematic classification and comparison among them remains a complex and nontrivial task. This paper attempts a didactic overview of the different transport phenomena, by categorizing and briefly discussing each of them based on charge, heat, and spin transport in conducting solids. The phenomena are structured in three categories: collinear, transverse, and so-called `planar' transport effects. The resulting overview attempts to categorize all effects in a consistent manner."

      "summary": "This paper presents a new and comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs). HBARs demonstrate several very sharp resonance modes distributed nearly periodically over a very wide frequency range. This spectrum response of HBARs offers unique advantages but poses significant modeling challenges. The proposed circuit incorporates and models the unique physical components of the HBAR: piezoelectric transducer, substrate (a perfectly periodic multimode cavity), piezoelectric coupling, and critically, the imperfectly matched transducer-substrate interface which imparts characteristic aperiodicity to the HBAR mode spectrum. By judicious use of fixed, periodic, or tightly constrained virtual lumped-element branches, and sets of branches, the model retains clear and intuitive links to the physical device, while reducing the complexity needed for fitting dense, broadband datasets. We demonstrate the validity and power of this model by simultaneously fitting measured data for 61 modes of a GaN/NbN/sapphire HBAR over a span of 1 GHz, and extracting modal parameters such as quality factors and coupling coefficients. We show that this new model is compact and yet scalable: by leveraging the inherent internal relationships in an HBAR, the model can be easily expanded to include multiple transducer overtones and envelopes, multiple distinct transducers, and spurious modes. In addition to fitting measured datasets, the new model can also be used to easily analyze various perturbations to the nominal state of the HBAR. We expect the new model to be useful for the design of classical HBAR-based oscillators, filters, and sensors, and for the integration of HBARs into quantum circuits."

In contrast, top-layer substitutions generally increase the C-O bond cleavage barrier, render the step endothermic, and result in significantly higher reverse reaction rates, making DDO unfavorable on these surfaces. This work demonstrates both the effectiveness of GRR-accelerated transition state searches for complex surface reactions and provides insights into rational design of bimetallic catalysts for selective deoxygenation."

      "summary": "Atomistic foundation models (AFMs) have great promise as accurate interatomic potentials, and have enabled data-efficient molecular dynamics simulations with near quantum mechanical accuracy. However, AFMs remain markedly slower at inference and are far more memory-intensive than conventional interatomic potentials, due to the need to capture a wide range of chemical and structural motifs in pre-training datasets requiring deep, parameter-rich model architectures. These deficiencies currently limit the practical use of AFMs in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at extended temporal and spatial scales. To address this problem, we propose a general workflow for accelerating and scaling AFMs containing message-passing architectures. We find that removing low-contribution message-passing layers from AFM backbones serves as an effective pruning method, significantly reducing the parameter count while preserving the accuracy and data-efficiency of AFMs. Once pruned, these models become more accessible for large scale simulations via a graph-partitioned, GPU-distributed strategy, which we implement and demonstrate within the AFM fine-tuning platform MatterTune. We show that this approach supports million-atom simulations on both single and multiple GPUs, and enables task-specific large-scale simulations at nanosecond timescales with AFM-level accuracy."

      "summary": "Coarsening, the process where larger structures grow at the expense of smaller ones, is a fundamental aspect of multiphase systems. The cell cytoplasm exemplifies an out-of-equilibrium multiphase system, where phase-separated condensates nucleate and expand within an active fluid made of biopolymers and energy-dependent enzymes. In this study, we explore how condensates grow in a self-stirring active fluid by examining the coarsening of biomimetic condensates embedded in a 3D reconstituted cytoskeleton composed of microtubules and molecular motors. The strong agreement among experiments, an active hydrodynamic model, and computer simulations offers a comprehensive framework that explains why self-similarity is absent in active coarsening and identifies the origins of the continuously changing coarsening exponents for both active and passive condensates. The dynamics of coarsening are primarily determined by the statistics of binary droplet collisions, which depend on their size-dependent motility, regardless of whether they are active or passive. These results reveal a unifying control parameter for the coarsening process and size distribution of active condensates, broadening our understanding of phase separation in out-of-equilibrium systems and potentially impacting materials science and biology."

Relatively few examples are known where wavefunctions can be directly written down in the spin basis. In this article, we consider the spin-$S$ Kitaev model in one dimension. For $S=1/2$, its eigenstates can be written using a Jordan-Wigner fermionic representation. Here, we present ground state wavefunctions for any $S$ directly in the spin basis. The states we propose are valence bond arrangements, with bonds having singlet or triplet character for $S=1/2$. For $S>1/2$, we use bond-states that serve as analogues of singlets and triplets. We establish the validity of our wavefunctions using a perturbative approach starting from an anisotropic limit, with key features surviving to all orders in perturbation theory. For half-integer $S$ and periodic boundaries, we have exponential ground state degeneracy. The ground states have topological character, with an even number of `triplets' superposed on a background of `singlets'. For integer $S$, a unique ground state emerges, composed purely of `triplets'. Our spin-basis wavefunctions, while not exact, capture the dominant weight of the ground state(s). We obtain good agreement against exact diagonalization wavefunctions and Jordan-Wigner spectra."

      "summary": "Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-term atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance."

Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials."

Particularly noteworthy is graphene grown on single-crystalline Cu(111)/sapphire substrates, which exhibits exceptionally planar oriented stitching due to the atomically smooth substrate, facilitating the formation of continuous, high-quality graphene monolayer. These single-orientation stitches have conventionally been regarded as seamless with negligible defect concentrations. In this report, we present experimental observations regarding graphene grown on single-crystalline Cu(111)/sapphire substrates. Among the graphene flakes with single-orientation, our findings reveal two major merging behaviors: one producing the expected seamless stitching, and another unexpectedly generating structural defects that create nanoscale pathways permitting water permeation. Notably, we identify a unique merging structure--overlapped junction, in which the edge of one graphene flake overlaps and lies atop the edge of another flake, rather than forming a continuous atomic stitch. This discovery challenges the conventional anticipation of single-orientation stitched graphene films as seamless single crystalline film, while offers unique perspective for graphene applications in molecular sieving, selective filtration membranes, and protective coatings."

Equilibrium vacancy concentrations in MPEAs influence diffusion and microstructural stability in these alloys. However, computing vacancy concentrations from ab-initio methods is computationally challenging due to the vast compositional space of MPEAs and the complexity of the local environment around each vacancy. In this work, we present an efficient approach to connect electronic structure calculations to equilibrium vacancy concentrations in MPEAs through embedded cluster expansions (eCE) and rigorous statistical mechanics methods. Using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations informed by eCE, we assess the variation in vacancy formation with alloy composition and temperature. Our method is demonstrated on a nine-component MPEA comprised of elements in groups 4, 5, and 6 of the periodic table. Correlations between alloy chemistry, short-range order, and equilibrium vacancy concentrations in alloys containing up to 9 different elements are analyzed. The vacancy concentration of refractory alloys increases with the addition of group 4 elements or elements whose mixing is energetically unfavorable. The insights into vacancy behavior and the efficient computational framework presented in this study serve as a guide for the design of complex concentrated alloys with controlled vacancy concentrations."

Extending their detection capabilities into the far infrared range (>10 um) requires careful selection of substrate materials and detector geometries. The overall detection efficiency is linked to absorption and coupling efficiencies. In this study, the resonator geometry and absorption efficiency were estimated using electromagnetic simulations in CST Microwave Studio for a lumped-element meander structure. Simulations were performed for the 12 to 50 um wavelength range, corresponding to the Infrared Free Electron Laser (IR FEL) at RRCAT, Indore. Absorption in the meander inductor was influenced by the substrate material, thickness, and impedance matching between the detector and incident photon medium. The results indicate that SiO2 and diamond substrates are suitable for developing lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKID) in this range. Optimized meander geometries on diamond substrates demonstrated absorption efficiencies of up to 95% for narrow bandwidths and over 50% for wide bandwidths. A 30-pixel LEKID structure was fabricated using electron beam lithography on a 500 um SiO2 coated Si substrate, with a 20 nm thick Ti40V60 alloy resonator. Experimental absorption efficiency was determined through transmission and reflection measurements. Results show that in the 14 to 26 um IR-FEL range, the LEKID achieved up to 75% absorption efficiency. These studies demonstrate that the LEKID structure is ideal for detecting far infrared wavelengths above 10 um, with high absorption efficiency."

This ab initio approach allows us to elucidate the character of magnetic Frenkel excitons in CrI3 and how the nonmagnetic Wannier-Mott excitons in WSe2 are modified by the proximity of CrI3. We reveal novel proximity-induced interlayer excitons in these heterostructures. In contrast to the sensitivity of proximity-induced modifications of excitons in WSe$_2$, which depend on the interfacial details, the interlayer magnetic excitons are remarkably robust and are present across the different stacking configurations between WSe$_2$ and CrI$_3$, simplifying their experimental demonstration. These findings suggest unexplored opportunities for information transduction using magnetic excitons and integrating photonics, electronics, and spintronics in proximitized materials."

Lett. 135, 046705 (2025)], based on a linearized density-matrix master equation with quantum treatment of electron scattering processes. In this work, we extend the method to include the drift term due to an electric field along a periodic direction, implemented efficiently using a Wannier-representation-based covariant derivative. We employ this approach to investigate the electric-field effect on l_{s} of monolayer WSe_{2}, bulk GaAs, bulk GaN, and graphene-h-BN heterostructure. Our results show that l_{s} can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by a moderate downstream or upstream field respectively. Although the widely-used drift-diffusion model performs well for WSe_{2} and GaAs, it can introduce large errors of the electric-field-induced changes of l_{s} in both GaN and graphene-h-BN. Thus, to accurately capture the influence of electric fields on l_{s} in realistic materials, it is necessary to go beyond the drift-diffusion model and adopt a microscopic \\textit{ab initio} methodology. Moreover, in graphene-h-BN, we find that the field-induced change of l_{s} is not only governed by the drift term in the master equation, but is also significantly affected by the electric-field modification of the equilibrium density matrix away from Fermi-Dirac distribution function."

In this work, Bi2Te2.6Se0.4 synthesized by melting-hot pressing followed by 100 h annealing (MT-HP-AN) at 723 K exhibits markedly improved performance. Annealing introduces cation vacancies via Te(Se) volatilization, lowering carrier density and enhancing mobility, while simultaneously increasing phonon scattering. A peak ZT of 1.06 at 373 K and an average ZT of 0.99 at 300-423 K are achieved. This MT-HP-AN approach offers a simple yet effective strategy to decouple carrier and phonon transport, advancing the potential of n-type BTS for thermo-electric cooling applications."

      "summary": "We propose a decomposition of information flow into housekeeping and excess components for autonomous bipartite systems subject to Markov jump processes. We introduce this decomposition by using the geometric structure of probability currents and the conjugate thermodynamic forces. The housekeeping component arises from the cyclic modes caused by the detailed balance violations and maintains the correlations between the two subsystems. In contrast, the excess component, is a contribution of conservative forces that alters the mutual information between the two subsystems. With this decomposition, we generalize previous results, such as the second law of information thermodynamics, the cyclic decomposition, and the information-thermodynamic extensions of thermodynamic trade-off relations."

The focus of this study is to develop a fast EAM potential for the interactions among the three elements (W, H, and He), fitted to accurately reproduce both the ab initio formation energies and relaxation volumes of small defect clusters containing light gases within tungsten. The potential enables the study of tungsten under irradiation and in the presence of light gases. To demonstrate the utility of the potential, we construct a thermodynamically motivated model for predicting the energetics of light-gas-filled voids. The model is then validated through molecular dynamics simulations with our new potential."

This process provides a natural setting to evaluate the predictive power of generic statistical closure schemes for dynamical correlation functions, in the fully non-linear and non-perturbative regime. We develop a numerical scheme that explicitly implements the seminal \"Martin-Siggia-Rose\" formalism at one-loop order via an iterative fixed-point approach, thereby improving upon the bare order from the \"Direct Interaction Approximation.\" Using this framework, we quantitatively validate the ability of the formalism to predict (i) the two-point two-time correlation function; (ii) the renormalised three-point interaction vertex; (iii) the three-point three-time correlation function. These predictions are compared to direct measurements from numerical simulations. We conclude by discussing the limitations of this approach and presenting possible future venues."

      "summary": "The nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a powerful tool to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated lattice systems, but its applicability to realistic system sizes and long timescales is limited by unfavorable memory scaling. While compressed representations, such as the recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) format, alleviate the memory bottleneck, the efficiency of QTT-NEGF calculations is hindered by poor initializations and slow or unstable convergence of globally updated self-consistent iterations. Here, we introduce a predictor-corrector solver for QTT-NEGF simulations that combines dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) extrapolation with the recently proposed causality-preserving block-time-stepping updates. The DMD predictor supplies accurate initial guesses that reduce the iteration count of the calculation, while the block-time-stepping correction ensures stable convergence even for long propagation intervals. Applying this method to the Hubbard model on a $32\\times 32$ lattice within the nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation, we demonstrate stable propagation up to times of $t_\\mathrm{max}=512$ inverse hoppings, surpassing the capabilities of both matrix-based implementations and previous QTT solvers. Our contribution is twofold. (i) We integrate tensor dynamic mode decomposition with the QTT representation, which establishes a general framework that is not limited to NEGFs. (ii) We demonstrate its practical benefits in NEGF simulations, where it enables stable and efficient access to unprecedented timescales at high momentum resolution, thereby advancing controlled studies of long-time dynamics and nonequilibrium steady states in correlated lattice systems."

      "summary": "Radiation damage in structural materials is a major challenge for advanced nuclear energy systems, and niobium is of particular interest due to its high melting point, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance. To better understand its radiation response, we carried out large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of collision cascades in pure niobium at 300 K over a primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy range of 1-75 keV, employing four interatomic potentials: an embedded atom method (EAM), two Finnis-Sinclair models (FS-1 and FS-2), and a machine learning-based spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) we developed. All reproduce the general features of cascade formation but differ significantly in defect production, clustering, and morphology. At low energies, defect generation follows trends governed by threshold displacement energy (TDE) and the stiffness-to-range ratio (|S/R|). At higher energies, subcascade formation makes defect evolution dependent on the combined effects of |S/R|, average TDE, and other material-specific factors. Vacancy clustering dominates over interstitial clustering across all cases: EAM produces the largest vacancy clusters and the highest clustering fraction, while SNAP shows the strongest interstitial clustering. Morphological analysis indicates that EAM forms a balanced mix of 1/2 , 1/2 loops, C15 rings, and hybrid structures; FS-2 favors extended 1/2 dumbbells, crowdions, and dislocation loops; whereas FS-1 and SNAP generate more compact or disordered clusters, with SNAP produces a high fraction of C15-like rings (maximum size up to nine atoms) that may evolve into dislocation loops of 1/2 and . These findings give clear insights into how niobium reacts when exposed to irradiation, especially at high energies."

However, challenges such as limited scalability, low-temperature operation, and the lack of robust electronic transport have hindered practical implementations. Here, we demonstrate the QSHE in an InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum well structure operating at elevated temperatures. This platform meets key criteria for device integration, including scalability, reproducibility, and tunability via electric field. When the Fermi level is positioned within the energy gap, we observe quantized resistance values independent of device length and in both local and nonlocal measurement configurations, confirming the QSHE. Helical edge transport remains stable up to T = 60 K, with further potential for higher-temperature operation. Our findings establish the InAs/GaInSb system as a promising candidate for integration into next-generation devices harnessing topological functionalities, advancing the development of topological electronics."

These results allow us to characterize the nature of the ordered phases of the model.

We also analyze the behavior along the phase boundaries. In particular, we characterize the universal crossover behavior across the K-KI phase boundary. On this boundary, the dynamic critical exponent is $z=4$, i.e., $\\Delta \\sim L^{-4}$ for large values of $L$."

The thin films were grown using a two-step procedure: deposition of LaxMnO3-{\\delta} and potassium K+ incorporation into the films via isopiestic annealing. The temperature behavior of the MCD effect in different spectral regions was analyzed alongside the temperature dependences of magnetization, resistivity, and magnetoresistance of the films. It was found that the MCD signal is sensitive not only to the magnetic but also to the charge sublattice of the material. Accordingly, a correlation between the magneto-optical and magnetoresistive responses of the system was identified. These findings underscore the high information content of MCD spectroscopy for investigating the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of strongly correlated magnetic oxides. The ground and excited electronic states in the La1-xKxMnO3 films were identified, and the obtained data were compared with magneto-optical data for divalent - doped and lanthanum-deficient manganite films. Good agreement was observed, indicating the universality of the electronic structure and the shared mechanisms underlying the observed effects in such materials. These results broaden the understanding of the band structure in manganites and provide a solid foundation for its theoretical description."

We obtain the velocity as a function of current by a perturbation method for low velocities, and the wall profile is found to lack a definite parity. For high velocities, the main features of the wall profile are obtained by a direct solution of an equation that is valid in a limiting case. We discuss the magnetization of the dynamical walls and find that this can become large, providing a potential method for observations. Oscillatory motion of domain walls is obtained for spin polarization that has both perpendicular and in-plane components, and an analytical description is given."

      "summary": "In isotropic fluids like water, micrometer-scale swimmers have evolved swim strokes to translate despite their tiny size. As described by Purcell in his Scallop Theorem, reciprocal motions, like those performed by a scallop, cannot drive swimming when inertial effects are absent, as is typical at micrometer length scales. Thus, microswimmers have evolved complex structures that can perform non-reciprocal swim strokes or body displacements to generate motion. Microswimmer dynamics in structured fluids differ fundamentally from those in isotropic fluids because of their inherent asymmetry. The orientation of elongated constituents and the topological defects that spontaneously form near microswimmers provide broken symmetries, even atequilibrium. This is sufficient for the dynamic disturbance of even the simplest isotropic swimmers to generate propulsion. We combine experiments on magnetically rotated colloids in nematic liquid crystals with analytic non-equilibrium solutions to formulate propulsion strategies for microswimmers in nematic fluids and determine how swimming velocity depends on the rotation rate, materials parameters, and forcing regimes. For example, we find that micro-scale spherical colloids swim effectively under continuous rotation and under reciprocal forcing.Thus, swim strokes that are ineffective in isotropic fluids are highly effective in nematic liquid crystals. In light of these observations, the Scallop Theorem is extended for structured fluids."

      "summary": "An effective continuum theory is constructed for the topological phase transition of excitons in quasi-two-dimensional systems. These topological excitons crucially determine the optoelectronic properties, because of their larger binding energies in 2D as well as their topologically enhanced exciton transport. The core idea of this letter is, that the essential physics determining the topological invariants across the phase transition is localized near $N$-fold band-crossing points (BCPs) in the interaction-induced exciton band structure. The construction of the continuum theory around these BCPs needs only the information of exciton states that build up these BCPs at both $\\mathbf{Q}=0$ and finite $\\mathbf{Q}$ points, and not the numerically challenging solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation over the full exciton Brillouin zone. This theory applies to systems with and without spin conservation. Our theory is illustrated in two specific examples: the transition metal dichalcogenide twisted bilayer systems and the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. These results offer a promising route toward studying complex systems, such as the room-temperature quantum spin Hall system Bismuthene (Bi/SiC) and other twisted bilayer systems."

      "summary": "The growth of high-quality magnetic topological insulator crystals by the Bridgman method remains challenging due to thermodynamic limitations inherent to this technique. Nevertheless, this approach continues to provide bulk materials with significantly reduced free carrier concentrations compared to epitaxial methods. Here, we investigate the Inverted Vertical Bridgman growth of MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n crystals, with particular emphasis on the structural ordering of MnBi2Te4 septuple layers within the Bi2Te3 quintuple-layer matrix and its influence on magnetic properties. Through a detailed analysis of growth dynamics, we identify four distinct stages, including a turbulent flow regime promoting pure MnBi2Te4 phase, rapid MnTe precipitation reducing Mn content in the melt, a stationary growth phase supporting ordered stacking of septuple and quintuple layers, and a final stage marked by flow cessation and defect formation. We demonstrate that septuple layer spacing is inversely correlated with MnTe supersaturation due to the diffusion-limited incorporation in stationary growth phase. Magnetic characterization reveals antiferromagnetic ordering in pure MnBi2Te4 phase and in MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n heterostructure, with ferromagnetism emerging for wider septuple layer spacing. We determine critical temperatures for observed antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phase transitions and magnetic anisotropy constants for ferromagnetic samples. Our findings highlight key growth parameters governing magnetic and structural quality, offering a pathway to scalable synthesis of layered topological insulators with tunable magnetic properties."

Using models in the BDI class, which include the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, we show that breaking mirror symmetries that anticommute with the chiral operator leads to edge-selective bulk-boundary correspondence, with gap closings and bound states appearing only along a subset of boundaries of the same orientation. We define a new edge-sensitive topological invariant, distinguishing this mechanism from previous reports of non-topological edge-selection effects."

      "summary": "The interaction of electromagnetic waves with dielectric Janus particles gives rise to radiation forces and torques, governed by the dielectric properties, interface orientation, and the size-to-wavelength ratio. In this study, we employ the Lattice Boltzmann Method to compute the radiation-induced drag, lift, and torque on circular Janus cylinders when illuminated by a transverse magnetic polarized plane wave. We analyze both metallo-dielectric and dielectric Janus cylinders. For metallo-dielectric Janus cylinders, LBM predictions are validated against analytical results, showing excellent agreement in far-field bistatic scattering width, radiation force, and torque across a range of dielectric constants and interface orientations. Extending the study to dielectric Janus cylinders, we explore how the dielectric contrast and interface orientation shape the optomechanical response. Our findings show that radiation-induced forces and torques can be harnessed to drive and control the motion of dielectric Janus particles in optofluidic, active, and self-assembling systems."

      "summary": "We report a dynamical phase transition in the information spreading within a classical 2D deterministic interacting many-body system. Specifically, the transition is observed in a recently introduced momentum-conserving parity check cellular automaton (MCPCA) on the square lattice. We characterize the transition using information-theoretic quantities such as the Hamming distance and the classical decorrelator. By introducing conserved local charges of the MCPCA, we show that selecting initial ensembles with specific charge values allows the system to transition from a localized information phase to a chaotic regime with ballistic information spreading. Importantly, our findings indicate that this transition is of second order, highlighting a sharp change in information spreading behavior. Furthermore, we revisit the multifractal behavior of the dynamical structure factor and show that, although present across both phases, it originates from effective local periodicities enforced by symmetry constraints."

      "summary": "Aligning theoretical atomistic structural models of materials with available experimental data presents a significant challenge for disordered systems. The configurational space to navigate is vast, and faithful realizations require large system sizes with quantum-mechanical accuracy in order to capture the distribution of structural motifs present in experiment. Traditional equilibrium sampling approaches offer no guarantee of generating structures that coincide with experimental data for such systems. An efficient means to search for such structures is molecular augmented dynamics (MAD) [arXiv:2508.17132], a modified molecular dynamics method that can generate ab-initio accurate, low-energy structures through a multi-objective optimization of the interatomic potential energy and the experimental potential. The computational scaling of this method depends on both the scaling of the interatomic potential and that of the experimental potential. We present the general equations for MAD with linear-scaling formulations for calculating and matching X-ray/neutron diffraction and local observables, e.g., the core-electron binding energies used in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. MAD simulations can both find metastable structures compatible with non-equilibrium experimental synthesis and lower energy structures than alternative computational sampling protocols, like the melt-quench approach. In addition, generalizing the virial tensor with the experimental forces enables generalized barostatting, allowing one to find structures whose density matches that compatible with the experimental observables. Scaling tests with the TurboGAP code demonstrate their linear-scaling nature for both CPU and GPU implementations, the latter of which has a 100$\\times$ speedup compared to the CPU."

      "summary": "Strong coupling (SC) is a fundamental concept in physics that describes extreme interactions between light and matter. Recent experiments have demonstrated SC at the nanometer scale, where strongly confined polaritons, rather than photons, couple to quantum emitters or molecular vibrations. Coupling with the latter is generally referred to as vibrational SC (VSC) and is of significant fundamental and technological interest, as it can be an effective tool for modifying molecular properties. However, the implementation of VSC, especially at the nanoscale, depends on the development of tuning mechanisms that allow control over the coupling strength and, eventually, its directionality, opening the door for the selective coupling of specific molecular vibrations. Here we report the observation of directional VSC. Specifically, we show nanoscale images of propagating hyperbolic phonon polaritons (PhPs) coupled to pentacene molecules revealing that the fingerprint of VSC for propagating polaritons -- a marked anti-crossing in their dispersion at the vibrational resonance -- can be modulated as a function of the direction of propagation. In addition, we show that VSC can exhibit an optimal condition for thin molecular layers, characterized by a maximum coupling strength along one single direction. This phenomenon is understood by analysing the overlap of the polariton field with molecular layers of varying thicknesses. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings promise novel applications for directional sensing or local directional control of chemical properties at the nanoscale."

PCM-based IMC is also poised to play a pivotal role in cryogenic applications, including quantum computing and deep space electronics. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of PCM devices across temperatures down to 5 K, covering the range most relevant to these domains. We systematically investigate key physical mechanisms such as phase transitions and threshold switching that govern device programming at low temperatures.

      "summary": "The information-geometric origin of fidelity susceptibility and its utility as a universal probe of quantum criticality in many-body settings have been widely discussed. Here we explore the metric response of quantum relative entropy (QRE), by tracing out all but $n$ adjacent sites from the ground state of spin chains of finite length $N$, as a parameter of the corresponding Hamiltonian is varied. The diagonal component of this metric defines a susceptibility of the QRE that diverges at quantum critical points (QCPs) in the thermodynamic limit. We study two spin-$1/2$ models as examples, namely the integrable transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and a non-integrable Ising chain with three-spin interactions. We demonstrate distinct scaling behaviors for the peak of the QRE susceptibility as a function of $N$: namely a square logarithmic divergence in TFIM and a power-law divergence in the non-integrable chain. This susceptibility encodes uncertainty of entanglement Hamiltonian gradients and is also directly connected to other information measures such as Petz-R\\'enyi entropies. We further show that this susceptibility diverges even at finite $N$ if the subsystem size, $n$, exceeds a certain value when the Hamiltonian is tuned to its classical limits due to the rank of the RDMs being finite; unlike the divergence associated with the QCPs which require $N \\rightarrow \\infty$."

      "summary": "Field induced assembly of reconfigurable structures with complex hierarchical configurations has recently become an area of intense research with the promise for exciting applications in programmable self-assembly and nano/microstructure fabrication. While a wide variety of structures, from crystals to glasses, to chains and oligomers have been produced by activating colloidal particles with electric and magnetic fields, a combined approach utilizing the capabilities of multiple field types offers a richer parameter space, enabling precise structural control and a higher degree of reconfigurability. Here we demonstrate the assembly of complex hierarchical colloidal superstructures using an electric field (AC) and magnetic field (DC) combination. In our chosen frequency regime, dipolar (magnetic and electric) and electrohydrodynamic interactions are comparable, leading to a rich phase space with a wide number of configurations which are tunable by relatively small changes of the field parameters. This is in contrast to the existing small number of studies on multi-field induced assembly that work in size and frequency regimes where the dominant mechanism is dipolar interaction induced assembly. We show that depending upon the direction and frequency of the applied fields, there can be three possibilities in structure formation: a) a cooperation among the fields b) a competition among the fields and c) hierarchical reorganization in which micrometer-sized particles form chains that are part of larger clusters or 'domains' spanning tens of micrometers. This versatile, easy to set up and fully reconfigurable approach of multi-field induced structure formation opens up new opportunities for bottom-up fabrication of smart materials, switchable photonic crystals, and modular microswimmers for targeted drug delivery and environmental remediation."

Avoiding these defects by improvements in design, fabrication and materials proved to be a significant challenge that so far led to limited progress. The merged-element transmon qubit (''mergemon''), a recently proposed paradigm shift in transmon design, attempts to address these issues by engineering the Josephson junction to act as its own shunt capacitor. With its energy mostly confined within the junctions, efforts required to improve qubit coherence can be concentrated on the junction barrier, a potentially easier to control interface compared to exposed circuit areas. Incorporating an additional aluminium deposition and oxidation into the in-situ bandaged Niemeyer-Dolan technique, we were able to fabricate flux-tunable mergemon qubits achieving mean $T_{1}$ relaxation times of up to $130\\mu s$ ($Q \\approx 3.3 \\times 10^{6}$). TLS spectroscopy under applied strain and electric fields, together with systematic design variations, revealed that even for mergemon qubits - despite their significantly reduced footprint and increased junction barrier volume - careful design considerations are still essential to avoid coherence limitations due to surface loss."

      "summary": "Quantum gases are used to simulate the physics of the lowest Landau level (LLL) with neutral atoms, which in the simplest setup is achieved by rotating the gas at the confining harmonic trap frequency, a requirement that is difficult to achieve in practice. We point out that for weakly interacting Fermi gases, this rapid-rotation limit is not needed to access the LLL: As a direct consequence of first-order perturbation theory, many-body wave functions of states in the LLL remain unchanged at any rotation, and only their energies shift. This implies that even in the absence of rotations or for moderate rotations frequencies, LLL states are present as excited states at finite angular momentum. For fermions with contact interactions, these states are exact eigenstates of a paradigmatic model of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states described by a single Haldane pseudopotential ($V_1$ for spin-polarized and $V_0$ for spinful systems), which realizes exact Laughlin and Haldane wave functions. We suggest that recently developed excitation and imaging techniques for rotating few-fermion systems allow for a detailed experimental investigation of FQH wave functions and to study the crossover to large particle number. We illustrate this for $N = 6$ spin-balanced fermions"

The origin of time-reversal symmetry breaking has been of particular interest, and conflicting results have been intensely debated. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provided crucial evidence by the observation that apparent chirality associated with the 2 $\\times$ 2 charge density wave (CDW) may be modified by the direction of magnetic field, a phenomenon observed in select sample areas in some experiments, but not others. Related to this, Xing et al. investigated the effects of magnetic and electric fields on the 2 $\\times$ 2 CDW state and the lattice structure of kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. They report a $\\sim$ 1% change in the in-plane lattice constants, concomitant with the CDW intensities modification, controlled by the field direction. This was interpreted as a rare case of piezomagnetism. Here we show how the apparent magnetic field induced lattice and CDW intensity change is a consequence of two independent experimental artifacts: reconfiguration of atoms at the STM tip apex that alter the amplitudes of CDW modulations, and piezo creep, hysteresis, and thermal drift that artificially distort STM topographs. We find no evidence supporting that magnetic field leads to intrinsic changes in the sample, which challenges reported piezomagnetism."

Because these networks are strongly driven by inputs, however, they do not operate at a true critical point but within a quasi-critical regime -- one that still approximately satisfies crackling noise scaling relations. By training networks with different initializations, we show that maximal susceptibility is a more reliable predictor of learning than proximity to the critical point itself. This provides a blueprint for engineering improved network performance. Finally, using finite-size scaling we identify distinct universality classes, including Barkhausen noise and directed percolation. This theoretical framework demonstrates that universal features are shared by both biological and artificial neural networks."

The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition."

We use the conditional mutual information to check the goodness of Petz recovery, analytically in a random-matrix-theory-inspired hopping model and numerically in an Ising-like spin chain model. We observe different behavior in chaotic versus integrable phases of the model: in the chaotic phase, the reconstruction works well at both very low and very high temperatures, with some intermediate critical temperature at which reconstruction works worst, whereas in the integrable phase reconstruction breaks down at low temperatures."

It enables one to sample from thermal and ground states of local Hamiltonians of various spin, bosonic and fermionic systems as long as the Hamiltonian does not have a negative-sign problem. Despite the practical success of this method, theoretical understanding of the efficiency of the algorithm has been lacking. The operator-loop update is commonly used for path-integral formulation (Suzuki-Trotter/world-lines) of the partition function. In this work we consider this method applied to the stoquastic (sign-problem free) XY model and prove that the mixing time of the Markov chain is polynomial in the system size and the inverse temperature. Using the fast mixing Markov chain, we can estimate the partition functions of the Hamiltonians that we consider in a polynomial time, significantly improving upon the best known previous algorithm by Bravyi and Gosset [arXiv:1612.05602]. Our algorithm also allows for natural extensions to a wide class of empirically fast-mixing Hamiltonians."

This model can be seen as a conservative counterpart to the spatially extended FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Lacking a gradient structure, the BM model was observed to exhibit interesting dynamics including traveling periodic wave-trains and other coherent structures, as well as spatiotemporal chaos in certain parameter regimes. In this paper, we derive an effective equation for the interface dynamics of solutions to the BM model in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in the sharp-interface limit. The resulting system of equations is a generalization of the classical Mullins-Sekerka (MS) equations, which we refer to as the modified MS equations. We show that the modified MS equation shares some properties with its classical counterpart, but importantly, it is not in general a length minimizing flow. To illustrate the utility of this asymptotic reduction in the sharp interface limit, we perform a detailed analysis of stationary and periodic wave-trains, systematically deriving expressions for wave-train speeds and stability thresholds. The methods used here should be applicable to other non-reciprocally coupled CH models and therefore provide another avenue for their more detailed analysis."

Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear) remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with optimization by gradient-based algorithms."

However, incorporating magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), a key feature of real magnets, remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a quantum simulation framework for MCA in CuSb2O6, a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with alternating ferromagnetic chains arising from frustrated, anisotropic exchange interactions in a nearly square lattice. The $\\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ spin network is modeled as a four-qubit square lattice, with four paired ancilla qubits introduced to encode angle-dependent MCA. This two-qubit representation per spin site resolves the limitation that squared Pauli operators yield only the identity, enabling MCA terms to be faithfully embedded into quantum circuits. Using the variational quantum eigensolver, we determine an exceptionally small easy-axis MCA constant, just 0.00022% of the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, yet sufficient to drive a spin-flop transition with $90^{\\circ}$ spin reorientation and strong angular variation in magnetic torque. Beyond this regime, the simulations uncover a half-saturated magnetic phase at ultra-high fields, stabilized by anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of resource-efficient quantum simulations of complex magnetic phenomena in real materials."

The formation of voids and cracks has been observed at temperatures above 600C, leading to the formation of dust or oxide spalling, which could be problematic in maintenance and waste-handling scenarios of a fusion power plant. Preferential oxidation taking place at the edge of the specimen was characterised, and its impact is discussed in relation to component design. Characterisation using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the oxide scale is formed of three main layers: the inner layer is 30-50 nm thick WO2 oxide, the middle layer is a 10-20 um of WO_2.72 and the outer layer is formed of WO2.9/WO3 phases - whose thickness varies according to the total thickness of the oxide scale.

We apply it to experimental data from a semiconductor spin-qubit device and obtain noise spectra over five orders of magnitude in frequency (5 mHz--500 Hz). Compared to other techniques, SSCS enables access to noise correlations in the previously inaccessible intermediate-frequency range (1--500 Hz) for spin qubits, and can be further extended with faster readout.

Having each atom of the pair prepared in a matter waveguide, the scheme can be scaled to hundreds of parallel entanglement sources in an array connected to a matter wave optical network of beam splitters, phase shifters, interferometers, tunnel junctions and local detectors. The protocol builds on established techniques, including programmable optical potentials, high-fidelity single-particle control, single-molecule initialization, controlled molecular dissociation, and quantum gas microscopy with near-perfect detection, making it directly implementable with current technology.

Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics."

      "summary": "We demonstrate a general protocol for realizing fast high-fidelity multi-qubit gates, through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to a central qubit coupled to target qubits. This way, we are able to control the states of the target qubits by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow error-prone direct control. The DD-gate protocol is developed and experimentally implemented within two distinct frameworks: a hardware-agnostic model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked within a general-purpose digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Likewise, we are able to thoroughly characterize the quantum mechanical dynamics behind the multi-qubit gates within IBMQ, without many of the experimental constraints faced by other quantum systems. While at the same time, we establish the protocol for the $^{15}$NV system, considering its specific properties. The DD-gates with $^{15}$NVs can represent a significant reduction in gate times and improved technological scalability, compared to current methods of target qubit control using dynamical decoupling. In addition, we propose a simple application of the method for high-efficiency polarization generation of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin. All experimental findings are supported by comprehensive open-source simulations in the two distinct frameworks. This work provides a robust hardware-agnostic strategy for quantum control, which can be implemented with arbitrary systems that fit the central-target qubits description. Thus, marking an essential step in technological scalability of future quantum devices."

      "summary": "The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial \"preheating\" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct \"cooling\" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity."

The model accounts for major friction losses between junctions and incorporates wall slip through a power-law relation calibrated independently via capillary rheometry. Predictions from the model are validated against both bench-scale experiments and fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, showing excellent agreement across a range of flow conditions. Our results demonstrate that wall slip strongly influences the uniformity of fluid distribution by modifying the relative resistance between outlet branches. Furthermore, we show that the problem can be inverted: measured distribution profiles can be used to estimate slip parameters, offering a practical method for slip characterisation without pressure measurement. This modelling framework is computationally inexpensive, robust, and adaptable to various network configurations, making it a valuable tool for the design and analysis of industrial manifold systems involving viscoplastic fluids."

By adopting the modern formalism of uniform hyperbolicity, we are able to strengthen and rigorously prove a Saxon-Hutner-type result, fully characterising the spectral gaps of the composite bi-infinite aperiodic system in terms of its constituent blocks. Crucial to this approach is a change of basis from transfer matrices to propagation matrices, allowing for a block-level characterisation. This approach also enables an explicit characterisation of edge-induced eigenmodes in the semi-infinite setting. Finally, we leverage finite section methods for Jacobi operators to extend our results to finite systems - providing strict bounds for their spectra in terms of their constituent blocks."

Similar to the original Hamiltonian model introduced by Fendley, these circuits are defined by the fact that the Floquet operator corresponding to a single time step can not be diagonalized by means of any Jordan-Wigner transformation, but still displays a free-fermionic spectrum. Our construction makes use of suitable non-local transfer matrices commuting with the Floquet operator, allowing us to establish the free fermionic spectrum. We also study the dynamics of these circuits after they are initialized in arbitrary product states, proving that the evolution of certain local observables can be simulated efficiently on classical computers. Our work proves recent conjectures in the literature and raises new questions on the classical simulability of free fermions in disguise."

A single atom produces an interference pattern consisting of concentric fringes of finite diameter and of very weak intensity. The diffraction angle theta, determined as the first minimum of the concentric rings interference pattern, exhibits similar dependency on the source-to-sample distance zs as sin(theta) ~ 0.3/sqrt(zs) for electrons of different energies (50, 100 and 200 eV) and scattered off different elements (Li, C, and Cs).

For instance, frustration in the kagome lattice suppresses long range spin correlations and it is expected to be a candidate for a spin liquid system. Therefore, with the advent of experiments with ultra-cold atoms, the interest for frustrated geometries has increased. Given this, in the present work we investigate the repulsive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We examine its thermodynamic properties, as well as the magnetic and transport response of the system at finite temperatures and different values of the repulsive interaction. From these results, we discuss the possible occurrence of adiabatic cooling, a quite important feature in ultra-cold systems, and the presence of a metal-to-insulator transition at a finite interaction strength. Our findings may guide future experiments in ultra-cold fermionic atoms on the kagome lattice."

(i) Motivated by the recent experiment [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019)] which focused on the lower-energy dynamic behaviors of the dBH chain, we first show that, at low energies, for a thermalizing state, although the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the decrease of the total entropy over time, for part of the channel-resolved entropies, a long-term entropic reduction may arise at weak disorder. (ii) A companion channel-resolved analysis at strong disorder further hints that the priorly observed double-log growth of the number entropy might not directly indicate the breakdown of MBL in spin or fermion chains, providing a refreshing perspective on this major controversy in the community. (iii) From time-evolving the line-shape low-energy product state, we subsequently reveal an abrupt formation of a novel \"entropy imbalance pattern\" across the different symmetry channels. Intriguingly, this imbalance melts in the strong-disorder limit. We conjecture that the melting of the entropic pattern, together with the freezing of a concurrent particle-density wave, embodies a dual trait inherent to MBL. (iv) Specifically, we find a cluster MBL regime, unique to the Bose statistics, emerging from the higher-energy section. This cluster MBL regime realizable even at weak disorder appears not suffer from the finite-size drift and is distinguished by its absence of the hallmark of MBL - the unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy. Our theoretical predictions are by and large testable via the present experimental facilities."

Our calculations for systems up to eight layers give rise to electron-hole asymmetries, band flatness, band gaps, and layer anti-ferromagnetic ground states in keeping with available experiments. By including the intersite Hubbard interactions up to the next-nearest neighboring sites, the band gaps are shown to open when the number of layers is larger than three, while the trilayer system maintains its metallic nature with two low energy density of state peaks near the Fermi energy whose separation increases with the range of inter-site Hubbard parameters. Within our framework, the calculated band gaps reflect mean-field ground states with extended Hubbard interactions, in closer agreement with experimental estimates. The tight-binding formulation further enables efficient treatment of large rhombohedral chiral systems, including twisted multilayer graphene."

      "summary": "Nanoscale defects such as Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers can serve as sensitive and non-invasive probes of electromagnetic fields and fluctuations from materials, which in turn can be used to characterize these systems. Here we specifically discuss how NV centers can probe time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) phenomena in low-dimensional conductors. We argue that the difference in relaxation rates $\\Gamma_{\\pm \\hat{z}}$ of NV centers starting from $m = \\pm 1$ spin states to the ground state with $m = 0$ directly probes TRSB. The effect arises from the difference in the fluctuation spectrum of left and right-polarized electromagnetic fields emanating from such materials. In the quantum Hall setting, the NV center experiences (nearly zero) large additional contribution to its relaxation due to the presence of the material when its magnetic dipole (anti-) aligns with the external field. More generally, the difference in the relaxation rates is sensitive to the imaginary part of the wave-vector dependent Hall conductivity. We argue that this can be used to determine the Hall viscosity, which can potentially distinguish candidate fractional quantum Hall states and be used to infer the pairing angular momentum in TRSB superconductors. For the latter, we consider specifically the case of TRSB in stacked twisted Bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) flakes, which have recently been investigated experimentally and are suggested to exhibit TRSB. We show that the average relaxation rate $\\left[\\Gamma_{+\\hat{z}} + \\Gamma_{-\\hat{z}}\\right]$ near such a system exhibits a Hebel-Slichter like enhancement below $T_c$. The difference $\\Gamma_{+\\hat{z}} - \\Gamma_{-\\hat{z}}$ also inherits this peak but is only non-zero for $T < T_c$ and only in a chiral d-wave superconductor. We provide concrete estimates for observing this effect."

Our results provide a unified picture of the phase diagram of 2d exciton-polariton condensates under incoherent pumping, and shed light on recent experimental and numerical observations."

Such an exotic spin configuration potentially exhibits distinctly different dynamics from that of the common skyrmion tube that exhibits a homogeneous chirality; yet these dynamics have not been ascertained so far. Here we reveal the distinct features of current-induced dynamics that result from the hybrid chiral skyrmion tube structure in synthetic antiferromagnetic (SyAFM) multilayers. Strikingly, the SyAFM hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes exhibit a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect in the flow regime. The non-reciprocity can even be tuned by the degree of magnetic compensation in the SyAFM systems. Our theoretical modeling qualitatively corroborates that the non-reciprocity stems from the dynamic oscillation of skyrmion helicity during its current-induced motion. The findings highlight the critical role of the internal degrees of freedom of these complex skyrmion tubes for their current-induced dynamics."

This phase is stable over a broad pressure-temperature range and exhibits a pressure-induced ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. In this study, we revealed that dhcp iron hydride exhibits the Invar-like behaviour and its thermal expansion becomes negative at elevated pressures by X-ray diffraction. Our findings, supported by DFT+DMFT calculations, demonstrate that these anomalous volume changes are governed by magnetic transitions.

While laser activation induces rapid horizontal motion (1mm/s--1cm/s) by thermal Marangoni flow, the particle exhibits unexpected periodic circular motions or intermittent irregular motions. We show that the periodic trajectories are the result of a coupling between the self-propulsion of the particle and the spatiotemporal droplet thickness changes. We propose a simple model where the properties of the active particle trajectories are governed by capillary forces and torques due to the confinement of the particle in the thin droplet."

We apply it in experiments of a Brownian probe particle confined and driven by an optical potential and suspended in a nonlinear and non-Markovian fluid.

To treat this finite barrier problem, we adopt an independent-band approach in dealing with boundary conditions. The effects of different system parameters are investigated, including the width of the out-of-plane confining well, the size of the dot, and silicon concentration in the confining layers. The more accurate finite-barrier model results in the non-negligible dependence of the anisotropic $g$-factor on the choice of boundary conditions and on the silicon concentration in the barrier. Furthermore, while the ideal model of a planar dot with a square-well heterostructure already has an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, realistic effects arising from the experimental setup may give rise to additional contributions. We investigate the impact from the top-gate electric field and the residual tensile strain on the qubit states. The results indicate that these effects are important contributions to the total spin-orbit coupling which enables fast electric control."

Notably, we demonstrate that these parameters regulate the number of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological regime. Our setup further allows for the identification of three distinct topological phases, the differentiation between one-dimensional (1D) Majorana edge (either flat/dispersive and arising from intrinsic 2D $p$-wave pairing) and localized Majorana end modes, and an analysis of their hybridization through the Josephson current. In particular, the Josephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump due to the edge modes and pronounced hump in the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing case, directly linked to the hybridized Majorana modes. Moreover, our study opens a possible interesting avenue to distinguish between 1D Majorana edge modes and zero-dimensional end modes via Josephson current signatures."

For example, the combination of $V$-type level structure and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, making the neutral atomic excitations behave like charged particles in a magnetic field. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems (and arrays in general) focuses on the single-excitation regime. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the harmful divergences near the light cone can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces."

Starting from a local attractive model and using path-integral formalism, we derive an effective action by decoupling the superconducting order parameter into amplitude and phase components in a gauge-invariant manner. Perturbative techniques are applied to the phase fluctuation sector to derive an effective phase-only XY model for disordered superconducting systems. Solving the saddle-point Green's function using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory, we calculate the distributions of nearest-neighbor couplings for various disorder strengths. A single-peak distribution is observed for low disorder strength, which becomes bimodal with one peak at negative couplings as the disorder strength increases. The local phase stiffness remains randomly distributed throughout the lattice and shows no correlation with pairing amplitudes. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness ($J_s$) is studied using Monte Carlo simulations. At strong disorder and low temperatures, $J_s$ increases with increasing temperature, exhibiting anomalous behavior that may indicate the onset of a glassy transition. Additionally, calculations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter in this disorder regime suggest the emergence of a $phase$-$glass$ state at very low temperatures."

It has been remarked that the quasicrystal ``inherits\" topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall model. We show this explicitly by introducing the Fibonacci-Hall model as a link between a 1D quasicrystal and the magnetic problems. We show here how Chern numbers for bands in periodic approximants of quasicrystals can be computed, along with gap labels. The Chern numbers are thus seen as a consequence of a flux parameter $\\phi^S$ induced by the geometry of winding in 2D space of the quasicrystal. We show the existence of lines of Lifshitz transitions in the phase space of the model. These are marked by change of Chern number and disappearance of edge states. The proposed extrapolation method can be generalized to higher dimensional 2D and 3D quasicrystals, where higher order Chern numbers could be computed, and related to experimentally measurable transport quantities."

      "summary": "The emergence of distinctly sub-diffusive scaling in the vicinity of an anomalous non-thermal fixed point is discussed in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas in the superfluid phase, carrying ensembles of vortices and antivortices with zero net angular momentum. The observed scaling behavior reflects coarsening dynamics driven by the mutual annihilation of vortices and antivortices, with the mean inter-defect distance growing algebraically over time as $\\ell_\\text{v}(t)\\sim t^{\\,\\beta}$. A sub-diffusive ($\\beta<1/2$) exponent $\\beta\\approx0.2$ is extracted for various parameter regimes, initial conditions, and dipolar configurations from both scaling occupation-number spectra and the evolution of inter-defect distances as well as the corresponding total vortex densities. As vortex-antivortex annihilation progresses, excitations of the background condensate increase. This gives rise to a transition in the scaling behavior at late times, toward a non-thermal fixed point governed by diffusion-type scaling with $\\beta\\approx1/2$ as expected for the mutual annihilation of well-separated vortex-antivortex dipoles. While the temporal scaling with $\\beta$ does not depend significantly on the strength and anisotropy of the dipolar interactions and thus underlines the universality of the anomalous as well as diffusion-type non-thermal fixed points, we find distinctly different vortex patterns resulting in the dipolar case. While in the superfluid with contact interactions only, same-sign vortices tend to cluster and form large-scale eddies, in the dipolar and tilted cases, roton excitations appear to prevent such motion, giving rather rise to a maximisation of distances between vortices of either sign."

      "summary": "In spintronics, the spin Hall effect has been widely used to generate and detect spin currents in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling such as Pt and Ta. Recently, its orbital counterpart has drawn attention as a new tool to generate and detect orbital currents and thus investigate orbital transport parameters. In this study, we investigate vanadium (V), a $3d$ transition metal with weak spin-orbit coupling but with a theoretically large orbital Hall conductivity. We measure a large Hanle magnetoresistance in V thin films with a magnitude comparable to that of heavy metals and at least one order of magnitude higher than the spin Hall magnetoresistance observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/V bilayer, pointing to the orbital Hall origin of the effect. A fit of the magnetic-field dependence and thickness dependence of the Hanle magnetoresistance to the standard diffusion model allows us to quantify the orbital diffusion length (~2 nm) and the orbital Hall conductivity (~78 ($\\hbar/2e$) $\\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$) of V. The obtained orbital Hall conductivity is two orders of magnitude smaller than theoretical calculations of the intrinsic value, suggesting there is an important role of disorder."

We demonstrate that carefully chosen values for this parameter, ideally smaller than those conventionally met in the literature, are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, we show that convergence is in practice achievable only when the update strengths for both the object and probe are relatively small compared to what is found in literature. Additionally we demonstrate that under low electron doses, the reconstructions initial error increases when the update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which the algorithms are trapped in local minima. These findings highlight the need for carefully optimized reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography, especially when working with low electron doses, ensuring both effective convergence and correctness of the result."

By combining experimental results with microscopic simulations, we dissect individual intervalley coupling mechanisms and reveal the crucial role of phonon-assisted scattering in the fast decay of the A exciton circular dichroism and the formation of the dichroism of opposite polarity for the B exciton. We further provide a consistent description of the valley depolarization driven by the combined action of Coulomb scattering processes and indicate the presence of efficient single spin-flip mechanisms.

Using a classical-to-quantum mapping -- where the rate matrix of the stochastic KCHP corresponds to a spin Hamiltonian, and the equilibrium probability distribution to the quantum ground state -- we develop a systematic perturbation theory to calculate the diffusion constant; the hydrodynamics of the KCHPs is determined by the low-energy properties of the spin Hamiltonian, which we analyse with the standard Holstein-Primakoff spin-wave expansion. For the triangular hopping we consider, we show that \\textit{non-interacting} spin-wave theory predicts the \\textit{exact} diffusion constant. We conjecture this holds for all KCHPs with (i) hard-core occupancy, (ii) parity-symmetry, and (iii) where the hopping processes are given by three-site gates -- that is, where hopping between two sites is conditioned on the occupancy of a third. We further show that there are corrections to the diffusion constant when the KCHP is described by \\textit{four}-site gates, which we calculate at leading order in the semi-classical $1/S$ expansion. We support all these conclusions with numerical simulations."

Below its Curie temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1]. By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts."

      "summary": "In very clean solid-state systems, where carrier-carrier interactions dominate over any other scattering mechanisms, the flow of electrons can be described within a hydrodynamic framework. In these cases, analogues of viscous fluid phenomena have been experimentally observed. However, experimental studies of electron hydrodynamics have so far been limited to the low velocity, linear response regime. At velocities approaching the speed of sound, the electronic fluid is expected to exhibit compressible behaviour where nonlinear effects and discontinuities such as shocks and choked flow have long been predicted. This compressible regime remains unexplored in electronic systems, despite its promise of strongly nonlinear flow phenomena. Here, we demonstrate compressible electron flow in bilayer graphene through an electronic de Laval nozzle, a structure that accelerates charge carriers past the electronic speed of sound, until they slow down suddenly in a shock. Discontinuities in transport measurements and local flattening of potential in Kelvin probe measurements are consistent with a viscous electron shock front and the presence of supersonic electron flow, and are not consistent with Ohmic or ballistic flow. Breaking the sound barrier in electron liquids opens the door for novel, intrinsically nonlinear electronic devices beyond the paradigm of incompressible flow."

We explore both coherent and incoherent neutron scattering at temperatures above the transition temperature into the superionic phase to explore the correlated motion of hopping anions. Refinements of the incoherent QENS yield residence times and jump probabilities between lattice sites in good agreement with previous studies, confirming that ionic hopping along nearest-neighbor directions is the most probable conduction pathway. However, the coherent QENS reveals evidence of de Gennes narrowing, indicating the importance of ionic correlations in the conduction mechanism.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors."

This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \\cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this \"entanglement gauge theory\" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit."

Upon removal from the interior of the material, these porous media have the tendency to reabsorb air from the surrounding, acting as a suction pump. Therefore, the technique used to convert porous media into a pump, consists of degassing the material to remove their air inside. The suction property when recovering the air, can be used to move a liquid through a microfluidic channel. Porous media pumps are very accurate devices to move liquids in a completely controlled way. {By studying the dynamics of the liquid front moved by these pumps, it is possible to extract characteristic properties of both the fluid and the porous material.} In this article, we have developed a theoretical mathematical model that precisely characterizes the dynamics of a liquid moved by a degassed porous media pump through a microchannel by comparing it with experimental data. {We have seen the differences between sealing the external surface of the pump so that it cannot absorb air from the outside, both mathematically and experimentally.} We have observed that, in all cases, the theory fits satisfactorily with the experiments, corroborating the validity of the model. The creation of microfluidic pumps using porous media can be a very useful tool in various fields due to its long operating time, small size and the fact that it operates without any external power source."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Simulating noninteracting fermion systems is a common task in computational many-body physics. In absence of translational symmetries, modeling free fermions on $N$ modes usually requires poly$(N)$ computational resources. While often moderate, these costs can be prohibitive in practice when large systems are considered. We present several free-fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with substantially reduced computational costs. The memory costs are exponentially improved, poly log$(N)$. The runtime improvement, compared to the best known classical algorithms, is either exponential or significantly polynomial, depending on the geometry of the problem. The simulation of free-fermion dynamics belongs to the BQP-hard complexity class. This implies (under standard assumptions) that our algorithm yields an exponential speedup for any classical algorithm at least for some geometries. The key technique in our algorithm is the block-encoding of objects such as correlation matrices and Green's functions into a unitary. We demonstrate how such unitaries can be efficiently realized as quantum circuits, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians. The special cases of disordered and inhomogeneous lattices, as well as large non-lattice graphs, are presented in detail. Finally, we show that our simulation algorithm generalizes to other promising targets, including free boson systems."

Furthermore, the revival acquires a universal character once the system size exceeds the localization length of the edge modes.

Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage \\emph{reciprocal space}, the natural domain for periodic crystals, and construct a Fourier series representation from fractional coordinates and reciprocal lattice vectors with learnable filters. Building on this principle, we introduce the reciprocal space-based geometry network (\\textbf{ReciNet}), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Experimental results on standard benchmarks JARVIS, Materials Project, and MatBench demonstrate that ReciNet achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across a range of crystal property prediction tasks. Additionally, we explore a model extension to multi-property prediction with the mixture-of-experts, which demonstrates high computational efficiency and reveals positive transfer between correlated properties. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction."

The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the transition rate with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not couple to the heat flow, causing the detector to only register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model."

Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of local observables as well as for correlation functions. In addition, it permits symmetries that are broken in the ansatz to be restored, which provides a systematic means of improving the accuracy of the ansatz."

This wide bandwidth is enabled by reducing the curvature of the dispersion in the signal band while suppressing detrimental mixing processes. With 2393 rf-SQUIDs our device has a comparable number of nonlinear elements, but achieves ten times higher saturation power than previous works, showing that using rf-SQUIDs results in a more favorable trade-off between device length and saturation power. Harnessing wideband characterization techniques we determine the TWPA's excess noise above the quantum limit to be 0.8 to 1.5 photons. In addition, we validate signal-to-noise ratio improvement as a practical measure for tuning the TWPA to minimize the total system noise, and demonstrate that its optimum does not coincide with the highest gain."

Combined, our new laws recover the well-known scaling for test error at convergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems, and it effectively incorporates nonlocal information. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable, as it can replace almost all previous uses of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models."

In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While previous work has studied different scaling regimes for transformers, an asymptotically exact, down-to-the constant prescription for how to initialise transformers has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through deep transformers with self-attention, layer normalisation, skip connections and MLP. Our theory yields a simple algorithm to compute trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. We overcome the key challenge, an exact treatment of the self-attention layer, by establishing a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We also analyse gradients in the backward path and determine the regime where gradients vanish at initialisation. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework through three case studies. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantee smooth training."

Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems."

We focus on the evolution of the fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of freedom in the electronic states of an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two bosonic modes.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a limited number of different circuit realizations."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction is an essential prerequisite for designing materials with targeted properties. Yet, it is still an open challenge in materials design and drug discovery. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting three-dimensional non-polymeric crystal structures remains elusive. In this work, we focus on the molecular assembly problem, where a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Such a simplified formulation provides a useful approximation to the actual problem. However, while recent state-of-the-art methods have increasingly adopted sophisticated techniques, the underlying learning objective remains ill-posed. We propose a better formulation that introduces a loss function capturing key geometric molecular properties while ensuring permutation invariance over $\\mathcal{S}$. Remarkably, we demonstrate that within this framework, a simple regression model already outperforms prior approaches, including flow matching techniques, on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated non-polymeric subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD)."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a lasing system that is driven by a current of bosonic (quasi-) particles via a dissipative three-mode mixing process. A semi-classical analysis of this system predicts distinct dynamical regimes, where both the cavity mode and the gain medium can undergo lasing transitions. Of particular interest is an intermediate self-pulsing phase that exhibits the characteristics of an excitable system and converts random input signals into separated, quasi-periodic pulses at the output. By performing exact Monte-Carlo simulations, we extend this analysis into the quantum regime and show that despite being dominated by huge bosonic particle number fluctuations, this effect of coherence resonance survives even for rather low average photon numbers. Our system thus represents a intriguing model for an excitable quantum many-body system with practical relevance for quantum detectors or autonomous quantum machines. As an illustration, we discuss the realization of this system with superconducting quantum circuits and its application as a number-resolved avalanche detector for microwave photons."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The locations of the classical and quantum crossover are consistent with each other, reflecting quantum-classical correspondence despite the noncommutativity of the infinite-spin and infinite-time limits and the impact of entanglement, quantified via the entanglement entropy between subsystems."

      "summary": "Nature Communications, Published online: 29 September 2025; doi:10.1038/s41467-025-63578-w The critical behaviour of phase transitions encodes information about the nature of the phase transition, however, extracting critical exponents associated with the correlation length and relaxation time is challenging. Here, taking the well-studied van der Waals magnet, Fe3GeTe2, Li, Ding, Wang, and coauthors use NV-centre based magnetometry to study critical fluctuations."

Here it is found that these textures can form in free-standing CuInP2S6, and that mechanical force can generate high-density domains."

Here, by growing interlocked monoclinic and tetragonal polar nanoregions in (K,Na)NbO3 thin films, highly linear strains of up to 1.1% are reported at frequencies up to 105 Hz."
