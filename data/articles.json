      "summary": "Moiré materials exhibit a rich spectrum of correlated phases, most notably superconductivity and insulating behavior driven by interactions. Existing theories often rely on mean-field approximations, which miss important correlation effects. Here, the authors build a many-body perturbation theory tailored to moiré systems, using Green’s functions to go beyond mean-field. Their approach captures symmetry-breaking states, finite-temperature transitions, and self-consistent corrections to electronic properties. This framework opens a new route to better understand how interactions shape the rich physics of moiré materials. [Phys. Rev. B 112, 075146] Published Fri Aug 22, 2025"

This fundamental limitation has now been overcome using a scheme that combines frequency control with microwave driving, enabling universal implementation of arbitrary two-qubit operations."

Entangling gates have now been demonstrated between two of these qubits."
