      "summary": "The authors challenge a long-standing view of Ta 2 NiSe 5 as an excitonic insulator by revealing a nonexcitonic origin for its phase transitions. Using systematic density functional theory calculations across the Ta 2 Ni(Se,S) 5 series, they show that structural distortions and charge doping account for the observed metal-insulator transitions. The calculations explain measured angle-resolved photoemission spectra with excellent accuracy, reconciling conflicting experimental observations and establishing a lattice-driven mechanism for the transitions in this system.

This technique offers a pathway to scale quantum photonic circuits with integrated deterministic emitters, and can be directly applied to a wide range of photonic platforms. [Phys. Rev.

The high-temperature structure contains linear La-Pb chains, and the CDW is associated with the formation of La-Pb pairs within these chains. The presence of a low-temperature CDW transition is suggested by anomalously large thermal ellipses associated with the La atoms in the chains, potentially offering a means of searching for potential CDW compounds.
