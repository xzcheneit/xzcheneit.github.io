      "summary": "Photothermomechanical polymer film actuators stand out among the dynamic components available for soft robotics due to a combination of assets, such as capability for rapid energy transduction, wireless control, and ease of miniaturization. Despite their anticipated superior performance, several design challenges remain. These include high operational temperatures, inadequate mechanical output relative to the radiation energy provided, limited durability during repeated use, and high production costs; such factors hinder the scalability of these actuating materials in practical applications. Here, we report a viable solution by substituting performance-enhancing nanoparticles with MXenes--carbon-based, two-dimensional materials known for their theoretical photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 100%. This led to the development of MXene-dispersed polymer trilayer actuators (MPTAs). Extensive photothermal and thermomechanical characterization demonstrated superior performance compared to previously reported actuators, with a reduced shed power demand (0.1 mW cm$^{-2}$ $^\\circ$C$^{-1}$), substantial bending capacity per irradiation power per time (0.1$^\\circ$ mW$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$), and enhanced cyclic longevity, with fatigueless operation of at least 1,000 cycles. We demonstrate three applications: A kirigami-inspired flower, parallel manipulator, and soft gripper. Additionally, these materials are cost-effective; thus, they are the optimal choice for long-term, reversible operation with efficient heat-to-work transduction."

      "summary": "The transport of solvent molecules through soft, swollen networks is critical in both natural and engineered systems. While this poroelastic flow has traditionally been explored in networks where the mesh size is comparable to the solvent molecule size, the effect of network architecture on permeability remains underexplored. Here we investigate solvent transport in linear polymer networks (LPN) and highly elastic bottlebrush elastomer networks (BBN), where the presence of densely grafted sidechains allows for control over swelling and mechanical properties. By synthesizing BBNs with systematically varied crosslinking density while maintaining constant sidechain length and grafting density, we probe the poroelastic response in the stretched backbone regime (SBB). Poroelastic relaxation indentation experiments, performed in toluene, reveal how permeability scales with crosslink density and polymer volume fraction. Compared to LPN with identical chemistry, the BBN exhibited a lower permeability scaling exponent with polymer volume fraction that closely matches the theoretical exponent. Despite architectural differences, permeability data for both networks collapse onto a single curve when plotted against dry shear modulus. Our findings demonstrate that molecular network architecture significantly influences permeability, offering new routes to tailor solvent transport in soft, swollen networks. These insights highlight BBNs as a promising platform for applications in permeable membranes, filtration, and microfluidic systems, and pave the way for further studies on how network parameters, such as sidechain length, impact permeability in these highly tunable materials."

      "summary": "The quantitative description of lubricant flow in nanoscale channels is complicated by various finite-size effects that are not taken into account in conventional thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) models. One of these effects is wall slip, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. The relationship between wall slip and thermal effects is intricate, and some authors debate whether the friction reduction observed in their experiments in the TEHL regime can be explained by either slip or viscosity reduction in heated lubricants. To disentangle these mechanisms, a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of the relationship between temperature and slip in the shear flow of a 4 cSt polyalphaolefin (PAO4) base oil in a nanoscale diamond-like carbon (DLC) channel is performed here. An Eyring law describes the relationship between slip velocity and shear stress at the solid-liquid interface for a given temperature and pressure. The same simulation campaign provides a pressure-dependent law for the interface thermal resistance (ITR) between DLC and PAO4. These constitutive laws are employed in a continuum model for lubricated parallel channels. By taking heat conduction into account and combining the slip and ITR laws with a temperature- and pressure-dependent Eyring viscosity law, questions about the competition of slip and thermal thinning of the lubricant can be answered. For DLC film thicknesses compatible with tribological experiments and applications, this model shows that slip is only relevant for very thin lubricant films that are typical of boundary lubrication, suggesting the dominance of thermal thinning in the TEHL regime."

      "summary": "Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities."

      "summary": "Underground gas storage is central to both climate mitigation and energy transition strategies, supporting both long-term carbon sequestration and seasonal hydrogen storage. A key mechanism governing the fate of injected gases is Ostwald ripening, the curvature-driven mass transfer between trapped gas ganglia in porous media. While ripening is well understood in open systems, its behavior in geometrically confined porous structures remains poorly characterized, especially over long timescales relevant to subsurface operations. Here, we present ultra-high-resolution microfluidic experiments that capture the evolution of residually trapped hydrogen over weeks in realistic, heterogeneous pore geometries under well-defined boundary conditions. We observe a distinct two-stage dynamic: a rapid local equilibration among neighboring bubbles, followed by slow global depletion driven by long-range diffusion toward low-chemical potential boundaries. Building on these insights, we develop and validate a continuum model that couples microscale capillary pressure-saturation (Pc-s) relationships, extracted via the pore-morphology method, with macroscopic diffusive transport. The model accurately predicts gas saturation evolution without fitting parameters and collapses experimental results across a range of experimental conditions. Extending the model to reservoir scales, we estimate equilibration timescales for CO2 and H2 in homogeneous sandstone aquifers. We find that ripening occurs much faster than convective dissolution in CO2 sequestration, and on timescales comparable to seasonal H2 storage operations. These findings establish a quantitative framework linking pore-scale heterogeneity to field-scale gas redistribution, with implications for the design and longevity of subsurface storage strategies."

      "summary": "The coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes (CH-NS) equations provide a powerful framework for modeling multiphase flows with diffuse interfaces, enabling simulations of droplet breakup, bubble dynamics, and hydrodynamic instabilities. These capabilities are vital in boiling heat transfer, microfluidics, coating, additive manufacturing, and oil-water separation, where resolving fluid-fluid interactions is essential. Numerically, the CH-NS system is challenging: the Cahn-Hilliard equation involves higher-order derivatives and nonlinearities, and coupling with Navier-Stokes introduces strong two-way interactions. The velocity field advects the phase field, while the evolving interface alters density and viscosity, feeding back into the flow. Variable-density and variable-viscosity systems further increase complexity, requiring accurate treatment of property contrasts without losing stability or mass conservation. To address this, we employ a decoupled pressure-projection method with finite differences on staggered grids and explicit Euler time stepping. Our formulation extends the CH-NS system to homogeneous and variable-property fluids with consistent hydrodynamic-phase-field coupling. Validation against canonical benchmarks-including bubble rise and Plateau-Taylor instability shows excellent agreement in rise velocity, interface shape, and instability wavelength. This framework establishes a reproducible foundation for multiphysics extensions such as heat transfer, phase change, and electrohydrodynamics in boiling, droplet manipulation, and electronics cooling"

      "summary": "Deep artificial neural networks have surpassed human-level performance across a diverse array of complex learning tasks, establishing themselves as indispensable tools in both social applications and scientific research. Despite these advances, the underlying mechanisms of training in artificial neural networks remain elusive. Here, we propose that artificial neural networks function as adaptive, self-organizing information processing systems in which training is mediated by the coherent coupling of strongly activated, task-specific critical neurons. We demonstrate that such neuronal coupling gives rise to Hebbian-like neural correlation graphs, which undergo a dynamic, second-order connectivity phase transition during the initial stages of training. Concurrently, the connection weights among critical neurons are consistently reinforced while being simultaneously redistributed in a stochastic manner. As a result, a precise balance of neuronal contributions is established, inducing a local concentration within the random loss landscape which provides theoretical explanation for generalization capacity. We further identify a later on convergence phase transition characterized by a phase boundary in hyperparameter space, driven by the nonequilibrium probability flux through weight space. The critical computational graphs resulting from coherent coupling also decode the predictive rules learned by artificial neural networks, drawing analogies to avalanche-like dynamics observed in biological neural circuits. Our findings suggest that the coherent coupling of critical neurons and the ensuing local concentration within the loss landscapes may represent universal learning mechanisms shared by both artificial and biological neural computation."

However, there are two exceptions to this standard case: first, anyons, which exist in 2-dimensional systems, and secondly, paraparticles, which can exist in any dimension. Paraparticles follow their non-trivial parastatistics, obeying their generalised exclusion principle.

Here, we numerically study fermion number-conserving models with long-range interactions, which under periodic boundary conditions exhibit robust topological and non-topological superconductivity, tuned by the strength of interaction [1]. We find evidence that, on the topological side, Majorana edge modes appear in open chains, manifesting as the vanishing of the energy splitting between odd- and even-parity ground states with increasing system size. Additionally, off-diagonal two-point correlation functions show nonlocal, parity-dependent edge effects consistent with Majorana phenomenology. We develop a correlation-based method revealing the spatial structure of Majorana modes in this fully interacting many-body setting."

Extending the conventional wave-packet ansatz to include interband contributions, we derive equations for the interband coefficients using the time-dependent variational principle, referred to as the wave-packet coefficient equation. Solving these equations and integrating out interband contributions yields the leading-order nonadiabatic corrections to the wave-packet Lagrangian. These corrections appear in three forms: (i) a nonadiabatic metric in real and momentum space, which we identify with the energy-gap-renormalized quantum metric, (ii) modified Berry connections associated with the motion of the wave-packet center, and (iii) an energy correction arising from spatial and temporal variations of the Hamiltonian. This metric reformulates the wave-packet dynamics as geodesic motion in phase space, enabling an analogue-gravity perspective in condensed matter systems. As an application, we analyze one-dimensional Dirac electron systems under a slowly varying exchange field $\\bm{m}$. Our results demonstrate that variations in the magnitude of $\\bm{m}$ are important to nonadiabatic dynamics, in sharp contrast to the adiabatic regime where directional variations of $\\bm{m}$ are crucial."

The network structure formed by this entanglement, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we utilize network science to investigate the entanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through experiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we demonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number of links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a giant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose a continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed transition. Additionally, we find that particle's opening angle significantly affects mechanical bonding and, consequently, the network structure. This work highlights the potential of network-based approaches to study entangled materials, paving the way for advancements in applications ranging from mechanical metamaterials to entangled robot swarms."

We find that the FLM effectively captures the bulk behavior of the DWRLG in both low- and high-density phases, suggesting that phase transitions in these models may share a universality class. Under the effect of the drive, the FLM additionally reveals an intermediate regime, not reported in the previous DWRLG studies, characterized by ``irregular stripes\" with widely fluctuating widths, contrasting with the ``regular\", well-ordered stripes found at higher densities. In this intermediate phase, the system exhibits long-range order, predominantly perpendicular to the drive direction. To construct a continuum description, we derive two coupled partial differential equations via a gradient expansion of the FLM mean mass-transfer equations, supplemented with additive noise. Designing a numerical solver using the pseudospectral method with dealiasing and stochastic time differencing, we reproduce the low-density microemulsion phase (characterized by a non-zero characteristic wavenumber $q^*$) and perpendicular stripes at high density. We identify the non-zero difference in the characteristic velocities of the fields as a necessary condition for perpendicular stripe formation in the high-density phase. The continuum model also uncovers novel behaviors not previously observed in the FLM, such as stripes aligned parallel to the drive and chaotic patterns. This work highlights how the interplay of external drive, particle interactions, and noise can lead to a rich phenomenology in strongly driven binary mixtures."

Within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), the paradigmatic single-band Hubbard model (SBHM) displays such criticality only above a finite-temperature endpoint. In contrast, the modified periodic Anderson model (MPAM) is a rare example known to host a surface of genuinely continuous Mott quantum critical points (QCPs) at zero temperature. Using DMFT with the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver, we investigate the finite-temperature, real-frequency properties of the MPAM. Our central finding is the emergence of quantum critical scaling in the electrical resistivity, with critical exponents $z_{\\text{met}} = 0.76$ and $z_{\\text{ins}} = 0.66$ on the metallic and insulating sides, respectively. These values fall within the range reported for the SBHM, suggesting that both transitions are governed by a common universality class. We further substantiate the presence of local quantum criticality by demonstrating robust $\\omega/T$ scaling in single- and two-particle correlation functions. Finally, we identify novel transport signatures in the optical conductivity, where the distinct evolution of two isosbestic points serves as a unique fingerprint of the QCP. These results establish the MPAM as a canonical model for investigating genuine Mott quantum criticality and support the existence of a universal framework for this fundamental phenomenon."

In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized spins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the Fe-derived magnetic excitations are softened primarily by damping, becoming overdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show the absence of electronic structure reconstruction effects such as the nematic band splitting. We propose a localized spin model that explicitly incorporates substitutional disorder and Cr local moments, successfully reproducing our key observations. These results reveal a case where disorder dominates over charge doping in the case of a correlated Hund's metal."

Formulating the problem in a frame of reference moving with the arrowhead velocity, streamlines, which are also pathlines in this frame, enables the identification of two distinct topological regions linked to two stagnation points. The streamlines help connecting the spatial distribution of polymer stress within the sheets and the dynamics of polymers transported by the flow. Using stresslines, lines parallel to the eigenvectors of polymer stress, a novel formulation of the viscoelastic stress term in the momentum transport equation proposes a more intuitive interpretation of the relation between the curvature of the stresslines, and the variation of stress along these lines, with the local flow topology. An approximation of this formulation is shown to explain the pressure jump observed in the arrowhead structure as a function of the local curvature of the polymer stress sheet."

      "summary": "We study charge transport across the metal-insulator crossover in the half-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model, with particular emphasis on precision control. The dynamic current-current correlation function is obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit, and the optical conductivity is extracted using numerical analytic continuation. To achieve this, we develop a multiscale approach: the non-perturbative low-frequency behavior is computed using the unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, while the high-frequency physics is captured via a self-consistent (semi-)analytic diagrammatic theory. We found that across a broad temperature range where the DC resistivity displays anomalous scaling, $\\sim T^\\alpha$ with $0<\\alpha\\lesssim 1$, the Nernst-Einstein relation implies the diffusion constant with the characteristic $\\sim 1/\\sqrt{T}$ \"strange metal\" behavior. It was also revealed that the insulating regime is entered through a peculiar non-Fermi liquid state-which we call a Pseudogap Metal-characterized by insulating charge compressibility coexisting with metallic transport. Diagrammatically, the high-temperature incoherent transport is captured by the dressed polarization bubble, whereas near the metal-insulator crossover, the effective interaction vertex between opposite-spin particles is responsible for transferring the Drude weight to a high-frequency continuum."

      "summary": "Thermoelectric materials can generate clean energy by transforming waste heat into electricity. The effectiveness of thermoelectric materials is measured by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT. The quest for high ZT materials has drawn extensive research experimentally and theoretically. However, due to the vast material space, finding high ZT materials is time-consuming and costly. To improve the efficiency of discovering new thermoelectric materials, recent studies have employed machine learning with databases to search for high ZT candidates. In this work, we examine the effects of adding various physical concepts on the performance of machine learning models in predicting TE properties. The objective is to improve the model ability to capture the underlying physics in designing TE materials. These concepts include short range order and crystal structure class. Results show some improvements in accuracy. However, the current models do not distinguish between dilute alloys and concentrated alloys, rendering them inadequate in predicting doping effects. To better capture the electronic band structure effect from doping, we included various dopant properties as features. This increases the prediction accuracy in doped materials. Furthermore, we used a genetic algorithm to rank features for various thermoelectric properties to provide physical insight into key parameters in designing thermoelectric materials."

      "summary": "Alkaline earth stannates have emerged as promising transparent conducting oxides due to their wide band gaps and high room-temperature electron mobilities. Among them, CaSnO$_3$ possesses the widest band gap, yet reported mobilities vary widely and are highly sample-dependent, leaving its intrinsic limit unclear. Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in CaSnO$_3$ across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ~10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, the phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental report. Our work highlights the substantial untapped conductivity in CaSnO$_3$, establishing it as a compelling ultrawide bandgap semiconductor for transparent and high-power electronic applications."

      "summary": "This study aims to unravel the micro-mechanical underpinnings of the emergence of the fractocohesive length scale as a central concept in modern fracture mechanics. A thermodynamically consistent damage and fracture model for elastomers is developed, incorporating elements of polymer chain statistical mechanics. This approach enables the direct incorporation of polymer chain response into a continuum gradient enhanced damage formulation, that in turn allows a physically meaningful description of diffuse chain damage and corresponding fracture events. Through a series of numerical experiments, we simulate crack propagation and extract the fracture energy as an output of the model, while keeping track of the micromechanical signatures of diffuse chain damage that accommodate fracture propagation. Furthermore, we investigate flaw sensitivity and demonstrate that when flaw sizes are smaller than a critical length scale, the material response becomes largely insensitive to notch size. Finally, by combining the fracture toughness and the work to rupture, we identify a fractocohesive length of the material, corresponding to the full width of the damage zone and representing the region where the irreversible dissipation process (i.e., bond scission) is happening. As this region is dictated in the proposed FED model through the introduction of a length scale associated with the non-local nature of the damage and fracture process, the emerging relationship of the two length scales is discussed, effectively connecting the microscopic characteristics of damage to the effective macroscopic response."

The equilibria are modelled by minimisers of an appropriately defined free energy, with an empirical coupling term between $\\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\\mathbf{Q}_c$. We demonstrate two phase transitions in spatially homogeneous 3D BCN systems at fixed temperatures: a first-order nematic-paranematic transition followed by a paranematic-isotropic phase transition driven by the GS-cluster coupling. We also numerically compute and give heuristic insights into solution landscapes of confined BCN systems on 2D square domains, tailored by the GS-cluster coupling, temperature and external fields. This benchmark example illustrates the potential of this generalised model to capture tunable director profiles, cluster properties and macroscopic biaxiality."

However, challenges arise in reducing wave leakage and noise from fabrication imperfections. The emergence of robust wave manipulations based on topological BICs (TBICs) offers promising solutions. Traditionally, TBICs of different dimensions are observed separately in distinct systems. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the coexistence of two-dimensional surface TBICs and one-dimensional hinge TBICs in a single three-dimensional phononic crystal system. Such an unprecedented dimensional hierarchy of TBICs is triggered by the mechanism of separability and protected by the valley Chern numbers. Notably, these TBICs inherit dispersive propagation characteristics from valley topology and can propagate robustly against defects without leakage. Our findings offer an efficient approach to multidimensional TBICs and can be applied in designing highly efficient acoustic devices for wave trapping and manipulation in multidimensional environments."

The model tracks the motion of grain boundaries under the effect of driving forces stemming from grain boundary curvature and differential deuterium concentration accumulation. We apply the model to experimentally-synthesized W polycrystals under deuterium saturated conditions consistent with those of the ARC concept design, and find fast grain growth kinetics in the material region adjacent to the plasma (at 1400 K, <100 seconds for full transformation), while the microstructure is stable deep inside the material (several days to complete at a temperature of 1000 K). Our simulations suggest that monolithic W fabricated using conventional techniques will be highly susceptible to grain growth in the presence of any driving force at temperatures above 1000 K."

      "summary": "The time-reversal symmetry ($\\mathcal{T}$) breaking is a signature of ferromagnetism, giving rise to such phenomena as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and orbital magnetism (OM). Nevertheless, $\\mathcal{T}$ can be also broken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or altermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light of this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest ferromagnetic one, i.e. within a minimal unit cell containing only one magnetic cite. We show that such presentation is possible due to the special form of the spin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice hosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry, combined with the lattice translations, imposes a severe constraint on the form of the SO interaction, which becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\\{ \\mathcal{S}| {\\bf t} \\}$, combining the $180^{\\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\\mathcal{S}$) with the lattice shift ${\\bf t}$, connecting antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices. This is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets, which justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to the local coordinate frame with one magnetic cite per cell. It naturally explains the emergence of AHE and OM, and provides transparent expressions for these properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating between nearest neighbors as well as the orthorhombic strain of the next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. The idea is illustrated on a number of examples, using realistic models derived from first-principles calculations. These examples include two-dimensional square lattice, monoclinic VF$_4$ and CuF$_2$, and RuO$_2$-type materials with the tetragonal symmetry."

Due to the limited availability of suitable chiral-crystal materials, their unconventional superconductivity (SC) remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of unconventional SC in the La(Rh,Ir)Si family of materials by combining muon-spin spectroscopy, band-structure calculations, and perturbation theory. This family, characterized by a double-helix chiral structure, hosts exotic multifold fermions that are absent in other topological chiral crystals. While LaRhSi behaves as a fully-gapped superconductor, the substitution of 4$d$-Rh by 5$d$-Ir significantly enhances the SOC and leads to the emergence of topological nodal-line SC in LaIrSi. The developed model shows that the nodal-line SC arises from an isotropic SOC with a specific strength. Such an exotic mechanism expands our conventional understanding of material candidates for unconventional SC, which typically rely on a significantly anisotropic SOC to promote the triplet pairing. Our work establishes a new type of phase diagram, which provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering unconventional SC in chiral crystals. Furthermore, it calls for renewed investigations of unconventional SC in other widely studied superconductors with a chiral structure."

Using metadynamics with coordination-number-based collective variables and SNAP machine-learned interatomic potential, we uncover atomistic mechanisms governing the transformation of cubic and hexagonal diamond into post-diamond phases above 1.5 TPa. The transition initiates via homogeneous nucleation of nanoscale liquid droplets, which rapidly crystallize into either BC8 (below 1.8 TPa) or simple cubic phases (above 2.1 TPa), once the liquid nucleus surpasses a critical size. Favorable conditions for synthesizing BC8 are identified near 1.8 TPa and 3500--5000 K. Decompression pathways from simple cubic and BC8 phases were also simulated to study possible experimental recovery of post-diamond carbon allotropes at ambient conditions. We also find a new metastable low-enthalpy structure with four-coordinated carbon atoms and space group P222. Our insights provide a theoretical foundation for experimental discovery of ultra-dense carbon phases under extreme conditions."

However, monolayer altermagnets maintain degenerate band gaps at the high-symmetry X and Y points in the Brillouin zone, manifesting a paravalley phase characterized by unpolarized valley states. In this work, we demonstrate that spontaneously broken valley degeneracy can be achieved through interlayer sliding in engineered M$_2$A$_2$B and M$_2$AA$'$B bilayer altermagnets by first-principles calculations and minimal microscopic model. We propose a promising route to achieve antiferromagnetic half-metal driven by sliding and emergent ferrovalley phase without applied electric field, which is realized in the V$_2$SSeO engineered bilayer. Our calculations also reveal that Mo$_2$O$_2$O exhibits the largest valley splitting gap of ~0.31 eV, making it a promising candidate for valley-spin valve devices. Furthermore, band structure calculations on Mo$_2$AA$'$O materials demonstrate that increasing the difference in atomic number ($\\Delta$Z) between A and A$'$ site atoms effectively enhances valley polarization. This work establishes a novel platform for discovering and controlling ferrovalley states in altermagnetic systems."

      "summary": "Engineering and probing excitonic properties at the nanoscale remains a central challenge in quantum photonics and optoelectronics. While exciton confinement via electrical control and strain engineering has been demonstrated in 2D semiconductors, substantial nanoscale heterogeneity limits the scalability of 2D quantum photonic device architectures. In this work, we use cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to probe the excitonic landscape of monolayer $WS_2$ under electrostatic gating. Exploiting the high spatial resolution of the converged electron beam, we resolve a homojunction arising between gated and ungated regions. Moreover, we reveal an exciton confinement channel arising from an unconventional doping mechanism driven by the interplay between the electron beam and the applied gate fields. These findings offer new insights into the optoelectronic behavior of monolayer semiconductors under the combined influence of electron-beam excitation and electrostatic gating. Our approach provides a pathway for exciton manipulation at the nanoscale and opens opportunities for controlling quantum-confined exciton transport in two-dimensional materials."

In this work, we demonstrate that quantum shot noise offers a direct and robust fingerprint of Andreev reflection, distinguishing between retro and specular processes in graphene-superconductor, graphene-superconductor-graphene, and superconductor-graphene-superconductor junctions. At the graphene-superconductor interface, exact reflection amplitudes obtained from full wavefunction matching within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism capture retro and specular regimes. The associated Fano factor exhibits distinct Fermi-level-dependent signatures, with retro Andreev reflection suppressing and specular Andreev reflection enhancing the shot noise. Extensions to graphene-superconductor-graphene and superconductor-graphene-superconductor configurations reveal how the transmission spectrum and, consequently, the noise profile are modified in the presence of multiple interfaces, coherent quasiparticle interference, and superconducting phase variations. Our findings establish shot noise spectroscopy as a potent and experimentally viable probe for differentiating Andreev reflection types in graphene-based quantum devices, providing complementary insights beyond conventional conductance measurements."

Each cycle contains two steps: (i) changing the trap frequency to enable unitary evolution under a Hamiltonian, and (ii) reapplying the original trap at stochastic times to cool the gas back to its initial state. This protocol effectively makes it an open quantum system and drives it into a unique nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). We analytically and numerically characterize the NESS, uncovering a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure in the joint probability density function (JPDF) of the positions. The JPDF in the CIID structure is a product of Gaussians with a common random variance, which is then averaged with respect to its distribution, making the JPDF non-factorizable, giving rise to long-range emergent dynamical correlations. The average density profile of the gas shows significant deviations from the initial Gaussian shape. We further compute the order and the gap statistics, revealing universal scaling in both bulk and edge regimes. We also analyze the full counting statistics, exposing rich parameter-dependent structure. Our results demonstrate how stochastic quenches can generate nontrivial correlations in quantum many-body systems."

      "summary": "Atomic vibrations play a critical role in phonon-assisted electron transitions at defects in solids. However, accurate phonon calculations in defect systems are often hindered by the high computational cost of large-supercell first-principles calculations. Recently, foundation models, such as universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), emerge as a promising alternative for rapid phonon calculations, but the quantitatively low accuracy restricts its fundamental applicability for high-level defect phonon calculations, such as nonradiative carrier capture rates. In this paper, we propose a \"one defect, one potential\" strategy in which an MLIP is trained on a limited set of perturbed supercells. We demonstrate that this strategy yields phonons with accuracy comparable to density functional theory (DFT), regardless of the supercell size. The predicted accuracy of defect phonons is validated by phonon frequencies, Huang-Rhys factors, and phonon dispersions. Further calculations of photoluminescence (PL) spectra and nonradiative capture rates based on this defect-specific model also show good agreements with DFT results, meanwhile reducing the computational expenses by more than an order of magnitude. Our approach provides a practical pathway for studying defect phonons in 10$^4$-atom large supercell with high accuracy and efficiency."

For narrow junctions (w \\approx 1{\\mu}m) the circuit exhibits a pronounced dc branch that terminates at a critical current I_c = 9(1) x 10^3 s^{-1}; above this threshold the system switches to an ac, resistive regime. Classical-field simulations that include the moving barriers quantitatively reproduce both the nonlinear I-{\\Delta}{\\mu} curve and the measured I_c, validating the underlying microscopic picture. Analysis of the ensuing phase dynamics shows that dissipation is mediated by the nucleation and traversal of vortex-antivortex pairs through the junctions, while the bulk condensate remains globally phase-locked \\textemdash direct evidence of the ring's topological constraint enforcing quantized circulation.

Utilizing a multistage Lenz lens system, directly sputtered onto diamond anvils, we realize a radio-frequency (RF, 50 kHz - 200 MHz) transformer with a sample, of 50-100 microns in diameter, as its core. This configuration enables efficient transfer and focusing of an electromagnetic field within the diamond anvil cell's chamber. Consequently, the transmitted RF signal exhibits high sensitivity to variations in the sample's surface conductivity and magnetic permeability. We validate this method by determining the critical temperatures ($T_{\\text{c}}$) of known superconductors, including NbTi, MgB$_2$, Hg-1223, BSCCO, and REBCO in various magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic ordering temperatures of Gd and Tb, and the metal-insulator transition in VO$_2$. Notably, we apply this technique to the (La,Ce)H$_{10-12}$ superhydride at a pressure of about 150 GPa. The observed superconducting transition, at 215-220 K, is noticeably higher than the $T_{\\text{c}}$ determined via traditional electrical-resistance measurements (200-205 K), demonstrating the method's enhanced sensitivity. Moreover, we show how multiple repetitions of the RF experiment with the La-Ce superhydride make it possible to detect the increase in $T_{\\text{c}}$ over time up to 260-270 K. This finding opens a pathway towards reaching a critical $T_{\\text{c}}$ above 0$^\\circ$C in the La-based superhydrides."

We show that the breathing mode corresponds to a coherent oscillation of both the hopfion core diameter and the shell width, while preserving the topological charge. An analytical domain-wall interaction model explains the weak field dependence of the shell thickness and yields a closed-form expression for the restoring stiffness. From this curvature and the collective-coordinate inertia, we derive an estimated breathing frequency in excellent agreement with micromagnetic spectra. The ability to capture the hopfion dynamics quantitatively from material constants highlights a direct route to experimental detection by ferromagnetic resonance or Brillouin light scattering, and establishes a framework for frequency-encoded control in reconfigurable spintronic devices."

It was found that the [111] surface had a perpendicular anisotropy of 1.62 meV/$\\text{\\AA}^2$, whereas the two possible [100] surfaces (Ir-rich and Mn-rich) had in-plane anisotropies of 0.13 meV/$\\text{\\AA}^2$ and 1.39 meV/$\\text{\\AA}^2$ respectively. The affect of the magnetic order of the easy and hard configurations were calculated and used to explain the relative values of the anisotropies."

      "summary": "The electronic friction-Langevin dynamics (EF-LD) offers a simplified framework for describing nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, particularly in electrochemical and molecular electronic applications. We investigate the electronic friction behavior for the Hubbard-Holstein model using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) theory. We show that electron-electron interactions lead to the formation of two energy levels in the impurity, resulting in two peaks in the electronic friction at the resonances of electron attachment or detachment with the metal's Fermi level. We further benchmark our results against mean field theory (MFT) and exact diagonalization (ED). The results calculated by ED and DMRG show strong agreement at high temperatures, suggesting the results from DMRG are reliable; however, at low temperatures, ED exhibits significant deviations relative to DMRG due to the finite-size limitations inherent in ED calculations. MFT completely fails to recover Fermi resonance in electronic friction. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the electronic friction using EF-LD. Simulations reveal differences between the electronic population and kinetic energy dynamics predicted by MFT and DMRG approaches, suggesting that MFT approach is unreliable for nonadiabatic dynamics of strongly correlated systems."

The cavity is coherently driven through a parametric medium, and all-to-all interactions between the qubits are introduced. While the nonlinear gain from the parametric drive breaks the U(1) symmetry of the standard Tavis-Cummings model, thus giving rise to superradiance with squeezed cavity fields, we show that the interactions impact the collective excitations and significantly modify the superradiant transition. Insights to the superradiant phase transitions, as well as the interaction effects, are obtained through effective models involving only a handful of low-lying collective states, under which the steady-state phase diagram of the hybrid system is faithfully reproduced. Our study is relevant to Rydberg-atom arrays coupled to a parametrically driven cavity, where the long-range interactions derive from the dipole-dipole interatomic interactions."

      "summary": "Aluminum nitride is a traditional wide-bandgap semiconductor that has been widely used in high-power electronic and optoelectronic devices. Recently, scandium-doped aluminum nitride (AlScN) was shown to host ferroelectricity with high remnant polarization and excellent thermal stability. However, its practical use is currently limited by its high coercive field, $E_c$. Understanding the atomic-scale switching mechanism is essential to guide strategies for reducing $E_c$. Here, we combine density functional theory and machine-learning molecular dynamics to investigate polarization switching mechanisms in AlScN over various Sc concentrations and applied electric fields. We find that collective switching induces excessive lattice strain and is therefore unlikely to occur. Rather, pre-existing domain walls relieve strain and lead to a distinct switching dynamics, with the associated switching mechanism being field dependent. More precisely, at low electric fields, switching proceeds via gradual domain-wall propagation, well described by the Kolmogorov-Avram-Ishibashi model; meanwhile high fields trigger additional nucleation events, producing rapid and more homogeneous reversal, whose mixed switching process is better described by the simultaneous non-linear nucleation and growth model. These findings highlight the critical role of domain-wall dynamics in nitride ferroelectrics and suggest that domain engineering provides a viable route to control coercive fields and enhance device performance."

These edge states exhibit a net circulation opposite to the particles' intrinsic rotation and lead to a pronounced accumulation at the boundary, stronger than for their achiral counterparts. The directed nature of these orbits provides a simple yet high-fidelity mechanism for chiral sorting -- even for solitary particles, unlike in T Barois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 , 238003 (2020). We propose a unified theoretical framework for boundary interactions of both chiral and achiral particles. In this model, an effective outward radial force, proportional to motility and chirality, explains the observed boundary-hugging. Our theory predicts, and our experiments confirm, a transition in the pairing of two particles of the same chirality, from apolar spinners to polar circle walkers, with increasing packing fraction of an ambient medium of beads."

      "summary": "Learning with physical systems is an emerging paradigm that seeks to harness the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of physical substrates for learning. The impetus for a paradigm shift in how hardware is used for computational intelligence stems largely from the unsustainability of artificial neural network software implemented on conventional transistor-based hardware. This Perspective highlights one promising approach using physical networks comprised of resistive memory nanoscale components with dynamically reconfigurable, self-organising electrical circuitry. Experimental advances have revealed the non-trivial interactions within these Self-Organising Memristive Networks (SOMNs), offering insights into their collective nonlinear and adaptive dynamics, and how these properties can be harnessed for learning using different hardware implementations. Theoretical approaches, including mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems, reveal deeper insights into the dynamics of SOMNs, especially during transitions between different conductance states where criticality and other dynamical phase transitions emerge in both experiments and models. Furthermore, parallels between adaptive dynamics in SOMNs and plasticity in biological neuronal networks suggest the potential for realising energy-efficient, brain-like continual learning. SOMNs thus offer a promising route toward embedded edge intelligence, unlocking real-time decision-making for autonomous systems, dynamic sensing, and personalised healthcare, by enabling embedded learning in resource-constrained environments. The overarching aim of this Perspective is to show how the convergence of nanotechnology, statistical physics, complex systems, and self-organising principles offers a unique opportunity to advance a new generation of physical intelligence technologies."

      "summary": "Although two-dimensional (2D) oxide semiconductors exhibit remarkable oxidation resistance compared to conventional 2D materials, the microscopic physical processes that govern this behavior at the atomic scale remains elusive. Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the defect formation and oxidation dynamics of the GeO${_2}$ monolayer (ML). The investigations reveal that the intrinsic GeO${_2}$ ML is resistant to oxidation due to strong electrostatic repulsion between surface oxygen ions and approaching O$_2$ molecules, effectively suppressing chemisorption. In contrast, defective GeO$_2$ ML with surface O vacancies shows vulnerability to oxidation with the O$_2$ molecule occupying the vacancy through a low-energy activation energy ($E_a$) of 0.375 eV. Remarkably, the subsequent O$_2$ dissociation into atomic species faces a higher activation barrier ($E_a$ = 1.604 eV), suggesting self-limiting oxidation behavior. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates that oxidation primarily modifies the valence bands of defective GeO${_2}$ MLs through oxygen incorporation, while the conduction bands and electron effective mass recover to pristine-like characteristics. We further proved that the high O$_2$ pressure hinders the formation of the O vacancy, while high temperature increases the oxidation rate in GeO$_2$ ML. These atomic-level insights not only advance our understanding of oxidation resistance in 2D oxides but also provide guidelines for developing stable GeO${_2}$-based nanoelectronic devices."

In this work, we systematically investigated the piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties of the hexagonal Janus InXY (X = S, Se, Te; Y = Cl, Br, I) monolayers (MLs) using first-principles calculations. Except for InSeCl ML, the remaining eight InXY MLs are stable and exhibit exceptionally high in-plane piezoelectric coefficients ($|d_{22}| = $6.07--155.27 pm/V), which exceed those of most known 2D materials. InXY MLs possess band edges straddling the water redox potentials at pH = 0. Their intrinsic vertical polarization induces an intralayer polarization field $E_{\\rm intra}$, leading to low exciton binding energies (0.44--0.78 eV). Moreover, their strong vertical piezoelectric responses ($|d_{32}|$ = 0.34--0.65 pm/V) suggest that in-plane stress can further enhance $E_{\\rm intra}$ to facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, these InXY MLs exhibit high electron mobility (101--899 cm$^2$/V/s) and a pronounced anisotropy ratio in carrier mobility, which effectively suppresses charge recombination. To optimize performance, we constructed a van der Waals heterojunction (InSI/InSeBr), which demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic properties, including enhanced redox ability, a direct Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, strong visible-light absorption, high carrier mobility, and excellent photocorrosion resistance. Our results indicate that hexagonal Janus InXY MLs and their heterojunctions are multifunctional materials integrating piezoelectricity and photocatalysis, paving the way for energy conversion applications."

Realizing practical devices typically requires magnons excited in a controlled manner to enable precise manipulation of their topological phases and transport behaviors. However, their inherent charge neutrality and a high frequency nature pose a significant challenge for nonvolatile control, especially via electric means. Herein, we propose a general strategy for electrical control of topological magnons in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators. With strong spin-layer coupling, an applied vertical electric field induces an interlayer potential imbalance that modifies intralayer Heisenberg exchanges between adjacent layers. This electric-field-driven modulation competes with the bilayer's intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, enabling the accurate tuning of the band topology and nonreciprocal dynamics of magnons. More importantly, such an electric control mechanism exhibits strong coupling with external magnetic fields, unveiling new perspectives on magnetoelectric coupling in charge-neutral quasiparticles"

The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir\\'e superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir\\'e-pocket to intra-moir\\'e-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moir\\'e exciton and a stabilization of moir\\'e trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moir\\'e pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moir\\'e trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles."

To better understand the many-body normal state from which superconductivity arises, it is important to ascertain the nature and role of correlations in its electronic structure. To provide insights into this question, we use a fully charge self-consistent DFT+e-DMFT (eDMFT) approach to study La327 at several compressive strain levels. At the strain level where superconductivity has been observed experimentally (-2\\%), in contrast with DFT and DFT+$U$ results, the so-called $\\gamma$ pocket emerges and the associated band, of mostly $d_{z^2}$ character, crosses the Fermi level exhibiting `flat band''-like features when dynamical correlations are included. Larger strain levels suppress the $\\gamma$ pocket, which may have implications for superconductivity or its pairing symmetry."

      "summary": "Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure, which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4. Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity."

      "summary": "Carbon Nanotubes have shown to be an attractive option in the race to find a replacement to silicon-based transistors, due to its high electrical conductivity, extraordinary mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. However, challenges with regards to controlling the purity and chirality of CNTs have raised doubts if the mass production of these transistors are even viable. This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and potassium doping were studied and analyzed. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive guide to allow for the mass production and rapid integration of CNT transistors into the semi-conductor market."

      "summary": "Deorbitalization of a conventional meta-generalized-gradient exchange-correlation approximation replaces its dependence upon the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density with a dependence on the density gradient and Laplacian. In principle, that simplification should provide improved computational performance relative to the original meta-GGA form because of the shift from an orbital-dependent generalized Kohn-Sham potential to a true KS local potential. Often that prospective gain is lost because of problematic roughness in the density caused by the density Laplacian and consequent roughness in the exchange-correlation potential from the resulting higher-order spatial derivatives of the density in it. We address the problem by constructing a deorbitalizer based on the RPP deorbitalizer [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 083803 (2022)] with comparative smoothness of the potential along with retention of constraint satisfaction as design goals. Applied to the r^2SCAN exchange-correlation functional [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 8208 (2020)], we find substantial timing improvements for solid-state calculations over both r^2SCAN and its earlier deorbitalization for high precision calculations of structural properties, while improving upon the accuracy of RPP deorbitalization for both solids and molecules."

Among available codes, the \\textsc{BoltzTraP} code is the most widely adopted, but many recent studies contain systematic mistakes. We identify three error modes: (1) inserting the electronic thermal conductivity at zero electric field, $\\kappa_0$, in place of the electronic thermal conductivity at zero electric current, $\\kappa_e$, (2) computing the figure of merit $zT$ by combining a constant relaxation time of unity while keeping the lattice thermal conductivity $\\kappa_\\ell$ in standard units, and (3) doing both errors at once. We have found many examples of the third error, but since the first two are simpler, we suspect they are also present in the literature. For the single parabolic band model, we derive exact analytical limits in the non-degenerate and near-degenerate regimes, and we show how mistakes appear for the realistic case study of ZrNiSn. Our results illustrate how faulty calculations can appear reasonable at certain temperatures and Fermi levels, and we provide practical guidance for identifying faulty results and avoiding such pitfalls in thermoelectric transport studies."

Here, we calculate the current in such junctions using a Lindblad formalism within the Markovian approximation. We consider transport in the Coulomb blockade regime with spin-polarized leads and a magnetic field smaller than the coercive field of either lead. Dependences on magnetic field and lead spin polarization of the spin blockade, decoherence, and spin lifetime of the subsystems of this model are calculated."

      "summary": "Noisy pursuit in complex environments drives emergent collective behaviors in active matter systems. A compelling platform to study the impact of environment cues is provided by the standard Vicsek model for studying flocking and swarming phenomena. In this study, we explore the collective dynamics of Vicsek agents in a complex noise environment, featuring a noiseless circular region ($\\eta_{\\text{c}} = 0.0$) surrounded by a noisy outer region ($\\eta_{\\text{b}} = 1.0$, tunable), with a mutually repelling interactions. By varying the outer noise intensity, we observe an emergent rotational order ($\\phi_r$) that peaks at higher noise levels ($\\eta_{\\text{b}}\\sim 1$), as revealed by phase and susceptibility plots. Global order follows ($\\phi$) follows a `U' shaped curve, $\\phi \\sim 0.965$ at $\\eta_b=0$, dies down to $\\phi \\sim 0.57$ at $\\eta_b=0.9$ and re-enters at $\\eta_b > 1$ and peaks $\\phi \\sim 0.960$ at $\\eta_b=1.5$. The latter rise attributing to $\\phi_r$ increase. Higher particle velocities enhance escape rates ($\\kappa$) from the circular region, with slower-moving agents exhibiting greater virtual confinement. We quantify escape dynamics through time-averaged and first-passage escape rates, demonstrating velocity-dependent retention on the probability of finding the bi-motility agent flocks at a give time resulting in segregation and trapping. Introducing a gradual noise increase from the circle's center to the outer region reduces both global ($\\phi$) and rotational ($\\phi_r$) order, underscoring the impact of environmental heterogeneity and sudden annealing over gradual change. These findings offer insights into predicting and manipulating active agent dynamics in heterogeneous environments, with applications in biological and synthetic swarming systems."

      "summary": "Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy-efficient and climate-friendly alternative to traditional vapor-compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials were minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit-cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3/Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. Our approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions."

Building on previous research, here we introduce GaP quantum dots as an heterophase into the B(P)SCCO superconductor, aiming to enhance its superconductivity through the luminescent properties of GaP quantum dots. The experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of GaP quantum dots into B(P)SCCO generates significant tunable superconducting effects, leading to enhanced critical transition temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc), and Meissner field (Hc) of B(P)SCCO with increasing luminescent intensity of the GaP quantum dots. The enhancement effect induced by GaP quantum dots exhibits a positive correlation with luminescent intensity, meaning samples with the addition of GaP quantum dots exhibiting higher luminescent intensity show elevated Tc, Jc, and Hc values. Unlike impurity effects, a distinct critical concentration dependency is observed. Notably, this GaP quantum dot modification strategy is not only effective in conventional superconductors but also applicable to high-temperature oxide superconductors."

By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems."

In order to analyze the inhomogeneous system we employ real-space bosonic dynamical mean-field theory and perform an ensemble average over disorder realizations. To distinguish the MI from the BG phase, we compare the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the compressibility with the energy gap condition. To identify the insulator to SF transition, we apply a percolation analysis to the condensate order parameter. In qualitative accordance with the theorem of inclusions we always find an intermediate BG phase between the SF and MI. However, the quantitative comparison indicates significant deviations between the MI to BG phase boundary expected in the thermodynamic limit and the one obtained for a finite system size. Analyzing the spectral function in the strong-coupling regime reveals evidence for analytically predicted damped localized modes in the dispersion relation."

      "summary": "Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors represent a significant class of narrow band red-emitting materials, whose luminescent properties are profoundly influenced by electron-phonon coupling. However, the parity-forbidden nature of these electronic transition systems is incompatible with the conventional Condon approximation, which is widely adopted in the classic theories such as the Huang-Rhys theory, a framework established on the assumption of parity-allowed electric dipole transitions. This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding the principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic transitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent intensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly suppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To elucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden systems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment of the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers the physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order sidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is derived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2). This work not only reveals new findings regarding the phonon sidebands of the parity-forbidden electronic transition systems, but also establishes an improved theoretical framework for understanding the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms of color centers in solids."

Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \\to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \\dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity."

We compared these results with the results obtained under the assumption of conventional band transport, small polaron hopping and polaron band transport. From this comparison we identified the regions in parameter space where each of these transport regimes is valid. In some cases when imaginary-time comparison of current-current correlation functions could not give conclusive results, we complemented them with real-time comparisons or the comparison with literature data on numerically exact dc mobilities.

      "summary": "Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser."

By varying the volume fraction of the RBC (hematocrit) and aggregation strength, we reveal a surprising phase separation: a dense RBC core surrounded by a cell-free layer, an effect not previously reported in whole blood studies. This separation is shown to be more pronounced with rigidified cells and persists even at high hematocrit levels, unlike in healthy samples. By connecting RBC deformability and aggregability to pore-mediated phase dynamics, our study provides a foundation for new diagnostic tools capable of classifying blood disorders or evaluating blood quality using only a sheet of structured paper, seamlessly integrating fundamental fluid mechanics with translational biomedical innovation in a previously unexplored manner."

Minimizing two-level system (TLS) losses, particularly at material interfaces, is critical for gatemon and topological qubits operating at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields. NbTi, a superconducting alloy with a high upper critical field, enables SCPW resonators resilient to such conditions. We fabricated NbTi SCPW resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates and systematically characterized their TLS-limited quality factors as functions of temperature and microwave photon number. Our results demonstrate that NbTi-based SCPWs on Si/SiO2 substrates provide a promising platform for developing next-generation quantum circuits."

      "summary": "Relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit exceptional dielectric and electromechanical properties, yet their microscopic origins remain elusive due to the interplay of hierarchical polar structures and chemical complexity. While models based on polar nanoregions or nanodomains offer valuable phenomenological insights, they often lack the first-principles predictive capability necessary for quantitatively describing functional properties such as piezoelectric coefficients. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, enabled by a universal first-principles-based machine-learning interatomic potential, to investigate atomic-scale polar dynamics in canonical Pb-, Bi-, and Ba-based relaxors. Across all systems, we uncover a universal dipolar nematic state, characterized by long-range orientational order of local polarizations without local alignment, challenging conventional polar cluster-based paradigms. We introduce a universal order parameter, derived from the skewness of the distributions of the local polarization autocorrelation functions, that captures the thermal evolution of both lead-based and lead-free systems within a single master curve. This nematic order, and its robust structural memory under electric field cycling, underpins key relaxor phenomena, including diffuse phase transition, frequency-dependent dielectric dispersion, and reversible giant piezoelectricity. Our findings establish a unified microscopic framework for relaxors and present a broadly applicable statistical approach to understanding complex disordered materials."

While the kagome lattice has been extensively studied and the snub square lattice has served as a quasicrystal approximant, the broader family remains comparatively unexplored in the context of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, incorporating both $s$ and $p$ orbitals. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and they give rise to sizable spin Hall currents."

Our results show that the polarized phonons within the sample substrate induce robust, helicity-defined magnetization reversal in the magnetic overlayer. Moreover, the quality of switching remains largely unaffected when the degree of ellipticity of the infrared excitation is varied at frequencies resonant with the targeted phonon modes. Conversely, as the excitation is moved slightly off-resonance, switching quality becomes highly sensitive to the ellipticity of the incident light."

Established approaches, including rapidly rotating gases and tight-binding lattices, are often hampered by low interaction energies and small many-body energy gaps. While optical flux lattices (OFLs) can achieve higher effective magnetic flux densities, standard two-state configurations generate highly non-uniform fields, and extensions to multi-state systems introduce significant experimental complexity. Here, we present a new paradigm for engineering robust FQH phases in OFLs using only two internal atomic states. We show that the introduction of an additional scalar potential provides a generic mechanism for creating Chern bands that are simultaneously essentially flat and \"ideal.\" Drawing on concepts from moir\\'e materials, these desirable properties arise by tuning lattice parameters to certain $N$-flat manifolds $(N=1,2,\\dots)$, where the $1$-flat manifold shares its origin with certain \"magic-angle\" conditions. We provide a variety of examples of how to design optical flux lattices, including dark-state OFLs, to achieve these goals. This method allows for precise tuning of band flatness and stabilizes both Abelian and non-Abelian FQH phases. Our scheme is compatible with existing experimental capabilities using vector polarizability, opening practical routes to exploring strongly correlated topological physics with cold atoms."

One such example is the Blume-Capel model, a three-state spin model, whose phase diagram features a tricritical point where second-order and first-order transition lines converge, leading to a coexistence of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases. Here, we realize an artificial crystal of single-domain nanomagnets, placed on the links of the Ruby lattice, enabling real-space observation of the Blume-Capel degrees of freedom. These Blume-Capel degrees of freedom are represented by the presence, sign and interactions of the toroidal moments that emerge naturally in plaquettes of nanomagnets in the Ruby artificial spin ice. By precisely tuning the lattice parameters of the Ruby artificial spin ice, we demonstrate control over the two-step ordering process of the toroidal moments, whereby there is a high-temperature crossover from a paramagnetic phase to an intermediate paratoroidic regime, followed by a second-order phase transition to a ferrotoroidic ground state. This sequence of toroidal phases and transitions is accurately captured by the Blume-Capel framework and provides a direct realization of a substantial portion of the phase diagram associated with the model. This establishes a new platform for exploring exotic Hamiltonians in terms of artificial spin ice superstructures, here with groups of nanomagnets forming toroidal moments. The success of this mapping paves the way for an entirely new frontier in artificial spin ice: intentionally engineering lattice designs whose effective Hamiltonians mediate unconventional forms of magnetic order, with new behaviors and functionalities."

We argue that the sorting results from gradients in the nematic order, and show that the behaviour can be driven by either imposed boundary anchoring or spontaneous anchoring induced by active flows. Our results can be tested by experiments on microtubule-kinesin motor networks, and may be relevant to sorting to the boundary in cell colonies or cancer spheroids."

      "summary": "The early prediction of tipping points, distinguished by sudden and catastrophic shifts from stable states, poses a challenging task that would enable us to assess the impending threat across natural and engineered systems. This threat becomes particularly acute in low-fluctuation environments, where tipping occurs through saddle-node bifurcation without prior warning in noise dynamics. In this study, we investigate the tipping point dynamics of avalanche catastrophes in low-fluctuation domain, employing model system like the zero temperature random field Ising model and thermally deposited cobalt films. As the system approaches the tipping point, avalanche activity reveals pronounced critical behaviour, including critical slowing down, variance enhancement, and a growing spatial correlation length--hallmarks that may serve as early warning signals of impending collapse. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing disorder in the system reduces its vulnerability to catastrophic failure. In highly disorder regimes, these early warning signals emerge well before the transition, thereby providing a large margin for anticipation and mitigation. This key finding suggests a protective role of disorder offering a novel perspective on resilience in complex systems. Our results not only deepen the understanding of tipping phenomena in disorder materials but also have broader implications for forecasting regime shift in diverse real-world systems."

Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect."

Here we formulate this mapping through a nonlinear coordinate transformation that accurately connects tight-binding degrees of freedom to metamaterial excitations in the nonlinear regime. This transformation allows us to design information-processing metamaterials across the broad range of computations that can be expressed as tight-binding models, a capability we showcase with three examples based on three different computing paradigms: a coherent Ising machine that approximates combinatorial optimization problems through energy minimization, a mechanical racetrack memory exemplifying in-memory computing, and a speech classification metamaterial based on analog neuromorphic computing."

In this work, we have integrated first-principles density functional theory with VQE and VQD algorithms and utilizing the Wannier Tight-Binding Hamiltonian (WTBH) method to predict the electronic characteristics of solids. We demonstrate that VQE and VQD algorithms can be used to accurately predict electronic characteristics in a variety of multi-component prototype solid-state materials such as-Silicon (semiconductor), Gold (metallic), Boron Nitrile (insulator), Graphene (semi-metal). Efficient SU2 performs well among all the predefined ansatz used in the study. COBYLA is the fastest optimizer among the classical optimizers with minimum number of iterations for convergence. Results of noise models help to understand the band structure when calculated on real quantum hardware. As quantum hardware advances, our method stands as a prototype for future quantum simulations of materials pushing us closer to autonomous quantum discovery engines."

      "summary": "Multistable order parameters provide a natural means of encoding non-volatile information in spatial domains, a concept that forms the foundation of magnetic memory devices. However, this stability inherently conflicts with the need to move information around the device for processing and readout. While in magnetic systems, domains can be transported using currents or external fields, mechanisms to robustly shuttle information-bearing domains across neutral systems are scarce. Here, we experimentally realize a topological boundary ratchet in an elastic metamaterial, where digital information is encoded in buckling domains and transported in a quantized manner via cyclic loading. The transport is topological in origin: neighboring domains act as different topological pumps for their Bogoliubov excitations, so their interface hosts topological boundary modes. Cyclic loading renders these modes unstable through inter-domain pressure, which in turn drives the motion of the domain wall. We demonstrate that the direction of information propagation can be controlled through adjustable mechanical constraints on the buckling beams, and numerically investigate buckling-based domain-wall logic circuits in an elastic metamaterial network. The underlying tight-binding structure with low-order nonlinearities makes this approach a general pathway toward racetrack memories in neutral systems."

      "summary": "The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a manifestation of broken centrosymmetry, has attracted interest as a probe of the symmetry and quantum geometry of materials, and for use in novel optoelectronic devices. Despite its bulk nature, the BPVE is typically measured with interfaces and metal contacts, raising concerns as to whether the observed signals are genuinely of bulk origin. Here, we use a contactless pump-probe microscopy method to observe the space- and time-resolved dynamics of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal, monodomain $BiFeO_{3}$. We observe asymmetric transport of carriers along the polar axis, confirming the intrinsic bulk and symmetry-driven nature of BPVE. This asymmetric transport persists for several nanoseconds after photoexcitation, which cannot be explained by the shift or phonon ballistic current BPVE mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations show that asymmetric momentum scattering by defects under non-equilibrium conditions explains the long-lived carrier drift, while first principles calculations confirm that oxygen vacancies have an asymmetric electronic state that can cause such asymmetric scattering. Our findings highlight the critical role of defects in long-lived photoresponses."

      "summary": "In many materials, ordered phases and their order parameters are easily characterized by standard experimental methods. \"Hidden order\" refers to a phase transition in which an ordered state emerges without such an easily detectable order parameter, despite clear thermodynamic evidence of the transition. The underlying mechanisms for these unconventional states of matter stem from spin-orbit coupling, which intertwines inter-site exchange, classical electron-magnetic interactions, and electron-lattice effects. This physics is elusive to experimental probes and beyond traditional theories of insulating magnetism, requiring sophisticated methodologies for its exploration. In this Review, we survey exotic hidden-order phases in correlated insulators, particularly focusing on the latest progress in material-specific theories and numerical approaches. The relevant degrees of freedom in these phases are local high-rank multipole moments of magnetic and charge density that emerge from spin-orbit entangled correlated shells of heavy d and f electron ions and interact on the lattice via various mechanisms. We discuss approaches to modelling hidden orders in realistic systems via direct ab initio calculations or by constructing low-energy many-body effective Hamiltonian. We also describe how these new theoretical tools have helped to uncover driving mechanisms for recently discovered multipolar phases in double perovskites of heavy transition metals, and how they have proved instrumental in disentangling the role of various interactions in \"traditional\" f-electron multipolar materials like actinide dioxides. In both cases, material-specific theories have played a key role in interpreting and predicting experimental signatures of hidden orders."

      "summary": "Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as $1/\\tau$ or slower, where $\\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting."

A symmetry-enforced interband (time-reversal even) torque persists inside the bulk gap and deterministically reverses the N\\'eel order and layer-resolved Chern number without free carriers. Upon doping, both interband and intraband torques are amplified, lowering the critical electric field for switching by two orders of magnitude. Together, these results establish two complementary regimes of control, dissipationless in-gap torques without Joule heating and enhanced current-induced torques, providing a robust route to manipulate local Chern numbers, quasi-helical edge states, and topological responses in antiferromagnetic topological insulators."

Step edges are resolved when supported by optical contrast, while spurious features such as dust and background texture are reliably rejected. Each identified flake is exported in a structured format that includes centroid coordinates, bounding geometries, average RGB color, and estimated optical thickness, enabling seamless integration into automated pick-up and stacking workflows. The pipeline is hardware-light and operates without the need for deep learning models or nanoscale ground-truth labels, making it practical for scalable front-end wafer processing at a hardware cost of under 30,000 USD. In contrast to prior approaches that focus solely on detection accuracy, the proposed system unifies flake segmentation with indexing, filtering, and blueprint-driven stacking, forming a closed-loop workflow from image acquisition to device planning.

By continuously varying the deformation parameter, the simulations reveal that true stress and rupture characteristics, such as strain and stress at break and work for rupture, systematically decrease as the boundary condition approaches cross-sectional area conservation. In contrast, nominal stress and the corresponding rupture characteristics exhibit near-independence from boundary conditions, indicating that bond tension remains largely unaffected for phantom networks under the examined conditions. These results clarify that volume expansion primarily drives deviations in true stress and highlight a critical distinction between true and nominal stress-strain definitions. The difference between true and nominal stress-strain relations also affected the scaling exponent for strand length dependence on stretch at break. The findings stress the importance of specifying both deformation boundary conditions and stress-strain definitions in polymer network simulations for accurate interpretation of mechanical properties."

      "summary": "Spin wave and magnetic domain wall are two of basic excitations in magnetic systems, and their spatiotemporal interplay encodes rich information of underlying magnetic interactions. In synthetic antiferromagnets, the domain wall acquires an inertia and the spin wave unlocks the full polarization degree of freedom, lays a salient platform for their interplay. Here we show that both the translational and angular velocities of domain wall in synthetic antiferromagnets can be detected via the scattered spin wave, through the synergy of translational and angular Doppler effects. Following the setup of an electromagnetic or acoustic radar, the time evolution of a domain wall state are accessible via a series of spin wave packets, in both non-invasive and invasive fashion. The inspections in frequency domain, offer new paradigms in exploration and exploitation of magnetic excitations."

In the graphite-rich region, three characteristic Raman features-the $E_{2g}^{(1)}$ shear mode, the G band ($E_{2g}^{(2)}$), and the 2D band-were observed and tracked as a function of pressure. The G band exhibits a pronounced blue shift with increasing pressure, indicating enhanced interlayer coupling between graphite planes. In the water-rich region, the librational band and three distinct O-H stretching modes were identified. Notably, above 8 GPa, the slope of the pressure dependence decreases relative to the earlier report, likely due to the influence of the water pressure medium, emphasizing the need for further investigation at higher pressures."

Most HS materials exhibit back-stress strengthening, as is typical for all plastically non-homogeneous materials. To better embody the distinctiveness of materials crafted via innovative heterostructuring, here we introduce the concept of \"structural gradient hardening\" (SGH), which captures an essential feature of HS materials and complements traditional strengthening mechanisms. SGH refers to the extra strengthening that arises from a characteristic gradient structure introduced by heterostructuring, beyond what is predicted by the rule of mixtures. This distinction is useful, as the overall back stress can in fact be partitioned into Type I and Type II components, with the latter specifically quantifying the extra hardening originating from the structural and strain gradients established by heterostructuring, as articulated in this Viewpoint article."

We show how the spectrum can be understood from a perturbative solution of the exact transcendental equation in the weak and strong-coupling regimes. We additionally provide expressions for normalized wavefunctions and different overlaps between the states in the presence and absence of the impurity.

Oxidation parameters such as temperature, time and nitrogen purging rate are first optimized for obtaining high quality undoped VO2 thin film. Insulator-to-metal (IMT) phase transition behavior of VO2 thin films fabricated in a low-O2 environment is characterized with temperature dependent spectral infrared transmittance and electrical resistivity measurements, where there is 15% higher infrared transmittance change and additional 1 order change in resistivity in comparison with VO2 thin films fabricated in a O2-rich environment. Grazing angle X-ray diffraction scan confirms no presence of higher oxides in the VO2 oxidized in low-O2 environment, which improves its quality significantly. Comprehensive studies on thermal annealing and vacuum reduction for tungsten doped VO2 thin films are also carried out to find the optimal fabrication conditions. With the tungsten at. % measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the optimal WVO2 thin films fabricated through this streamlined oxidation, annealing and reduction processes in extremely low-O2 furnace environment exhibit lowered IMT temperature at -23{\\deg}C per at.% of tungsten dopants from 68{\\deg}C without doping. This low-cost and scalable fabrication method could facilitate the wide development of tunable WVO2 coatings in thermal and energy applications."

This intrinsic NVNE has a quantum origin from the quantum metric and shows independence from the relaxation time. It's found that the local largest symmetry near the valleys for the nonvanishing intrinsic NVNE is a single mirror symmetry in two-dimensional systems. We theoretically investigate the intrinsic NVNE in the uniaxially strained gapless bilayer graphene and find the intrinsic NVNE can emerge when applying the temperature gradient vertically to the direction of strain. Interestingly, a transition from the compressive strain to the tensile one results in the sign reversal of the intrinsic NVNE."

      "summary": "Time-reversal symmetry plays an essential role in the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which bound the fluctuations of observables in terms of the associated dissipation. In fact, thermodynamic uncertainty relations are typically derived under the assumption that the observable of interest is antisymmetric under time reversal. This also suggests that existing thermodynamic uncertainty relations are restricted to a limited class of observables. In this paper, we mitigate this restriction by introducing a new class of observables that do not exhibit the exact antisymmetry but only change the sign under time reversal. We call it generalized time reversal and derive a broadly applicable thermodynamic uncertainty relation for observables with this condition. The generalization is achieved by direct statistical arguments on the probability distributions of dissipation and the observable, and holds for both deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the derived thermodynamic uncertainty relation in a quantum refrigeration model, showing that the precision of generalized observables remains expressible in terms of the heat-dissipation cost. The result extends the scope of thermodynamic uncertainty relations beyond what was reached by frameworks relying on strong symmetries imposed by fluctuation theorems."

Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure composed of the room-temperature ferromagnet $\\text{Fe}_3\\text{Ga}\\text{Te}_2$ and the ferroelectric $\\text{In}_2\\text{Se}_3$.

The enhancement of PMA arises from interfacial hybridization that modifies the spin-orbit coupling of Fe $d$-orbitals. Our results demonstrate an effective pathway to engineer magnetoelectric coupling in two-dimensional multiferroic heterostructures and pave the way toward energy-efficient spintronic devices."

The chain collapse is driven by nonlocal dipolar interactions and anisotropic polarization of monomers, a characteristic of real polymers that prior theories were unable to incorporate. Once collapsed, a large number of chain monomers accumulate at the center location between the chain ends, locally increasing the electric field and polarization by orders of magnitude. The chain collapse is sensitive to the orientation of the applied electric field and chain stretch. Our findings not only offer new ways for rapid actuation and sensing but also provide a pathway to discover the critical physics behind instabilities and electrical breakdown in dielectric polymers."

These characteristics make them highly suitable for applications in aerospace, new energy vehicles, and portable electronic devices. However, the growth of lithium dendrite at the electrode/electrolyte interface remains a critical challenge, limiting both performance and safety. The growth of lithium dendrites in the electrolyte not only reduces the Coulombic efficiency of the battery but also poses a risk of puncturing the electrolyte, leading to internal short circuits between the anode and cathode. This study is to solve the problem of lithium dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries by employing phase-field theory for numerical simulations. A phase-field model is developed by coupling the mechanical stress field, thermal field, and electrochemical field, to investigate the morphology and evolution of lithium dendrites under the condition of different ambient temperatures, external pressures, and their combined effects. The results indicate that higher temperature and greater external pressure significantly suppress lithium dendrite growth, leading to fewer side branches, smoother surfaces, and more uniform electrochemical deposition. Increased external pressure inhibits longitudinal dendrite growth, resulting in a compressed morphology with higher compactness, but at the cost of increased mechanical instability. The combined effect of temperature and pressure exhibits a pronounced inhibitory influence on dendrite growth, with stress concentrating at the dendrite roots. This stress distribution promotes lateral growth, facilitating the formation of flatter and denser lithium deposits."

      "summary": "Superconductivity, characterized by dissipationless current flow with flux expulsion or quantization, is usually muted when the magnetic field or the temperature is sufficiently high. However, in rare instances, superconductivity can reappear upon increasing the temperature or magnetic field, a phenomenon known as reentrant superconductivity. It usually emerges from competing orders in strongly correlated materials. Here we demonstrate reentrant superconductivity as a function of both temperature and magnetic field, tuned by radio frequency (RF) power in a relatively simple system: granular aluminum (grAl), which exhibits the properties of a naturally occurring Josephson junction array. At low temperatures, giant Shapiro steps emerge, exhibiting characteristics of a single Josephson junction. Coherent phase locking across the array's multiple junctions amplifies the quantized voltage, enabling tunability at radio frequencies, as observed in artificially designed Josephson arrays. We show that our system can be tuned from a coherent superconducting (stiff-phase) to an insulating (phase-fluctuating) state using RF power. We propose that the RF power modulates the Josephson coupling energy, $E_J$. Remarkably, at elevated temperatures, the screening of the electron charge suppresses the charging energy, causing superconductivity to reappear. This many-body effect cannot be described within a single junction framework and involves many-body correlations. Our system can therefore be tuned to observe both the single-junction regime and many-body correlation effects, serving as a quantum simulator for complex phenomena in condensed matter physics."

NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate successfully in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose strategies for further improvements."

      "summary": "Quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, in contrast to their periodic counterparts, lack strict periodicity which gives rise to complex and localised spin wave spectra characterized by numerous band gaps and fractal features. Despite their intrinsic structural complexity, quasiperiodic nature of these magnonic crystals enables better tunability of spin wave spectra over their periodic counterparts and therefore holds promise for the applications in reprogrammable magnonic devices. In this article, we provide an overview of magnetization reversal and precessional magnetization dynamics studied so far in various quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, illustrating how their quasiperiodic nature gives rise to tailored band structure, enabling unparalleled control over spin waves. The review is concluded by highlighting the possible potential applications of these quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, exploring potential avenues for future exploration followed by a brief summary."

      "summary": "Recent progress has enabled the controlled fabrication of domain walls (DWs) in graphene, which host topological kink states. Meanwhile, reliable techniques for constructing graphene-based Joseph- son junctions have been established. While the experimental prerequisites for combining DWs with Josephson junctions are now available, this direction remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate transport properties in graphene-based Josephson junctions mediated by topological kink states and propose three DW engineering strategies. (i) DW number engineering uncovers a continuous evolution of critical current interference pattern from Aharonov-Bohm oscil- lation to Fraunhofer diffraction with increasing DW number, reproducing experimental observations [Barrier et al., Nature 628, 741 (2024)] and suggesting enhanced sensitivity for magnetometry ap- plications. (ii) DW symmetry engineering demonstrates that an asymmetric configuration of DWs under magnetic field yields an ideal Josephson diode characterized by pronounced nonreciprocal transport. (iii) DW geometry engineering reveals that intersecting DWs enable controllable super- current splitting with ratios among leads tunable through the intersection angle, magnetic field, and superconducting phase difference. Our findings elucidate the rich physics of DW-based Josephson junctions and establish a versatile platform for next-generation quantum devices."

At the buried thermal-oxide SiO$_{2}$ interface, the valley splitting increases as a function of the electrostatic bias $\\delta n = n_{B}-n_{F}$ (where $n_{B}$ and $n_{F}$ are electron densities contributed by back and front gates, respectively) and reaches values as high as $6.3$~meV, independent of the total carrier concentration of the channel. We show that $\\delta n$ tunes the square of the wave function modulus at the interface and its penetration into the barrier, both of which are key quantities in a theory describing interface-induced valley splitting, and is therefore the natural experimental parameter to manipulate valleys in 2D silicon systems. At the front interface, made of a thin ``high-k'' dielectric, a smaller valley splitting is observed, adding further options to tune the valley splitting within a single device."

(2) A gapless phase (Goldstone) mode and a gapped amplitude mode, associated with the fluctuations of EI order parameter, couple to the layer antisymmetric gauge field. In the long-wavelength limit, the Goldstone mode exhibits linear dispersion with velocity inversely proportional to the square root of exciton compressibility, representing the first sound mode of the exciton condensate Significantly, its linear dispersion yields a cubic frequency dependence of the real admittance in microwave impedance microscopy (MIM), providing a method to detect the Goldstone mode directly."

      "summary": "Although the generic mechanism behind high-temperature superconductivity remains notoriously elusive, a set of favorable conditions for its occurrence in a given material has emerged: (i) the electronic structure should have a very high density of states near the Fermi level; (ii) electrons need to be susceptible to a sizable interaction with another degree of freedom to ensure pairing themselves; (iii) the ability to fine-tune some of the system properties significantly helps maximising the critical temperature. Here, by means of high-resolution ARPES, we show that all three criteria are remarkably fulfilled in trigonal platinum bismuthide (t-PtBi$_2$). Specifically, this happens on its surface, which hosts topological surface states known as Fermi arcs. Our findings pave the way for the stabilisation and optimisation of high-temperature superconductivity in this topological material."

      "summary": "Cement paste serves as the universal binder in concrete, formed by mixing water with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). In its fresh state, cement paste is a suspension in which the initial particle inventory continuously dissolves, while simultaneously, a growing population of colloidal calcium silica-hydrate (C-S-H) particles forms and progressively builds a percolated structure that densifies and hardens through hydration. Like most colloidal gels, cement paste is sensitive to external stimuli such as mechanical vibrations and temperature variations. Here, we show that power ultrasound (PUS) applied to OPC paste during the very early stages of hydration significantly alters the mechanical properties of the hardened material. Freshly prepared cement pastes are exposed to PUS at varying durations and intensities before curing for 28 days. Micro-indentation testing at the scale of tens of microns reveals that increasing PUS amplitude and prolonged PUS exposure degrade the micro-mechanical properties of hardened cement paste, making it more ductile. This softening behavior evolves continuously with exposure conditions and is consistent with an increase in porosity, likely caused by micro-cracks induced by PUS. This scenario is further supported by micro-scratch testing, which shows higher levels of acoustic emission in PUS-exposed samples. Finally, nano-indentation confirms that the properties of the individual phases composing the hardened paste -- low-density and high-density C-S-H -- remain largely unaffected. These findings offer valuable experimental insights into novel pathways for modifying the mechanical properties of reactive colloidal gels."

      "summary": "Lipid vesicles consist of aqueous cores surrounded by a bilayer of phospholipids. Hybrid polymer-lipid vesicles incorporate both polymers and lipids, offering promising properties for developing pharmaceuticals, biosensors, and artificial cells. The hybrid vesicles can be symmetric, in which their two leaflets contain identical compositions, or asymmetric, in which the leaflets possess dissimilar compositions and can lead to dramatically modified properties. However, methods to produce both symmetric and asymmetric hybrid vesicles result in heterogenous compositions and sizes, making it challenging to quantify the effect of asymmetry and limiting applications. Here, we use a microfluidic approach to produce hybrid vesicles containing symmetric or asymmetric leaflets with precisely engineered compositions. We find the vesicles with asymmetric leaflets are significantly stiffer and tougher than those with symmetric leaflets; moreover, the lateral diffusivity of lipids is greatly decreased. The structure for improved toughness consists of an inner leaflet that is a stretchable lipid leaflet and an outer leaflet that is a fully continuous polymer leaflet. This technique of precisely engineering asymmetric structures may be applied to hybrid vesicles composed of block copolymers and phospholipids dissolvable in chloroform and hexane, further expanding their applications."

Out of the entire set, 31 compounds satisfy all criteria for energetic, dynamic, mechanical, and thermal stability. Our analysis reveals several key trends: halide-containing systems exhibit the highest average magnetic moments and the highest magnetic transition temperatures, highlighting their potential for room-temperature spintronic applications. The majority of stable compounds display perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), with Fe$_3$SiTe$_2$ exhibiting the strongest PMA among all candidates. Exchange interactions are found to be governed by a dual mechanism, direct exchange between nearest-neighbor Fe atoms and indirect, $p$-orbital-mediated exchange for second-nearest neighbors and beyond. Notably, four compounds have non-centrosymmetric crystal structures and exhibit finite spiralization constants. Among them, Fe$_3$AsBr$_2$ is predicted to host N\\'eel-type skyrmions even at zero external magnetic field, as confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. These findings offer a roadmap for experimental realization of novel 2D ferromagnets with enhanced functionalities."

The near-edge region is accurately captured using an efficient implementation of time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory applied to core excitations, while ab initio molecular dynamics provides essential sampling of core-excitation energies and interatomic distance distributions for interpreting extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) features. Owing to the efficiency of the approach, the total spectrum can be decomposed into contributions from bulk, defective, and surface environments, which commonly coexist in experimental systems. The methodology is demonstrated for sodium at the Na K-edge in NaCl, where the predicted spectra show good agreement with experimental measurements on thin film samples. This strategy offers a practical route to generating chemically specific XAFS cross-section data for elements and species that remain challenging to characterize experimentally, thereby enabling deeper insights into materials of technological importance."

At half filling of the lowest Landau level, it has been predicted that ``composite fermions'' -- emergent quasiparticle of an electron with two magnetic flux quanta -- can experience zero net magnetic field and form a Fermi sea, dubbed composite Fermi liquid (CFL). However, the seemingly simple appearance of CFL is a strongly correlated quantum many-body state in disguise, and to solve it in a controlled manner is extremely difficult, to the level that the thermodynamic properties of CFL is still largely unknown. In this work, we perform state-of-the-art thermal tensor network simulations on the $\\nu=1/2$ Landau level systems, and observe low-temperature power-law behaviour of the specific heat, signaling the gapless nature of CFL. More importantly, the power is extracted to be closed to $2/3$, clearly deviated from the ordinary linear-$T$ Fermi liquid behaviour, suggesting the coupling between the CFs and the dynamical emergent gauge field and therefore revealed the quantum many-body aspect of the CFL state. Relevance of our methodology to other quantum Hall settings and moir\\'e systems is discussed."

However, the intricate viscoelastic response of hydrogels remains challenging to capture using conventional phenomenological models. In this study, we prepared a series of tough dual crosslinked hydrogels -- poly(methacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)-Fe3+ and systematically tuned their mechanical properties by leveraging the salting-out effect. The viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels was characterized under shear deformations, and a four-parameter Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) was constructed to quantitatively describe oscillatory shear, creep, and stress relaxation responses. The influence of salt concentration on each FMM parameter was analyzed and correlated with bulk mechanical performance. This framework provides a first step toward capturing the complex viscoelastic nature of the advanced hydrogels and lays the foundation for developing more comprehensive nonlinear constitutive models."

      "summary": "Oxygen vacancies are often essential for stabilizing the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase in HfO$_2$, with cationic doping widely employed to introduce such defects. In contrast, systematic studies on anionic doping to induce ferroelectricity remain largely in nascent stages. On epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ grown on ITO buffered YSZ substrates that crystallize in a mixed monoclinic (non-polar) and orthorhombic (polar) phases, we introduce nitrogen doping via post deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N$_2$ atmosphere at 900~$^\\circ$C. As the annealing time increases from 10s to 4min, the monoclinic phase fraction diminishes, enabling the emergence of well-defined ferroelectric loops in films annealed beyond 2~min. We clearly show that this is an effect of nitrogen incorporation (doping) into the samples through a suite of structure-property correlation measurements including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results reveal that nitrogen actively participates in the RTA-induced phase stabilization, enabling ferroelectricity in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ without sacrificing crystallographic coherence, providing a viable pathway for structure-property correlation studies and a model system to study opto-electronic devices integrated with ferroelectrics."

This technique offers unprecedented spatial resolution, operates under ambient condition, and provides quantitative stray field measurements, making it uniquely suited for studying nanoscale magnetic textures. Our approach combines fluorescence quenching imaging and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cODMR). A comparison of the two ASI samples, which differ in their lattice constants of 1000 nm and 910 nm respectively, reveals differences in the appearance of ice-rule violations - deviations from the lowest energy configuration in ASI vertices. We attribute these variations to varying coupling strengths dictated by the lattice constant. From the cODMR data, we extract both axial and transverse components of the local magnetic field relative to the NV axis. Micromagnetic modeling of these measurements allows for an iterative determination of the external magnetic field orientation, the detection of subtle magnetization tilts induced by weak external fields (well below the nanomagnets' switching threshold), and an estimation of the effective saturation magnetization, thereby accounting for deviations in nanomagnet dimensions. These findings provide crucial insights into the tunable magnetic interactions in ASI, paving the way for the design of advanced magnonic and spintronic devices."

Odd-frequency pairing is traditionally associated with a paramagnetic Meissner response, which raises questions about the stability of the superconducting phase, especially in multiband systems where odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitous. Using analytical calculations in a general two-band, we show that the quantum geometric contribution to the Meissner response from odd-frequency pairs is always diamagnetic for its interband processes, while intraband processes always yield a paramagnetic response. With odd-frequency pairing itself generated by interband pairing, an overall diamagnetic response may often be anticipated. We confirm these results with numerical calculations of models with both flat and dispersive bands. In flat band systems, where geometric effects dominate, the diamagnetic odd-frequency response can even exceed the even-frequency contribution, making odd-frequency pairs the primary source of the diamagnetic Meissner response. In a dispersive two-band system with finite quantum geometry, we similarly find a robust diamagnetic contribution from odd-frequency pairing, even when the total response turns paramagnetic due to even-frequency contributions. These results establish that quantum geometry stabilizes odd-frequency superconductivity and also identify flat-band materials as candidates for realizing odd-frequency superconductivity with a diamagnetic Meissner effect."

      "summary": "The combination of localized magnetic moments, their frustration and interaction with itinerant electrons is a key challenge of condensed matter physics. Frustrated magnetic interactions promote degenerate ground states with enhanced fluctuations, a topic that is predominantly studied in magnetic insulators. The coupling between itinerant and localized electrons in metals add complexity to the problem, and presently formulated only for extreme cases in which the itinerant electrons mediate exchange between localized spins (RKKY interaction) or suppress the formation of magnetic moments (Kondo screening). Here, we report an in-depth experimental study of the distorted Kagome metal YbAgGe, unravelling the open questions of how frustration, localized magnetism and itinerant electrons are intertwined in frustrated Kondo metals. We find that coupled itinerant and localized electrons give rise to dynamic magnetic correlations below T* ~ 20 K. At lower temperature, frustrated magnetic interactions establish anisotropic magnetic short-range correlations that culminate into antiferromagnetic long-range order below TN = 0.68 K with a significantly reduced modulated magnetic moment. We show that local moment Hamiltonians can yield limited understanding of the microscopic behaviour in frustrated metals, and prompt the extension of more sophisticated model Hamiltonians incorporating itinerant effects."

      "summary": "Atomically thin metallic chains serve as pivotal systems for studying quantum transport, with their conductance strongly linked to the orbital picture. Here, we report a non-monotonic electro-mechanical response in a gold-ferrocene junction, characterized by an unexpected conductance increase over a factor of ten upon stretching. This response is detected in the formation of ferrocene-assisted atomic gold chain in a mechanically controllable break junction at a cryogenic temperature. DFT based calculations show that tilting of molecules inside the chain modifies the orbital overlap and the transmission spectra, leading to such non-monotonic conductance evolution with stretching. This behavior, unlike typical flat conductance plateaus observed in metal atomic chains, pinpoints the unique role of conformational rearrangements during chain elongation. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the role of orbital hybridization in transport properties and offer new opportunities for designing nanoscale devices with tailored electro-mechanical characteristics."

The prolamellar body (PLB) in early plant plastid development is a classic example, forming the Diamond TPMS in a lipid-protein-pigment membrane. However, the early development of such spectacular geometric structures is poorly understood. Inspired by the presence of tubules in the micrographs of early plastid membrane formation, we explore here geometric modelling of transformations of packings of cylinders that coalesce together to form bicontinuous structures. Using computational modelling, we find that specific cylinder packings with cubic symmetry transform into highly symmetric TPMS, which now stand as a candidate set of surfaces for further investigation into the PLB, as well as other occurrences of bicontinuous membranes."

      "summary": "When a less viscous Newtonian fluid displaces an aging aqueous clay suspension in a confined space, a rich array of interfacial patterns emerges due to a predominantly viscous instability. In the present work, we controlled the mechanical properties of clay suspensions by incorporating additives and studied the interfacial instabilities that resulted when these suspensions were radially displaced by water in a Hele-Shaw cell. When the elasticity of clay was low, the interfacial dynamics exhibited features of nonlinear viscous fingering in heterogeneous media. By tuning the nature and content of additives that delay clay aging, we uncovered two novel propagation mechanisms: pattern growth via skewering and zig-zag finger propagation. These patterns have hitherto never been observed in experiments with colloidal systems. For moderate clay elasticities, we demonstrate here that shear-thinning-induced flow anisotropy leads to the formation of dendrites with dominant side branches. As clay elasticity increases due to the incorporation of salts, the energy required to create fractures becomes smaller than that for system-wide yielding. This scenario is characterized by the emergence of viscoelastic fractures. Our work demonstrates that incorporating additives is an effective strategy to manipulate the onset and growth of interfacial instabilities during the confined displacement of clay by miscible Newtonian fluids."

We focus in particular on the localization and coherence behavior of the model, extending our previous study at low temperature [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056502 (2025)]. As the temperature increases, the system becomes less localized and less coherent. The loss of coherence, which is controlled by two independent mechanisms -- a smooth damping-driven crossover and a sharp frequency-driven transition -- exhibits a nontrivial temperature dependence. While both types of coherence loss occur at lower coupling in the high temperature regime, the frequency exhibits a sharper drop at high temperatures and this drop is observed for all values of the sub-Ohmic exponent, in contrast to the zero-temperature case. We discuss the full temperature-dependent dynamical phase diagram of the system and the interplay between coherence and localization across a wide range of physical parameters."

      "summary": "Since the development of the nonlocal correlation functional vdW-DF, the family of van der Waals density functionals has grown to better describe a wide variety of systems. A recent generation of the vdW-DF family, vdW-DF3, featured a newly-constructed form of the nonlocal correlation that more accurately modeled molecular dimers, layered structures, and surface adsorption. However, it also revealed an intrinsic tradeoff in vdW-DF3's parametrization and inflexibility of exchange in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), limiting its accuracy for molecular crystals. In this paper we propose a new optimization of vdW-DF3 that is tailored to 3D molecular crystals. This functional, called vdW-DF3-mc, contains a new, tunable form of the exchange enhancement factor with parameters that directly correspond to physically relevant qualities. In addition, within the nonlocal correlation, we prioritize smoothness of the kernel switching function as a means of restoring flexibility to vdW-DF3's design. Testing vdW-DF3-mc on several benchmark sets, we achieve highly accurate energetics and geometries for molecular crystals. This is particularly evident for the case of polymorphs of ice, for which errors in the volume and cohesive energy are on the order of only 1%, indicating very promising performance for important subcategories of molecular crystals, such as polymorphism and hydrogen-bonded solids."

      "summary": "The nature of relativistic electrons in solids depends on the precise shape of the underlying band structure. Prominently, symmetry-related mechanisms, such as the breaking of time reversal symmetry in topological insulators, can lead to the emergence of band gaps on small energy scales. It is, thus, important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision, and to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the relativistic regime."

However, coupling between bimerons and pinning by defects complicate reliable motion. Here we show that a periodic array of edge defects both stabilizes transport of multiple bimerons and gives rise to a distinctive collective state, the magnetic worm. A single bimeron travels at constant speed; defects lower this speed while preserving an approximately linear relation between velocity $v$ and current density $J$. With two bimerons, the center of mass advances nearly uniformly while their separation exhibits a bounded oscillation whose frequency increases and amplitude decreases with current. For larger trains, these oscillations lose synchrony, producing segmented, worm like motion. The center of mass speed grows with current but decreases as the number of bimerons increases. Notably, eight bimerons cannot be sustained in a smooth stripe but can be stabilized by the periodic defects"

Here, we introduce a minimal model that integrates self-propulsion into the active nematic framework. Our linear stability analyses reveal how self-propulsion shifts the onset of instability, fundamentally altering the dynamical landscape. Numerical simulations confirm these predictions, showing that self-propulsion induces anti-hyperuniform fluctuations, anomalous long-range order in vorticity, and non-universal self-similar energy cascades. Notably, these long-range ordered states emerge within the active turbulence regime well before the transition to a flocking state. Additionally, our analyses highlight a non-monotonic dependence of self-organization on self-propulsion, with optimal states characterized by a peak in correlation length. These findings are relevant for understanding of active nematic systems that self-propel, such as migrating cell layers or swarming bacteria, and offer new avenues for designing synthetic systems with tailored collective behaviours, bridging the gap between active nematics and self-propulsive systems."

Persson's theory has been extensively validated and applied to investigate nearly all critical aspects of tribological problems. In contrast to the well-known Greenwood-Williamson (GW) model, Persson's theory receives relatively less attention within the tribology community. One contributing factor to this discrepancy is that the original derivation of the diffusion equation in Appendix B is not easily understandable to non-physicists. In this technical note, the authors provide supplementary information for each step of the derivation, aiming to clarify the conceptual foundation for researchers who encounter difficulties in understanding Persson's theory, thereby encouraging its broader application within and beyond tribology."

We also analyze the relation with the hybrid canonical ensemble by considering the microcanonical ensemble of a compound system composed of a hybrid subsystem weakly coupled to a reservoir and computing the marginal ensemble of the hybrid subsystem.

Moreover, to account for nuclear quantum effects, we employ path-integral MD simulations. Our results show significant changes in the direct electronic gap as a function of temperature and pressure, with a renormalization of about 80 meV due to zero-point motion. Under hydrostatic tensile pressure, the direct band gap $E_{\\Gamma}$ vanishes at the material's mechanical stability limit (spinodal point, where the bulk modulus $B \\to 0$).

Here, we use neutron scattering to study the magnetic order and spin excitations of FePSe$_3$ under uniaxial strain. In the AFM ordered state, we find that $\\sim$0.6% tensile strain significantly suppresses one zigzag domain and promotes the other two, lowering the AFM order and spin waves to $C_2$ symmetry. The broken $C_3$ symmetry in spin excitations persists slightly above $T_{\\rm{N}}\\approx 108.6$ K, where the zigzag AFM order is absent. Our results thus provide direct evidence of magnetoelastic coupling and suggest that the three-state Potts nematicity in paramagnetic spin excitations arises from the vestigial order associated with the low-temperature zigzag AFM order."

Here, we reveal the MRO in amorphous arsenic (a-As) using advanced atomistic simulations, based on machine-learned potentials derived using automated workflows. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental structure factor of a-As, especially the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP), which is a signature of MRO. We compare and contrast the structure of a-As with that of its lighter homologue, red amorphous phosphorus (a-P), identifying the dihedral-angle distribution as a key factor differentiating the MRO in both. The pressure-dependent structural behaviors of a-As and a-P differ as well, which we link to the interplay of ring topology and structural entropy. We finally show that the origin of the FSDP is closely correlated with the size and spatial distribution of voids in the amorphous networks. Our work provides fundamental insights into MRO in an amorphous elemental system, and more widely it illustrates the usefulness of automation for machine-learning-driven atomistic simulations."

      "summary": "Understanding the effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has become increasingly important in the context of nanoscale magnetism and spintronics. In this study, we derive a general structure factor equation for an S = 1/2 dimer and show that the anisotropic ratio $D_z/|J|$ and complex phase $\\phi$ of the DMI control the gap energy and intensity of the $|0,0\\rangle \\to |1,0\\rangle$ transition. {Using exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg spin-spin Hamiltonian that incorporates both isotropic and anisotropic interactions,} as well as the effects of an external magnetic field and an electric field. Our results show that the DM interaction splits energy eigenstates, induces level repulsion, and significantly modifies the spin dimer structure factor. These effects reveal a direct correspondence between thermodynamic anomalies in the heat capacity and spin-resolved selection rules."

      "summary": "Thermoelectric materials, long explored for energy harvesting and thermal sensing, convert heat directly into electrical signals. Extending their application to the terahertz (THz) frequency range opens opportunities for low-noise, bias-free THz detection, yet conventional thermoelectrics lack the sensitivity required for practical devices. Thermoelectric coefficients can be strongly enhanced near van Hove singularities (VHS), though these are usually difficult to access in conventional materials. Here we show that moir\\'e band engineering unlocks these singularities for THz optoelectronics. Using 2D moir\\'e structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced temperature gradient. Our results establish moir\\'e superlattices as a versatile platform for THz thermoelectricity and highlight engineered band structures as a route to high-performance THz optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential for understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the temperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with the exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements insufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and giving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport and umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion renormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise the electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a direct separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to resistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in magic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate transport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic angle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust quadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where standard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band scattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown of Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the interaction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron collisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes THz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling scattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials."

      "summary": "We investigate the rich non-equilibrium physics arising in periodically driven open quantum systems, specifically those realized within microcavity resonators, whose dynamics are governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian hosting Floquet Exceptional Points (FEPs). By introducing a periodically quenched driving protocol, we analytically derive the Floquet effective Hamiltonian and determine the locations of multiple FEPs harbored within the Floquet bulk bands. We demonstrate that the pair-production and annihilation of these FEPs can be precisely controlled by fine-tuning the system parameters, and zero and $\\pi$ FEPs are topologically characterized by robust integer quantized winding numbers. To probe these singularities, we introduce a bi-orthogonal Floquet fidelity susceptibility, whose value exhibits large non-zero peaks at the momentum points hosting FEPs in the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the momentum-summed susceptibility displays a sharp divergence when the number of FEPs change with respect to the time period of the drive. Our findings also reveal the emergence of Floquet edge states around zero energy and Dirac-like dispersion around $\\pi$. Moreover, our model reveals a higher-order skin effect, where the periodically driven Hamiltonian hosts skin modes localized at both edges and corners. These insights offer novel avenues for the Floquet engineering of topological singularities in driven dissipative systems, with significant potential for manipulating light and matter at the microscale."

By employing the Airy stress function method, we derive closed-form solutions that satisfy the governing biharmonic equation and the prescribed boundary conditions along the edges of the square domain. The stress components are expressed as series expansions, with coefficients determined to enforce boundary constraints. In the uniaxial compression case, the resulting stress fields exhibit strong agreement with photoelastic fringe patterns previously observed in experimental studies. For biaxial loading, the solution represents a superposition of two orthogonal compression scenarios, producing spatial variations in the principal stress difference depending on the location within the domain."

      "summary": "Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy, and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material, Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories, as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures, predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware active learning strategies."

We present our approach to developing a human-in-the-loop pipeline for operating advanced instruments including an X-ray nanoprobe beamline and an autonomous robotic station dedicated to the design and characterization of materials. Specifically, we evaluate the potential of various LLMs as trainable scientific assistants for orchestrating complex, multi-task workflows, which also include multimodal data, optimizing their performance through optional human input and iterative learning. We demonstrate the ability of AI agents to bridge the gap between advanced automation and user-friendly operation, paving the way for more adaptable and intelligent scientific facilities."

      "summary": "Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a valuable technique by which one can investigate the physical characteristics of the surfaces of materials. However, its widespread use is hampered by the time-consuming nature of running an experiment and the significant domain knowledge required. Recent studies have shown the value of multiple forms of automation in improving this, but their use is limited due to the difficulty of integrating them with SPMs other than the one it was developed for. With this in mind, we propose an automation framework for SPMs aimed toward facilitating code sharing and reusability of developed components. Our framework defines generic control and data structure schemas which are passed among independent software processes (components), with the final SPM commands sent after passing through an SPM-specific translator. This approach permits multi-language support and allows for experimental components to be decoupled among multiple computers. Our mediation logic limits access to the SPM to a single component at a time, with a simple override mechanism in order to correct detected experiment problems. To validate our proposal, we integrated and tested it with two SPMs from separate manufacturers, and ran an experiment involving a thermal drift correction component."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials that can host qubits with long spin coherence time (T2) have the distinct advantage of integrating easily with existing microelectronic and photonic platforms, making them attractive for designing novel quantum devices with enhanced performance. However, the relative lack of 2D materials as spin qubit hosts, as well as appropriate substrates that can help maintain long T2, necessitates a strategy to search for candidates with robust spin coherence. Here, we develop a high-throughput computational workflow to predict the nuclear spin bath-driven qubit decoherence and T2 in 2D materials and heterostructures. We initially screen 1173 2D materials and find 190 monolayers with T2 > 1 ms, higher than that of naturally-abundant diamond. We then construct 1554 lattice-commensurate heterostructures between high-T2 2D materials and select 3D substrates, and we find that T2 is generally lower in a heterostructure than in the bare 2D host material; however, low-noise substrates (such as CeO2 and CaO) can help maintain high T2. To further accelerate the material screening effort, we derive analytical models that enable rapid predictions of T2 for 2D materials and heterotructures. The models offer a simple, yet quantitative, way to determine the relative contributions to decoherence from the nuclear spin baths of the 2D host and substrate in a heterostructural system. By developing a high-throughput workflow and analytical models, we expand the genome of 2D materials and their spin coherence times for the development of spin qubit platforms."

Still, understanding the atomistic details of Co$_3$O$_4$-water interfaces under operando conditions remains extremely challenging. While ab initio molecular dynamics have become an essential tool for investigating these dynamic interfaces in silico, they are limited to only a few picoseconds and a few hundred atoms. In this work, we overcome these limitations by training a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) on density functional theory data, which allows us to significantly extend the accessible time and length scales. Employing this HDNNP, we perform simulations to unravel the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of Co$_3$O$_4$(001)-water interfaces in detail. Our simulations reveal distinct characteristics of the two possible A and B terminations. The B-terminated surface stabilizes a compact, quasi-epitaxial hydration layer with strong templating effects, enhanced hydroxylation, and a well-organized hydrogen-bond network. In contrast, the A-termination forms a more diffuse contact layer with weaker templating, lower hydroxylation, and less ordered interfacial water. Extended simulations further uncover proton transfer pathways, including intermittent protonation of surface hydroxyls, migration of water molecules into the epitaxial layer, and rare hydronium-like configurations."

By relating a general linear transformation matrix to the system's Hamiltonian, we use an extended thin-layer method to derive an effective Hamiltonian for tangential motion under mild and general linear transformations. Explicit forms are provided for three fundamental transformations: rotation, scaling, and shearing. Rotation introduces a gauge field coupled to angular momentum, while scaling and shearing produce geometric potentials that lift degeneracies in non-circular cross sections. In square cross sections, these transformations cause energy splittings among formerly degenerate states, whereas circular cross sections retain degeneracy. Through an example combining rotation and squeezing, we analyze state evolution and compute the quantum geometric tensor to quantify geometric response. Our results demonstrate how geometric transformations can tailor quantum states and suggest that circular waveguides are more robust against mode mixing."

      "summary": "Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations."

      "summary": "Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) is a well-established method for studying the dynamic response of matter in the femtosecond or optical range. In this method, the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions are propagated forward in time, and in principle, one can extract any observable at any given time. Alternatively, by taking a Fourier transform, spectroscopic quantities can be extracted. There are many publicly available codes implementing rt-TDDFT, which differ in their numeric solution of the KS equations, their available exchange-correlation functionals, and in their analysis capabilities. For users of rt-TDDFT, this is an inconvenient situation because they may need to use a numerical method that is available in one code, but an analysis method available in another. Here, we introduce rhodent, a modular Python package for processing the output of rt-TDDFT calculations. Our package can be used to calculate hot-carrier distributions, energies, induced densities, and dipole moments, and various decompositions thereof. In its current version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but can readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under the assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the response to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band perturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent excitations. We demonstrate the capabilities of rhodent via a set of examples, for systems consisting of Al and Ag clusters and organic molecules."

      "summary": "Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths."

We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\\gamma<\\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries.

The associated heat flow $I_Q$ has been understood since the advent of thermodynamics by a process of elimination, $I_Q{=}I_E{-}\\mu I_N$, subtracting from the energy flow $I_E$ its convective contribution. However, in the quantum limit, this formula implies the paradoxical result that the entropy entrained by heat flow is unbounded even though the entropy itself tends to zero. We resolve this conundrum by recognizing that the traditional formula for heat is missing a quantum term. The correct quantum formula predicts that the heat produced in quantum processes is vastly smaller than previously believed, with correspondingly beneficial consequences for the efficiency of quantum machines."

The elliptic pseudosphere is considered as an exactly solvable background geometry. The topological contribution is separated in the Hadamard function for general phases in the periodicity condition along the compact dimension. Two equivalent expressions are provided for the component of the current density in that direction. The corresponding VEV is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with a period equal to the flux quantum. In the flat spacetime limit, we recover the result for a conical space with a general value of the planar angle deficit. Near the origin of the elliptic pseudosphere, the effect of the spatial curvature on the vacuum current density is weak. The same applies for small values of the length of the compact dimension. Using the conformal relations between the elliptic pseudosphere and the (2+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with a planar angle deficit, we determine the current densities for a conformally coupled massless scalar field in the static and hyperbolic vacuum states of locally de Sitter spacetime."

      "summary": "Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain."

Recently, we demonstrated the highly selective synthesis of kekulene (>99%) on Cu(111) and isokekulene (92%) on Cu(110) from the same molecular precursor (Ruan et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, e202509932). Scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized tips can identify the single molecules on the basis of their geometric structure at a low coverage on Cu(110), but it also detects complex features due to electronic contributions close to the Fermi energy. Here, we investigate the origin of these features by simulating STM images based on a weighted sum of multiple molecular orbitals, for which we employ weights based on the calculated molecular-orbital projected density of states. This allows for an experimental confirmation of charge transfer from the surface into multiple formerly unoccupied molecular orbitals for single molecules of kekulene as well as isokekulene in its two nonplanar adsorption configurations. In comparison, the area-integrating photoemission orbital tomography technique confirms the charge transfer as well as the high selectivity for the formation of a full monolayer of mainly isokekulene on Cu(110). Our STM-based approach is applicable to a wide range of adsorbed molecular systems and specifically also suited for strongly interacting surfaces, nonplanar molecules, and such molecules which can only be prepared at extremely low yields."

However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design."

Here, we develop a finite-frequency quantum kinetic theory of THG based on the density matrix formalism, deriving the third-harmonic conductivity tensor. Our framework isolates five distinct band-geometric contributions to interband and intraband processes, separates Fermi sea from Fermi surface terms, and incorporates disorder effects phenomenologically. We further provide a complete symmetry classification of THG for all 122 magnetic point groups. Applying the theory to the spin-split altermagnet RuO$_2$, we trace its THG response to specific geometric terms. These results establish a predictive foundation for designing materials with enhanced and tunable THG in the finite-frequency regime."

However, its practical sensitivity is limited by the intrinsically weak photoluminescence of the spin ensemble. Here, we report a photoluminescence enhancement of up to 30 times from VB- centers in suspended regions of hBN compared to those in substrate-supported areas. The key spin properties, such as the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast and linewidth, as well as the spin lifetime, of the VB- centers in this region are well preserved. Detailed investigations, including measurements of zero-field ODMR, Raman spectroscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy, reveal a correlation between emission enhancement and local deformation in the sample. It is concluded that the suspended regions exhibit higher local deformation compared to the supported areas, breaking the local symmetry and thereby activating otherwise forbidden or weak optical transitions of the VB- centers."

      "summary": "Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion number density becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion number density, $n_f$. For sufficiently large $n_f$ and low velocity, the collision of two vortices results in a pseudostable bound state with winding number $m=2$ that eventually becomes unstable and decays into two $m=1$ vortices. For large $n_f$ and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction."

Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise, namely, they acquire the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, the consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, the consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps (if initial opinions are in a general position). The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is equal to $k\\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps, e.g., we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants."

In this work, we define optimal e-values for testing between maximum entropy models, both in the microcanonical (hard constraints) and canonical (soft constraints) settings. We show that, when testing between two hypotheses that are both microcanonical, the so-called growth-rate optimal e-variable admits an exact analytical expression, which also serves as a valid e-variable in the canonical case. For canonical tests, where exact solutions are typically unavailable, we introduce a microcanonical approximation and verify its excellent performance via both theoretical arguments and numerical simulations. We then consider constrained binary models, focusing on $2 \\times k$ contingency tables -- an essential framework in statistics and a natural representation for various models of complex systems. Our microcanonical optimal e-variable performs well in both settings, constituting a new tool that remains effective even in the challenging case when the number $k$ of groups grows with the sample size, as in models with growing features used for the analysis of real-world heterogeneous networks and time-series."

      "summary": "The accuracy of the information that can be extracted from electron diffraction patterns is often limited by the presence of optical distortions. Existing distortion characterization techniques typically require knowledge of the reciprocal lattice of either the sample of interest or a separate calibration sample, the latter of which would need to be swapped in, thus adding time and inconvenience to an experiment. To overcome this limitation, we develop a deep learning (DL) framework for measuring and correcting combinations of different types of optical distortion in CBED patterns. Quantitative performance tests of our DL model are conducted using testing datasets of artificial distorted CBED patterns of molybdenum disulfide on amorphous carbon, with varying sizes of CBED disks, that are generated using multislice simulations. The performance test results of our DL approach are benchmarked against those obtained using a conventional distortion estimation technique that uses the radial gradient maximization (RGM) technique and knowledge of the reciprocal lattice system. While the RGM approach outperforms our DL approach for the CBED patterns with very small disks, our DL approach outperforms the RGM approach for the CBED patterns with medium-sized disks, as well as those with large overlapping disks. The benchmarking results suggest that our DL approach, which does not require knowledge of the sample, achieves a good compromise between convenience and accuracy. We also show how our DL framework can be used to improve experimental ptychographic reconstructions, and to correct optical distortion in experimental selected area electron diffraction patterns."

Using experimentally validated thermodynamic data and heat-transfer estimates, we quantify the energy expenditure and number of cycles required to achieve ultrahigh-purity separation. The LB method achieves eight-9s purity in a single cycle with just 39.4~kJ/mol, while fractional distillation and Molex require multiple iterations and up to five orders of magnitude more energy. Each method is also benchmarked against the thermodynamic minimum work of separation of the mixture of interest. It is found that the LB technique operates within a factor of 23 of this lower bound, compared to $\\sim 10^2$ for Molex (Molex is a trademark and/or service mark of UOP Inc.) and $\\sim 10^5$ for fractional distillation, demonstrating its thermodynamic and operational superiority."

      "summary": "Anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit direction-dependent optical and electronic properties, making them valuable for tailoring directional light-matter interactions. Rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$) stands out for its strong in-plane anisotropy and its thickness-independent direct-bandgap excitons, which can hybridize with light to form exciton-polaritons. In parallel, metasurfaces, engineered arrays of nanoscale subwavelength resonators, can support ultra-sharp photonic modes in the form of quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs). Topological transformations of photonic modes can give rise to flatbands, i.e., dispersionless states with quenched kinetic energy and vanishing group velocity. Intrinsic material anisotropy offers an unexplored route to robust far-field flatband formation and control. Here, we demonstrate how structuring an intrinsically anisotropic excitonic material into a resonant metasurface fundamentally transforms its photonic topological features and light-matter coupling behavior, allowing us to drive and topologically control extended far-field flatband formation. To this end, we fabricate C$_4$-symmetric metasurfaces directly from bulk ReS$_2$. The intrinsic anisotropy lifts the initial double degeneracy of the qBIC mode and yields two distinctly polarized resonances. It also reshapes the topological landscape: the integer topological charge of the qBIC mode splits into momentum-separated half-integer singularities, thereby flattening the far-field photonic dispersion. The resulting topologically-controlled photonic flatbands are then tuned in resonance with the linearly polarized excitonic transitions of ReS$_2$, resulting in two distinct, directionally hybridized exciton-polariton flatband regimes. These findings establish anisotropic vdW metasurfaces as a new platform for topologically engineered flatbands and flatband-driven light-matter coupling."

However, it remains unclear how such environmental variation influences adaptation, what is learned in the process, and whether memory of past conditions is retained. In this work, we investigate these questions using athermal disordered systems that are subject to cyclic inverse design, enabling them to attain target elastic properties spanning a chosen range. We demonstrate that such systems evolve toward a marginally absorbing manifold (MAM), which encodes memory of the training range that closely resembles return-point memory observed in cyclically driven systems. We further propose a general mechanism for the formation of MAMs and the corresponding memory that is based on gradient discontinuities in the trained quantities. Our model provides a simple and broadly applicable physical framework for understanding how adaptive systems learn under environmental change and how they retain memory of past experiences."

This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks."

The effect of marginal current-current $(J,{\\overline J})$ perturbations is to induce a deformation of the Hilbert space given by a Lorentz boost in the 2D space of currents, which is identified with a Bogoliubov transformation. The rapidity of the boost is determined by the coupling constant of the marginal perturbation. When the perturbation is diagonal in the original currents of the theory, there is a linear relation between the two, and non-linear otherwise. In the fermionic cases, both free and with Calogero-Sutherland interactions, the marginal perturbation corresponds to backward scattering processes."

We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus."

Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow the realization of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most implementations of waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide coupling. Here, we study a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a high-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA), thus implementing a \\emph{giant atom} in a structured photonic environment. The non-local coupling produces interference with the CCA eigenmodes, selectively enhancing interaction with long-wavelength (low-effective $k$), symmetric modes about the array center, while suppressing coupling to antisymmetric and short-wavelength modes. For a subset of symmetric, low-effective $k$ modes, we reach the superstrong coupling regime. In this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal strongly hybridized eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit participation at the frequency of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in agreement with theory. Time-domain measurements of the qubit dynamics show clear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings model, marked by the emergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking inversion symmetry, the qubit seeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left of the qubit, which we exploit to implement and characterize a chiral photon-emission protocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode light--matter interaction in a structured photonic environment."

Here we show that, when suitably engineered, environmental noise can induce a \"Zeno-like\" stabilization of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery. To explore this interplay, we study a system size N=6, which provides large storage capacity with moderate computational cost, and more importantly, allows the stored energy to become almost fully extractable since the ergotropy nearly coincides with the total capacity. We analyze three local noise channels: bit flip, phase flip, and bit phase flip. We vary the strength of each channel to emulate frequent environmental monitoring, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect, and track its influence on the charging dynamics and stored energy. The phase-flip channel slows charging under strong noise but stabilizes stored energy and ergotropy. The bit-flip channel enables faster charging but saturates at low capacities, while the bit phase flip channel combines both features. In the discharging stage, different noise channels lead to distinct release dynamics, showing that noise can paradoxically enhance and stabilize quantum battery operation."

Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration, is a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to fully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles may still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of the transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from U.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission capacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate transmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational CO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable capacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that benefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle electrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted increase in transmission capacity. Our findings underscore the pressing need to enhance transmission infrastructure to unlock the climate benefits of large-scale electrification and renewable integration."

      "summary": "We present the operating principle of a quantum sensor for electric fields based on networks of Rydberg atoms. The sensing mechanism exploits the dependence of the Rydberg blockade on the electric field, particularly in the vicinity of the F\\\"{o}rster resonance - the electric field can be measured through the variation in the size of the blockade radius across the network of Rydberg atoms. Specifically, we track the dynamics of Rydberg excitations in systems of various spatial structures, subjected to different electric field configurations, to monitor the connection between the field and blockade. We also use the density-density correlator to analyse spatially varying (inhomogeneous) electric fields and relate these correlators to the applied fields."

      "summary": "Microbiomes are complex systems comprised of many interacting species. Species can survive harsh or changing conditions by rapid adaptation, a process accelerated by the exchange of genetic material between different species through horizontal gene transfer. Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species. Therefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a microbial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of antimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes. However, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally focused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates, overlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity of microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of positive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and diverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates population-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show that we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid to be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the conjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community. Then, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and conjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of positive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial communities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new perspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids."

      "summary": "Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that makes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time inference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it serves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of how self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use a simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input signal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex systems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and independently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when switching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system completely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance landscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection force improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of the driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of smooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent gradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological systems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms, which manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably improving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We further perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases that arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer. Overall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are particularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the predictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological richness, conveys robustness and adaptivity."

Here, we demonstrate an analogous phenomenon in a purely static context. We show that the buckling patterns of an elastic beam resting on a modulated Winkler foundation display the same kind of frequency lock-in observed in dynamic systems. Through simulations and experiments, we reveal that compressed elastic strips with modulated height alternate between predictable quasi-periodic and periodic buckling modes. Our findings uncover previously unexplored analogies between structural and dynamic instabilities, highlighting how even simple elastic structures can give rise to rich and intriguing behaviors."

Calibrated impulses from a nearby atomic force microscope (AFM) tip serve a dual role: they implement mechanical pi/2 rotations for Ramsey interferometry and realize phase-space displacements for Wigner function tomography via displaced-parity sampling. The same actuator thus unifies control and tomography while avoiding optical heating and eliminating on-chip microwave drive lines at the resonator. We derive explicit control pulse sequences and a master-equation description that map measured signals onto the energy-relaxation and phase-coherence times, as well as onto parity-based quantum signatures, including negative regions of the Wigner function. The approach is compatible with multiple readout modalities: direct AFM deflection, dispersive coupling to a Cooper-pair box, and dispersive microwave cavity probing. Together, these techniques provide complete access to populations, coherence, and parity within a single device architecture. This minimal scheme provides a practical route to all-mechanical quantum control and state-resolved characterization of decoherence in mesoscopic mechanical systems."

This is achieved by introducing mathematical and computational methods that estimate the probability of transmission trees by combining generative models that jointly determine the number of infected hosts, the probability of infection between them depending on location and genetic information, and their time of infection and sampling. We introduce a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that we show to sample trees according to their probability. Statistics performed over the sampled trees lead to probabilistic estimations of network properties and other quantities of interest, such as the number of unobserved hosts and the depth of the infection tree. We confirm the validity of our approach by comparing the numerical results with analytically solvable examples. Finally, we apply our methodology to data from COVID-19 in Australia. We find that network properties that are important for the management of the outbreak depend sensitively on the type of data used in the inference."

While the standard ETH is formulated in the absence of degeneracy, physical systems often possess symmetries that induce degenerate energy eigenstates. In this paper, we investigate ETH in the presence of nontrivial projective representations of Abelian symmetries, which arise naturally from 't Hooft anomalies. We argue that such projective structures can lead to degenerate excited states, and how the ETH can be formulated under such degeneracies. In the presence of projective charges supplied by symmetry operators, our projective-representation ETH indicates that the stationary values of the operators are described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble instead of the standard Gibbs ensemble. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry and degeneracy in quantum thermalization and pave the way for further exploration of the ETH in anomalous symmetry settings."

      "summary": "The quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect (QPME) is a counterintuitive phenomenon wherein a quantum system relaxes more rapidly through a two-step evolution protocol than through direct evolution under a symmetric Hamiltonian alone. In this protocol, the system first evolves under a symmetry-breaking Hamiltonian and then switches to a symmetric one. We demonstrate that QPME occurs under both real-time and imaginary-time dynamics with respect to $U(1)$-symmetry. Using tilted ferromagnetic initial states, we demonstrate that a transient asymmetric evolution significantly accelerates thermalization or convergence to the ground state for both real-time and imaginary-time evolutions, respectively. The effect is pronounced for small tilt angles, while larger tilts or antiferromagnetic initial states suppress it. Numerical evidence across different system sizes confirms the robustness of QPME, demonstrating its stability in the thermodynamic limit. This finding not only deepens our fundamental understanding of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena but also opens new possibilities for accelerating quantum simulation and computation."

In this framework, non-unanimous influence groups affect the focal agent through weighted contributions governed by a bias parameter $p$. We extend this setting by introducing a fraction $\\alpha$ ($\\alpha> 0$) of contrarians, defined as agents who systematically oppose the prevailing influence irrespective of whether the group is unanimous or divided. Analytical mean-field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the final states of the system are governed by simple phase boundaries: regions of positive and negative majority separated by the lines $p=1/2$ and $\\alpha=1/2$, with equally-mixed states confined to these boundaries. While low contrarian densities are insufficient to overturn the bias, higher values of $\\alpha$ systematically drive the system closer to a balanced coexistence of opinions, though exact parity is prevented by the presence of bias $p$. We further analyze the temporal relaxation of opinions and extract the characteristic timescales of convergence. Our findings highlight how contrarians, acting as structured non-conformists, can suppress consensus and maintain opinion diversity, while internal biases ultimately hinder a perfectly even split."

      "summary": "Phonon-polaritons propagating in crystal volume offer the possibility of transferring information throughout matter (via phonons) at high (photon-like) velocity and tunable frequency/wavelength in the far-infrared. However, from the phonon-polariton Raman cross section, the phonon and photon advantages seem mutually exclusive. Either the phonon-polaritons are fast (photon-like) but hardly supported by the lattice (not phonon-like), or they are well supported by the lattice (testified by a high Raman efficiency) but slow (not photon-like). An optimal phonon-photon coupling is currently searched for in hexagonal-GaN by near-forward Raman scattering across parallel crystal faces with in-plane singular c-axis. Two accessible phonons, i.e., the ordinary A1 and E1 ones, plus two refractive indices, i.e., the ordinary and extraordinary ones, generate various phonon-polariton candidates. Notably, in perfect forward Raman scattering and in crossed polarizations of the incident (along c) and scattered lights, which, altogether, maximizes the transferred wavevector to the crystal at minimum scattering angle, a fast phonon-polariton, stemming from the bottleneck of the E1 dispersion on entry to the deep photon-like regime, is activated. It is well supported by the lattice since its Raman signal is strong and sharp, enhanced by multi-reflection of the laser beam between crystal faces at near-normal incidence. This fast Raman-enhanced phonon-polariton is interesting for infrared-photonics in that it cumulates the advantages of a photon (speed) and of a phonon (Raman intensity). Besides, it commutates from a phonon-polariton to a phonon by deviating from normal incidence or by permuting the incident and scattered polarizations, with potential applications as a vibrational/optical switch."

      "summary": "Stochastic processes on graphs are a powerful tool for modelling complex dynamical systems such as epidemics. A recent line of work focused on the inference problem where one aims to estimate the state of every node at every time, starting from partial observation of a subset of nodes at a subset of times. In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be random i.i.d. over nodes. Such an assumption may not be realistic in practice, where one may have access to a set of covariate variables for every node that influence the initial state of the system. In this work, we will assume that the initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables. Given that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a model where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably the single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables. Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior information enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories. We derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP) algorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included in the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators that either use only the spreading information or use only the information from the covariate variables. We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase transitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network weights. These transitions create a statistical-to-computational gap where even the BP-AMP algorithm, despite the theoretical possibility of perfect recovery, fails to achieve it."

The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\\epsilon$ to $\\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors."

While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\\delta$ in the system-state with $\\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ gates, $\\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates."

These spin systems are equivalent to a set of spinless lattice fermions subjected to a random on site potential and sparse density-density interactions. In the absence of the random magnetic field we also obtain a suppression of the L-R bounds as $ \\Delta^{-1} $. These results follow from the application of a general theorem about the L-R bound of a generic local time-dependent one-dimensional spin system with local time-dependent perturbations. Adopting the interaction picture of the dynamics, the large and sparse $ ZZ $ perturbations of the $ XY $ model, with or without disorder, are mapped into high-frequency periodic perturbations. All our results are non-perturbative."

Particular emphasis is made on describing crucial physical assumptions and the validity range of the described theoretical approaches and predictive models. The classical sharp interface treatment of thermodynamic systems where a perfectly smooth surface is assumed to separate homogeneous phases can present significant limitations when analyzing systems that are subject to thermal motion and present multiple metastable states caused by interfacial heterogeneities of nanoscale dimensions. Mesoscopic approaches such as stochastic Langevin dynamics can extend the application of sharp interface models to a wide variety of systems exhibiting metastability as they undergo thermal motion. For such metastable systems, dynamic and kinetic equations can describe the evolution of observable (macroscopic) variables as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. Sufficiently close to equilibrium, Kramers theory of thermally activated escape from metastable states can be effectively employed to describe diverse wetting and interfacial processes via kinetic equations. Future directions for further advancement and application of thermodynamic, dynamic, and kinetic models are briefly discussed in the context of current technological developments involving nanoparticles, nanofluidics, and nanostructured surfaces."

Numerical solution of the Smoluchowski equation and analytical predictions from Kramers theory document distinct regimes at different distances $|\\Delta q|=|q-q_E|$ from stable equilibrium at $q=q_E$.

      "summary": "One of the most spectacular properties associated with Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is superfluidity in which the system exhibits zero viscosity and flows without dissipation. The superfluid phase has been observed in wide ranging Bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid - termed a supersolid. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained elusive. Here we report observation of a superfluid to insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magneto-excitons. Mapping the transport behavior of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature, suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid upon increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase."

The isentropic temperature cooling from the loading curve is recovered by heating after the specimen fractures when the load is released. These measurements establish for the first time isentropic thermal recovery in two engineering alloys. The materials tested are an AISI 4340 steel and an aluminum 2024 alloy. Measurements of the isentropic thermo-elastic stress cooling are -0.61 K/GPa for steel and -1.7 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic thermo-elastic stress heating is -1.16 K/GPa for steel and -1.6 K/GPa for aluminum alloy.

This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain observed KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating the model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying a fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena."

However, time-reversal invariant TSCs based on conventional linear Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) are fundamentally restricted to a helical $p$-wave state, hosting only a single Majorana Kramers pair. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the unique triple-winding spin texture of cubic RSOC offers a direct pathway to surpass this limitation. We propose a bilayer model where the synergy of cubic RSOC and an intrinsic odd-parity pairing instability yields a rare 2D helical $f$-wave TSC. This state is characterized by a large mirror Chern number (MCN) ${\\cal N}_{\\text{M}}=3$ and hosts three Kramers pairs of Majorana edge modes. Furthermore, the interplay of linear and cubic RSOCs can yield a hybrid helical $p+f$-wave TSC with an even larger MCN of ${\\cal N}_{\\text{M}}=4$. Our work establishes higher-order spin-orbit coupling as a powerful design principle for realizing TSCs with multiple Majorana Kramers channels, holding immediate relevance for tunable platforms like oxide heterostructures."

It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, {as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature}. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear departure as $\\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\\alpha q^2\\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the sound wave and the typical collision time $\\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\\alpha>0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second-order hydrodynamics."

However, the lack of comprehensive mobility data for high-angle grain boundaries in typical polycrystalline samples has impeded gaining insights into the factors that govern boundary migration. Here, we propose an Iterative Mobility Matching (IMM) methodology to determine local mobility values and their spatial variations along recrystallization boundaries in partially recrystallized samples. This method optimizes mobility inputs in a phase field model by matching simulated microstructures with time-series recrystallization experiments. We first validate this method using synthetic data before applying it to real experimental data. For the first time, we reveal a three-order-magnitude variation in local mobility along individual recrystallization boundaries. The results show that local mobility depends strongly on boundary misorientation, and its variation significantly influences boundary dynamics, shedding light on the interplay of factors that impact the observed boundary migration behavior. The IMM methodology offers a new framework for interpreting experimental recrystallization behavior and can be broadly applied to other materials using in situ experiments."

Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our 'post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and at first we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. We then study the effects of measuring the system in a basis where the standard (unmeasured) SSE is sign-free: For measurement schemes with this property, we can calculate correlations in all post-measurement states without a sign problem. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements."

We show that the mutual coupling of the spin-polarized surface states of the TI to both the squeezed magnons and the circularly polarized cavity photons results in a Chern-Simons term that activates the stronger electric, rather than magnetic, dipole coupling. Moreover, a squeezing-mediated enhancement of the coupling is achieved due to the unequal interfacial exchange coupling to the AFM sublattices, resulting in a coupling strength up to several orders stronger than for direct magnon-photon coupling. While direct cavity-AFM coupling has so far been limited in its applicability due to weak or low frequency coupling, this result may advance the utilization of high-frequency cavity magnonics and enable its incorporation into quantum information technology."

      "summary": "Many microswimmers are inherently chiral, and this chirality can introduce fascinating behaviors in a collection of microswimmers. The dynamics become even more intriguing when two types of microswimmers with distinct chirality are mixed. Our study examines a mixture of self-propelled particles with opposite chirality, investigating how the system's characteristics evolve as the magnitude of chirality is varied. In weakly chiral systems, the particles exhibit similar behavior, leading to a globally flocking phase where both types of particles are well-mixed. However, in an intermediate range of chirality, the condensates of different particles are formed as a result of a competition between chirality and self-propulsion. This competition results in interesting phases within the system. We explore the characteristics of these distinct phases in detail, focusing on the roles of self-propulsion speed and chirality."

CFT derives dynamical forces and a complete set of conjugate relations: (i) It yields generalized Maxwell-Onsager relations, applicable far from equilibrium; (ii) It constructs dynamical models from mixed force-observable constraints; and (iii) It reveals new relationships -- including an ``equal-traffic'' rule for optimizing molecular motors, and a ``third Kirchhoff's law'' of stochastic transport -- and can resolve some dynamical paradoxes."

Exciton-polariton condensates, being intrinsically driven-dissipative, offer a promising platform for observing non-equilibrium universal features. By conducting extensive numerical simulations of an incoherently pumped and interacting condensate coupled to an exciton reservoir we show that the effective nonlinearity of the condensate phase dynamics can be finely adjusted across a broad range, by varying the exciton-polariton interaction strength, allowing one to probe three main universal regimes with parameters accessible in current experiments: the weakly nonlinear Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime, where the phase fluctuations dominate, but the phase profile does not become rough, the strongly non-linear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang regime, where the condensate phase fluctuations grow in a superdiffusive manner leading to roughening of the phase, and a vortex-dominated phase emerging at stronger interactions, where both density and phase dynamics play significant roles. Our results provide a unified picture of the phase diagram of 2d exciton-polariton condensates under incoherent pumping, and shed light on recent experimental and numerical observations."

We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound."

      "summary": "Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided."

      "summary": "A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we study under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always unstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to contract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now show that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active deformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable when the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We moreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability of the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of active tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional feedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken together, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust active tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion."

      "summary": "Many-body excitons in CrSBr are attracting intense interest in view of their highly anisotropic magneto-optical coupling and their potential for novel optical interfaces within spintronic and magnonic devices. Characterizing the orbital character and propagation of these electronic excitations is crucial for understanding and controlling their behavior; however, this information is challenging to access. Ultra-high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is a momentum-resolved technique that can address these crucial questions. We present measurements collected at the Cr $L_3$-edge which show a rich spectrum of excitations with a variety of spin-orbital characters. While most of these excitations appear to be localized, the dispersion of the lowest energy dark exciton indicates that it is able to propagate along both the $a$ and $b$ directions within the planes of the crystal. This two-dimensional character is surprising as it contrasts with electrical conductivity and the behavior of the bright exciton, both of which are strongly one-dimensional. The discovery of this propagating dark exciton highlights an unusual coexistence of one- and two-dimensional electronic behaviors in CrSBr."

      "summary": "Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the crucial factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength. This is in stark contrast to the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction strength and the SOC strength, as well as that of the Rydberg interaction strength and the Raman coupling strength, respectively. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, Rydberg interactions, and nonlinear contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures, including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system."

However, due to the neglect of non-expansion work, the Clapeyron equation does not account for the effect of changes in phase transition enthalpy on equilibrium. In this paper, by analyzing the electric-field-induced changes in phase transition enthalpy and incorporating the non-expansion work performed on the system, we extended both the Clapeyron and Clausius-Clapeyron equations to explicitly include variations in phase transition enthalpy. Building upon these extensions, analytical expressions for the vapor pressure of liquids and for the total evaporation rate of sessile liquid droplets as functions of the change in vaporization enthalpy have been derived, showing that an approximately 1% decrease in vaporization enthalpy of a liquid can cause an increase of about 20% in its vapor pressure and an almost twofold increase in its evaporation rate. The theoretical predictions by the present equations were compared and found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations."

      "summary": "Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency {\\xi}JDL of Si largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overturns the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies."

Here, we first highlight the limitations of traditional detailed balance or Shockley-Queisser (SQ) analysis towards the design of Perovskite/Silicon tandem solar cells. Through well-calibrated numerical simulations, we evaluate geographic location-specific annual energy yield (EY) and quantify the influence of temperature-dependent material and transport parameters. Our results indicate that the EY scales in a near-identical manner with the top cell band gap(EgT) for various geographic locations. In comparison to SQ analysis, our simulations predict a twofold relaxation in the target degradation rates at which perovskites over a broad range of band gaps could yield a comparable levelized cost of Energy (LCOE). These insights are of broad interest for the development of perovskite materials, and test protocols to evaluate the stability of Perovskite-Silicon tandem solar cells."

      "summary": "Recent studies have revealed magnetically controllable thermoelectric effects in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) structures. A tunable cryogenic thermoelectric generator needs not only a high conversion factor between electricity and heat, but also a large change in the thermoelectric output when switching the magnetic state of the device. However, the reported modifications in thermoelectric power are either minimal, involve superconductors with relatively low critical temperatures (below 1 K), or do not utilize commercially available spintronic materials. Here, we experimentally measure and numerically model thermoelectric effects in fully epitaxial F/S/F junctions based on commercially available, easily grown materials, as well as their dependence on the magnetic configuration of the F electrodes. We observe sizeable Seebeck coefficients for the parallel alignment of the ferromagnetic electrodes, reaching values of about $100$~$\\mu$V/K. Importantly, we find a decrease of the thermoelectric signal of more than an order of magnitude when switching from a parallel to an antiparallel configuration, constituting a large thermoelectric spin-valve effect. Theoretical modeling based on a self-consistent non-equilibrium Keldysh-Usadel Green's function theory, combined with micromagnetic simulations, qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings. The thermoelectric effect is optimized when there is a large spin-dependent electron-hole asymmetry in the superconductor combined with spin-dependent transmission through the interfaces. These findings pave the way for the development of efficient and versatile cryogenic thermoelectric heat engines."

Our combined experimental and theoretical results point toward a nonmagnetic ground state as the most consistent description of the optical and vibrational properties of bulk RuO$_2$. RuO$_2$ strained to TiO$_2$ (001) remains nonmagnetic in our calculations. Straining to TiO$_2$ (110) stabilizes ferromagnetic and altermagnetic states that are nearly degenerate and both lower in energy than the nonmagnetic state. The relative energetic ordering of these states is highly sensitive to the level of strain and the choice of exchange-correlation approximation."

Condensing the elementary quasiparticles of an Abelian FQH state results in a new Abelian phase at a different filling factor, and this process can be iterated \\textit{ad infinitum}. We show that condensing clusters of the same quasiparticles into an Abelian state can instead realize non-Abelian FQH states. In particular, condensing quasiparticle pairs in the $\\nu=\\frac{2}{3}$ Laughlin state yields the anti-Pfaffian phase at half-filling. We moreover show that the successive condensation of Laughlin quasiparticles produces quantum Hall states whose fillings coincide with the most prominent plateaus in the first excited Landau level of GaAs. More generally, such condensation can realize any non-Abelian FQH state that admits a parton representation. This surprising result is supported by an exact analysis of explicit wavefunctions, field theory arguments, conformal-field theory constructions of trial states, and numerical simulations."

Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled local moment ``swapover'' and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit.

      "summary": "The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds can be utilized as low-cost, highly versatile quantum sensors for studying surface properties in condensed matter physics through the application of relaxometry protocols. For such applications, a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic relaxation processes of NV centers in nanodiamonds is necessary. Here, we study the spin-lattice relaxation rates of NV ensembles in nanodiamonds with average diameters of 40 nm and 3 $\\mu$m between room temperature and $\\sim$ 6 K. The NV relaxation curves fit to a stretched-exponential form with a stretching exponent $\\alpha \\approx 0.7$, implying the large distribution of relaxation times of individual centers within nanodiamonds. We determine the Orbach-like scattering on phonons as the leading relaxation mechanism. Finally, we discuss the viability of nanodiamonds as surface sensors when deposited on a metallic substrate and emphasize the need for well-controlled surface preparation techniques."

      "summary": "Molecular motors are in charge of almost every process in the life cycle of cells, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell locomotion, hence being of crucial importance for understanding the cellular dynamics. However, given their size scales on the order of nanometers, direct measurements are rather challenging, and the information that can be extracted from them is limited. In this work, we propose strategies based on martingale theory in stochastic thermodynamics to infer thermodynamic properties of molecular motors using a limited amount of available information. In particular, we use two recent theoretical results valid for systems arbitrary far of equilibrium: the integral fluctuation theorem (IFT) at stopping times, and a family of bounds to the maximal excursions of entropy production. The potential of these strategies is illustrated with a simple model for the F1-ATPase rotary molecular motor, where our approach is able to estimate several quantities determining the thermodynamics of the motor, such as the rotational work of the motor performed against an externally applied force, or the effective environmental temperature."

In general, collective excitations in superconductors can provide crucial information on the symmetry of the broken phase, in particular, serving as a fingerprint for determining the groundstate gap symmetry. In this work, we consider several even parity two-dimensional TRSB superconductors characterized by an order parameter of the form $\\Delta = \\Delta_1 + i\\Delta_2$. We provide a classification scheme of the collective excitations in the above systems as a function of the ratio between the components $\\Delta_1/\\Delta_2$. In order to excite the modes in the systems we have adopted two different probes: a quench of the condensate symmetry and a finite momentum transfer induced by an external electric field. Both methods allow us to excite and characterize the different modes in the spectra. To further interpret the results of the numerical calculations we provide a Ginzburg-Landau analysis and we construct a dynamical theory, deriving the linearized equations of motion in the pseudospin formalism. Our results could help distinguish between different order parameters symmetries of a TRSB superconducting condensate and estimate the magnitude of its different components."

      "summary": "A standard description of superfluid helium-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations (treated as an ideal Bose gas under the temperature $1.3K$) and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond the HVBK model. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher counter-flow velocities, where the usual splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-fluid model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments."

Here, we show that an activity gradient breaks fore-aft symmetry, generating net body forces that steer dimers, asters, and larger assemblies toward high-activity regions. Including temporal stochasticity softens the chains, allowing them to bend and wind around other filaments. Once several contacts are established, steric interlocking arrests relative motion and stabilizes the assembly into a hierarchically entangled cluster. These clusters persist for times far exceeding single-chain relaxation and do not appear under deterministic, temporally constant activity. Remarkably, such activity-induced gelation occurs even at polymer concentrations substantially lower than those typically required for passive chains. Our results reveal a new mechanism for activity-induced aggregation, providing new strategies for designing autonomous and reconfigurable microfluidic systems."

It was found that a Ta seed-layer suppresses the net spin moment on the Mn ions, leading to a reduction of the MAE."

      "summary": "Magnetism and spin physics are true quantum mechanical effects and their description usually requires multi reference methods and is often hidden in the standard description of molecules in quantum chemistry. In this work we present a twofold approach to the description of spin physics in molecules and solids. First, we present a method that identifies the single-particle basis in which a given subset of the orbitals is equivalent to spin degrees of freedom for models and materials which feature significant spin physics at low energies. We introduce a metric for the spin-like character of a basis orbital, of which the optimization yields the basis containing the optimum spin-like basis orbitals. Second, we demonstrate an extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation method to derive the effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of the Hilbert space in which the charge degree of freedom of electron densities in the spin-like orbitals is integrated out. The method then yields an effective Hamiltonian describing spins coupled to a fermionic environment. This extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is applicable to a wide range of Hamiltonians and has been utilized in this work for model Hamiltonians as well as the Hamiltonian describing the active orbital space of molecular chromium bromide. This is achieved by reformulating the highly non-linear Schrieffer-Wolff equations into a linear set of equations corresponding to an operator basis."

      "summary": "Active matter refers to a broad class of non-equilibrium systems where energy is continuously injected at the level of individual ``particles\". These systems exhibit emergent collective behaviors that have no direct thermal-equilibrium counterpart. Their scale ranges from micrometer-sized swarms of bacteria to meter-scale human crowds. In recent years, the role of topology and self-propelled topological defects in active systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in polar and nematic active matter. Building on these ideas, we investigate emergent collective dynamics in apolar active granular fluids. Using isotropic granular vibrators as a model experimental system of apolar active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles in a dry environment, we uncover a distinctive three-stage time evolution arising from the intricate interplay between activity and inelastic interactions. By analyzing the statistics, spatial correlations, and dynamics of vortex-like topological defects in the displacement vector field, we demonstrate their ability to describe this intrinsic collective motion. Furthermore, associated to these topological defects, we reveal the onset of a turbulent-like inverse energy cascade, where kinetic energy transfers across different length scales over time. As the system evolves, the power scaling of the energy transfer increases with the duration of observation. Our findings show that topological concepts can be extended to the nonequilibrium dynamics of apolar active matter, revealing a direct link between microscopic topological processes and emergent large-scale behaviors in active granular fluids that lack both a well-defined direction of motion and an intrinsic axis of orientation at the particle scale."

      "summary": "Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. This diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks."

      "summary": "The concept of a `persistent worm' is introduced, representing the smallest possible length of a wormlike micelle, and modelled by a bead-spring chain with sticky beads at the ends. Persistent worms are allowed to combine with each other at their sticky ends to form wormlike micelles with a distribution of lengths, and the semiflexibility of a wormlike micelle is captured with a bending potential between springs, both within and across persistent worms that stick to each other. Multi-particle Brownian dynamics simulations of such polydisperse and `polyflexible' wormlike micelles, with hydrodynamic interactions included and coupled with reversible scission/fusion of persistent worms, are used to investigate the static and dynamic properties of wormlike micellar solutions in the dilute and unentangled semidilute concentration regimes. The influence of the sticker energy and persistent worm concentration are examined and simulations are shown to validate theoretical mean-field predictions of the universal scaling with concentration of the chain length distribution of linear wormlike micelles, independent of the sticker energy. The presence of wormlike micelles that form rings is shown not to affect the static properties of linear wormlike micelles and mean-field predictions of ring length distributions are validated. Linear viscoelastic storage and loss moduli are computed and the unique features in the intermediate frequency regime compared to those of homopolymer solutions are highlighted. The inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) enables the distinction between Rouse and Zimm dynamics in wormlike micelle solutions to be elucidated. While the neglect of HI is justified in the case of entangled wormlike micelle solutions, here the concentration at which the onset of the screening of hydrodynamic interactions occurs is clearly identified."

Our scaled devices exhibit an enhanced breakdown-to-coercive field ratio exceeding 2.6 due to increased breakdown field. The MIFM devices demonstrate stable 3-bit non-volatile multistate behavior with clearly distinguishable resistance states and retention exceeding 4*10^4 seconds at 85 C.

However little is known how to construct a fractional quantum Hall ground-state, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, that exists both in crystalline and disordered lattices and is qualitatively different to known topological phases. Here, we propose a general method for building such a phase. This is done by coupling quantum wires placed aperiodically in real-space, where the spatial positioning allows us to tune the inter-wire couplings. We call the emergent phase the Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect as it displays a rich interplay of fractional quantum Hall physics with fractonic constraints, formed by coupling differently-fractionalised wires into a globally gapped phase. The ground state has an exponential degeneracy in system size, a signature of the emergence of fractons. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), multiples of which can then hop between two wires (s-lineons) or be free to travel across the system (C-anyons), depending on the multiplicity. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires, which can be disordered. Our method provides an analytically solvable pathway to non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effects and fractonic theories in two-dimensions, examples of which were lacking."

Such states are referred to as Hall crystals. However, compared to those with integer Hall conductivities, the FQAH crystal (FQAHC) is still elusive even at the level of microscopic model. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model on triangular lattice with spinless fermions. At fractional filling of the Chern band, the nearest-neighbor interaction leads to a commensurate and topologically trivial CDW state. Interestingly, the folded mini-band above the CDW gap is non-trivial, and we focus on the doping of it without any projection. A series of (F)QAHC states at (fractional) integer fillings of this mini-band are discovered and some FQAHC state might even exist in less \"ideal\" conditions. The ground-state degeneracies of such (F)QAHC states are enlarged by the CDW degeneracy and the Hall conductivities -- determined by the fillings of the mini-band -- are different from the fillings of the original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find a compressible CDW phase at intermediate temperatures, which might serve as a precursor of lower temperature FQAHC phase. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that such a generic scheme of doping CDW-folded topological mini-band could be applied to bosonic systems, broadening the platforms of Hall-crystal physics and motivating its exploration in quantum moire and cold-atom systems."

Because both the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands have quadratic dependence on $k_{z}$ when the gap closes, we need to consider at least three subbands, i.e., the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands, in building the effective Hamiltonian. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is block diagonal and each block is a $3\\times3$ matrix. End states are found in the inverted regime when we solve the effective Hamiltonian with open boundary condition."

      "summary": "The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature."

      "summary": "Conventional treatments of Josephson junctions (JJs) are typically not current-conserving. In the mean-field BCS theory, current conservation is only guaranteed if the superconducting order parameter is treated self-consistently. We show that this requirement has significant consequences for the current-phase relation (CPR) in certain regimes, where the current density in the superconducting leads is non-negligible. To this end, we introduce a numerical method for the self-consistent treatment of the BdG equations with current conservation for quasi-1D superconductor-normal (metal)-superconductor (SNS) JJs. Our model incorporates a phase gradient of the order parameter in the leads, which is set to match the Josephson current through the weak link. We compare our method to standard, non-current-conserving approaches by calculating the CPR for SNS JJs while varying lengths and gate voltages controlling the normal metal. We show that current conservation has significant implications for the Josephson harmonics and can weaken or even reverse forward skewness of the CPR."

      "summary": "Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures."

Competition between three nonequivalent bond interactions results in various ground-state quantum phases, the exact dimer-product singlet ground state being among them. The thermodynamic properties of this model are much less understood. We used high-temperature expansion up to the $18$th order to study the thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the uniform maple-leaf lattice with the ground state exhibiting a six-sublattice $120^{\\circ}$ long-range magnetic order. Pad\\'{e} approximants allow us to get reliable results up to the temperatures of about $T\\approx 0.4$. To study thermodynamics for arbitrary temperatures, we made the interpolation using the entropy method. Based on the analysis of close Pad\\'{e} approximants, we find ground-state energy $e_{0}=-0.53064\\ldots -0.53023$ in good agreement with numerical results. The specific heat $c(T)$ has a typical maximum at rather low temperatures $T\\approx0.379$ and the uniform susceptibility $\\chi(T)$ at $T\\approx0.49$. We also estimate the value of $\\chi(T)$ at zero temperature $\\chi_{0}\\approx0.05\\ldots0.06$. The ground-state order manifests itself in the divergence of the so-called generalized Wilson ratio."

We show that the level of velocity fluctuations is higher for the high friction material, and that, once defluidized, the decrease in the coefficient of sliding friction leads to more organized (crystal-like) structures, while those with higher friction coefficients are amorphous (glass-like structures). Our results bring new insights for understanding the formation of glass- and crystal-like structures based on the material surface properties."

We derive and solve the induced Langevin-Klein-Gordon string dynamics with explicit expressions for the streaming term, friction coefficient, and noise variance. These parameters are computed exactly in a weak coupling expansion. The induced friction is a sum of two terms: one entropic, proportional to the noise variance as in the Einstein relation for a thermal equilibrium bath, and a frenetic contribution that can take both signs. The frenetic part wins for higher bath persistence, making the total friction negative, and hence creating a wave instability akin to inverse Landau damping. However, this acceleration decreases and eventually disappears when the propulsion speed of the active particles becomes much higher. Detailed simulations confirm the initial growth driven by this anti-damping."

      "summary": "Multi-domain states of square artificial spin ice show a range of different morphologies ranging from simple stripe-like domains to more organically shaped coral domains. To model the relevant dynamics leading to the emergence of such diverse domain structures, simplified descriptions of the switching behavior of individual nanomagnets are necessary. In this work, we employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the demagnetization of square artificial spin ice toward its ground state, and compare how the choice of transition barriers affect the emergence of mesoscale domains. We find that the commonly used mean-field barrier model (informed by equilibrium energetics only) results in propagation of ground-state string avalanches. In contrast, taking into account chiral barrier splitting enabled by state-dependent local torques supports the emergence of complex-shaped coral domains and their successful relaxation towards the ground state in later relaxation stages. Our results highlight that intrinsic contributions to switching barriers, in addition to the effect of extrinsic defects often attributed to nanofabrication irregularities, can subtly shift favored transition pathways and result in different emergent mesoscale features. Future kinetic Monte Carlo models that describe the evolution of artificial spin systems should thus account for these effects."

In this work, we reveal a unique type of M\\\"obius topological insulator, whose edge bands could twist around the quasienergy $\\pi$ of a periodically driven system and are thus of Floquet origin. By applying time-periodic quenches to an experimentally realized M\\\"obius insulator model, we obtain interconnected M\\\"obius edge bands around zero and $\\pi$ quasienergies, which can coexist with a gapped or gapless bulk. These M\\\"obius bands are topologically characterized by a pair of generalized winding numbers, which are integer-quantized due to an emergent chiral symmetry at a high-symmetry point in momentum space. Numerical investigations of the quasienergy and entanglement spectra provide consistent evidence for the presence of such M\\\"obius topological phases. A protocol based on the adiabatic switching of edge-band populations is further introduced to dynamically characterize the topology of Floquet M\\\"obius edge bands. Our findings thus extend the scope of M\\\"obius topological phases to nonequilibrium settings and unveil a unique class of M\\\"obius-twisted topological edge states without static counterparts."

This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation."

Remarkably, this transition is accompanied by a giant, non-monotonic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, with the Lorenz number enhanced up to $7.17\\,L_0$. This anomaly arises from a strain-sensitive hybridization between Ni-$d$ and I-$p$ orbitals, leading to spin-polarized transport channels and decoupling of heat and charge currents. These properties make NiI$_2$ a promising candidate for mechanically gated spin-caloritronic devices and thermal logic elements, where reversible control of heat and spin flow is essential.

      "summary": "We study nonlinear hydrodynamic electron transport driven by an AC electric field. In noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry the nonlinear flow of such liquids is nonreciprocal, giving rise to a DC current $I^{DC}$ that is quadratic in the amplitude of the AC electric field. This is the hydrodynamic analogue of the linear photogalvanic effect (PGE), which arises in bulk noncentrosymmetric materials with broken TR symmetry. The magnitude of $I^{DC}$ depends on both the properties of the electron fluid and the geometry of the flow, and may be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the nonreciprocity number $\\mathcal{N}$, and the frequency-dependent vibrational number $\\mathcal{R}$. Due to nonlocality of hydrodynamic transport, at low frequencies of the AC drive, $I^{DC}$ is super-extensive. The AC component of the electric current is likewise strongly affected by nonreciprocity: the hysteretic current-voltage dependence becomes skewed, which can be interpreted in terms of nonreciprocity of the memory retention time."

A striking exotic feature in collective dynamics is the two-peak shape of the current spectral functions of the single-component liquid, which makes evidence of a second branch of longitudinal propagating modes in the wave number range $k>1$\\AA$^{-1}$. It is shown that time correlation functions reflecting the out-of-phase motion of particles and their cages of nearest neighbors results in the same frequencies of the exotic low-frequency branch of vibrations.

      "summary": "High-temperature part of the phase diagram of tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets is discussed within the framework of the mean-field approach. Based on recent experimental findings, we generalize previous theoretical studies by considering a model that includes frustrated Heisenberg exchange, biquadratic exchange, magnetodipolar interaction, anisotropic exchange, and single-ion anisotropy. It is analytically demonstrated that a subtle interplay among these interactions results in a variety of phase diagrams in the temperature-magnetic field plane. We argue that one of the proposed diagrams reproduces all crucial features of the phase diagram experimentally observed for~\\gdru~compound. Besides magnetodipolar interaction and additional easy-axis contribution, it requires moderate biquadratic exchange. We show that despite the remarkable square skyrmion lattice being stable even if only magnetodipolar interaction/compass anisotropy or biquadratic exchange is included, their ``symbiosis'' allows for greatly enhancing its stability region. It is also demonstrated that higher-order harmonics play an important role in the stabilization of the square skyrmion lattice. The developed analytical approach can be useful for the refinement of the microscopic model parameters when comparing its predictions with experimental findings."

      "summary": "We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\\Gamma$ and negative $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\\Gamma^\\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials."

In such spin-lasers, the polarization of the emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies on large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly polarized emission modes. We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers."

      "summary": "Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm 2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the OFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off the transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology."

We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization."

EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1% error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems. Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model covering the periodic table.

Time reversal is achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate, which can be readily implemented in simulations and experiments to generate new synthetic data samples driven by active fluctuations. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential, which opens up new avenues to exploit fluctuations in active and living systems for generative AI purposes."

At the same time, the common misconceptions of the requirement of visiting all available states in the time-averaged quantities for physical systems and non-existence of an ergodic process are resolved by introducing the distinction between Gibbs-Boltzmann and von Neumann-Birkhoff ergodic regimes. For this purpose, we introduce a new concept which is called sufficiency of sparse visit. We use finite symbolic random sequences as a pedagogical tool in establishing the different approaches for the detection of ergodic regimes of dynamical systems with vector patterns. The simple example system conveys the different attitudes in ergodicity regimes and offers guidance for building computational tools for its algorithmic detection."

This great simplification allows for determination of optical properties from a handful of planewaves and a single transition.

      "summary": "Cadmium telluride (CdTe), lead sulfide (PbS), and indium tin oxide (ITO) play crucial roles in various electronic applications where laser treatment enables precise modification of their distinctive electronic characteristics. This study utilizes the XTANT-3 hybrid/multiscale model to investigate the microscopic response of these materials to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The model simultaneously traces intertwined processes of non-equilibrium dynamics of both electrons and atoms, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe exhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective threshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon coupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all materials exhibit nonthermal melting at higher doses. When accounting for energy dissipation pathways and material recrystallization processes, damage thresholds increase substantially. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band gap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose increases, the resulting cooled material becomes increasingly amorphous, progressively reducing the band gap until a stable configuration is reached. Notably, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibits transient superionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At 0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the surface occurs. These findings indicate that femtosecond laser technology offers promising opportunities for precise band gap engineering in various photovoltaic semiconductor devices."

      "summary": "Elastic deformations couple with electronic degrees of freedom in materials to generate gauge fields that lead to interesting transport properties. Recently, it has been well studied that strain-induced chiral magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals lead to interesting magnetotransport induced by the chiral anomaly (CA). Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a Weyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present in a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge and thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we resolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first demonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit coupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical Boltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband scattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic field can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect, whose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the angle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral anomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We further reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an external magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Ettingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional Lorentz-force-driven counterpart. In light of recent and forthcoming theoretical and experimental advances in the field of SOC-NCMs, we find our study to be particularly timely and relevant."

      "summary": "The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins using physically-motivated potentials for non-polar interactions, can identify the biologically correct assembly as the energy-minimizing state. Short-range potentials, however, produce rugged energy landscapes, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional local minimizers. Successful self-assembly simulations depend on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space. We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales. Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore, the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes."

      "summary": "We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions."

      "summary": "The study of the response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) assemblies to an external alternating magnetic field is of great interest for applications such as hyperthermia. The key quantity here is the complex susceptibility and its behavior in terms of temperature and frequency. From a theoretical point of view it can be obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with the time quantified Monte Carlo (TQMC) method if a physical time is associated with the MC step. Here we revisit this method by showing that the time unit can be derived from the MC stochastic process of the isolated particle. We first obtain a MC unit of time from the relaxation of the system at fixed temperature. Then this unit of time is used to compute complex susceptibilities. We show that it is now possible to match the TQMC results with actual experimental results regarding frequency dependent in phase susceptibilities and quantify the unit of time in seconds. Finally we show that the time unit obtained for the isolated particle remains valid when considering interacting particles such as the Heisenberg coupling or dipole dipole interactions."

      "summary": "The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explorations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four dimensional (4D) QHE has been experimentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension."

The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\\,\\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\\,\\mathrm{ \\mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\\,\\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the \"magnet on oscillator\" configuration."

      "summary": "We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures."

      "summary": "We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$. We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experimental data. Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals."

Particular attention is given to the effect of different statistical interpretations of the stochastic differential equation and to the relation between the approximations and the known, exact solutions to the one-dimensional problem. Beginning with a reasonable, but heuristic, simplifying assumption, a one-dimensional solution to the problem is developed. This is then simplified by introducing further approximations resulting in a sequence of increasingly simple expressions culminating in the classic result of Langer(Ann. Phys. 54, 258 (1969)) and others. The various approximations are tested on two dimensional problems by comparison to simulation results and it is found that the one-dimensional approximations capture most of the non-Arrhenius dependence on the energy barrier which is lost in the Langer approximation while still converging to the latter in the large-barrier limit."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors."

It is thus necessary to develop theoretical and experimental tools to explore quantum correlation in such systems to advance our understanding of many-body physics. While previous works have identified some profound aspects of quantum entanglement using e.g. entanglement entropy, there exists a critical demand to have an experimentally accessible tool to investigate many-body quantum entanglement in a broad context. We present an entanglement criterion characterizing collective entanglement in Boson lattice systems and enabling experimental observation readily. On applying our approach to the extended Bose-Hubbard model, we show that our criterion witnesses phase transitions such as Mott insulator--superfluid and Mott insulator--charge density wave transitions. Remarkably, it also makes it possible to detect multipartite entanglement among boson lattice sites in a rigorous sense. Our criterion can be experimentally tested via Raman scattering or time-of-flight methods, which are within the reach of current technology."

Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian."

By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, 8-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensemble, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities."

First, we simulate in detail the case of a trap whose one-particle spectrum is given by prime numbers. We investigate one-body Rabi oscillations and the excitation lineshape for two resonantly coupled energy levels. We also show that techniques from quantum control are effective in reducing the transition time, compared to the case of a periodic perturbation. Next, we investigate cascades of such transitions. To this end, we pose the following question: can one construct a quantum system where the existence of a continuous resonant cascade is predicted on the validity of a particular statement in number theory? We find that a one-body trap with a log-natural spectrum, parametrically driven with a perturbation of a log-natural frequency, provides such a quantum system. Here, powers of a given natural number will form a ladder of equidistant energy levels; absence of gaps in this ladder is an indication of the validity of the number theory statement in question. Ideas for two more resonance cascade experiments are presented as well: they are designed to illustrate the validity of the Diophantus-Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity (the set of sums of two squares of integers is closed under multiplication) and the validity of the Goldbach conjecture (every even number is a sum of two primes)."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions."

Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization."

Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes-highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science."

By extending the domain of the stacking theorem, we apply our theory to a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics have recently been observed in the laboratory. Our work uncovers how scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles."

Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a one-dimensional single layer placed in the middle of an optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation field. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multiple layers of two-dimensional materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a bright layer description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics in three dimensions. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayered material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder."

This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom detection fidelity of $99.96(1)\\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition.

These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Wave propagation in time-varying media enables unique control of energy transport by breaking energy conservation through temporal modulation. Among the resulting phenomena, temporal disorder-random fluctuations in material parameters-can suppress propagation and induce localization, analogous to Anderson localization. However, the statistical nature of this process remains incompletely understood. We present a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of electromagnetic wave propagation in spatially uniform media with randomly time-varying permittivity. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact moment equations and identify three distinct statistical regimes for initially unidirectional input: gamma-distributed energy at early times, negative exponential statistics at intermediate times, and a quasi-log-normal distribution at long times, distinct from the true log-normal. In contrast, symmetric bidirectional input yields genuine log-normal statistics across all time scales. These findings are validated using two complementary disorder models--delta-correlated Gaussian noise and piecewise-constant fluctuations--demonstrating that the observed statistics are robust and governed by input symmetry. Momentum conservation constrains the long-time behavior, linking the statistical outcome to the initial conditions. Our results establish a unified framework for understanding statistical wave dynamics in time-modulated systems and offer guiding principles for the design of dynamically tunable photonic and electromagnetic devices."

However, the achievable resolution of the technique is traditionally limited by the probe step size -- setting stringent Nyquist sampling requirements. At the same time, parallax imaging has emerged as a dose-efficient phase-retrieval technique which relaxes sampling requirements and enables scan-upsampling. Here, we formulate parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to part of the direct ptychography kernel and use this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. We validate our analytical results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), including center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and iterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable signal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the Poisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly overestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by recent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods."

Alimohammadi and Ahmadi previously classified 28 Yang-Baxter integrable two-particle interaction rules for the two species models with homogeneous rates. In this work, we show that 7 of these 28 cases can be naturally extended to integrable models with an arbitrary number of species $N \\geq 2$. Moreover, we discover new integrable models with one or two parameters that generalize these 7 cases. For 8 of the remaining 21 cases, we propose an alternative extension scheme that yields integrable $N$ species models."

We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \\sim \\Lambda_{\\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\\Lambda_{\\text{EM}} \\gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \\frac{3\\pi^2 m_e v}{4\\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \\Lambda_{\\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-M{\\o}ller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range. The construction is gauge invariant, behaves consistently under limiting conditions, and can be matched to experimental stopping data through a single effective normalization constant."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is fundamental for a wide range of applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 053401 (2024)], we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach [Phys. Rev. A 101, 053416 (2020)], which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice shifts and find relative frequency deviations up to $8\\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\\times10^{-18}$ level, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE. We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions. The circular Dyson Brownian motions are a typical example of stochastic log-gases. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit."

Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations."

A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies. When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets, imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot. The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter."

They demonstrate that these activities are intrinsically linked to chiral and axial-vector motifs of materials, thereby establishing a diagnostic framework for identifying space-time symmetries in complex quantum phases.
