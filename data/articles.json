This coupling leads to properties that are attractive for a number of applications in soft robotics and energy absorption. This paper is motivated by the latter application, and provides a systematic experimental study of a particular class of liquid crystal elastomers -- the isotropic genesis polydomain liquid crystal elastomers -- over a wide range of strain rates. An important aspect of this study is a novel tensile drop-tower that enables tensile strain rates of 100 s$^{-1}$ that are important to application but previously inaccessible. The paper also extends a recently proposed constitutive model to the high strain rate regime, and shows that it can be fit to describe the observed behavior across the spectrum of examined behavior."

Although traditionally regarded as distinct, both features are increasingly recognized as sharing a common physical origin. In a recent work, G. Ding et al. (Nat. Phys. 2025) propose a resonant-damping model that unifies these anomalies within a single framework. By coupling phonon damping to vibrational softening, their theory explains why some materials exhibit van Hove peaks, others boson peaks, and many show both. This advance extends earlier ideas and theories of Baggioli and Zaccone on the competition between phonon propagation and damping, while also connecting to microscopic mechanisms such as nonaffine motions in glasses. The resonant-damping paradigm thus offers a promising step toward a unified understanding of vibrational anomalies across ordered and disordered solids."

Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $\\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large."

      "summary": "Liquids in hydrophilic pores of nanoscale dimensions have capillary pressures so large that they can theoretically climb several kilometers against gravity. But droplets deposited on thin nanoporous layers form imbibition fronts that stop advancing at typically a fraction of a millimeter, because of evaporation. Recently, there has been growing interest in such droplet infiltration dynamics, either as a way to study the behavior of confined fluids, or in connection with applications e.g. in water harvesting, printing, chemical delivery, actuating, sensing, etc. Here, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the spontaneous imbibition and evaporation of sessile liquid droplets into a thin porous layer with pores of nanometric dimensions (mesopores) and its dependency on the imposed relative humidity (RH). Theoretically, we provide a unified analytical approach to describe the dynamics of the imbibition annulus (halo), which corrects for a neglected coupling between imbibition and evaporation fluxes, describes halos of arbitrary dimensions with respect to droplet size, and incorporates confinement-induced thermodynamic shifts (Kelvin effect). Experimentally, we show that the timescales of halo formation diverge at a critical RH, due to the Kelvin effect. Our analysis also shows an apparent divergence of the imbibition coefficient, which cannot be explained by standard capillary models. This observation suggests an important role of vapor transport and condensation along the porous surface. Globally, our results indicate that droplet infiltration in porous layers involve complex couplings, and that one should be cautious when interpreting halo dynamics data. Our study also suggests RH as a powerful control parameter for tuning droplet imbibition behavior and infiltration patterns."

      "summary": "A multichannel Kondo system, where a single quantum spin couples to multiple channels of an electronic bath, provides one of the simplest examples of a zero-dimensional non-Fermi liquid. It is natural to ask: what happens when an extensive number of such systems are coupled together? A simple renormalization group argument implies that in a chain of SU(N) multichannel quantum systems, where each spin is coupled to its own bath of K channels, the individual spins dynamically decouple at low energy when N>K, resulting in a 'sliding' non-Fermi liquid. Using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we find evidences of a continuous, 'dimensionality-changing' phase transition out of this non-Fermi liquid into a valence-bond solid phase as the intersite coupling is increased. Remarkably, at the critical point, correlations exhibit a power-law behavior even along the direction in which the spins are coupled, indicating the breakdown of dynamical decoupling at the transition. We also develop an RG scheme to understand the universal aspects of this transition."

      "summary": "Analyzing the consequences of the quantum geometry induced by the momentum dependence of Bloch states has emerged as a very rich and active field in condensed matter physics. For instance, for the superfluid stiffness or the pairing mechanism, these geometric aspects can play an important role. We here demonstrate that quantum geometry can also be essential for the disorder sensitivity of a superconductor, in particular when time-reversal symmetry is broken in the normal-state Bloch Hamiltonian. We derive a general expression for the behavior of the critical temperature $T_c$ involving weighted (anti-)commutators of the superconducting order parameter and impurity matrix elements, which includes both wave-function effects and kinetic pair breaking due to broken time-reversal symmetry in the dispersion. We analyze how the former effects lead to \"quantum geometric pair breaking\", where any superconductor becomes susceptible to microscopically non-magnetic impurities, and formally relate it to the maximum possible localization of two-particle Wannier states. Further, in the presence of kinetic pair breaking, impurities can also enhance pairing, leading to an overall more complex, non-monotonic behavior of $T_c$ with impurity concentration. We also analyze the fate of finite-momentum pairing. Our results are directly relevant to rhombohedral graphene, twisted MoTe$_2$, and superconducting altermagnets."

At $t=0$ the probe and the bath are in equilibrium at temperature $T_P$ and $T_B$, respectively. We show that for times $t$ and $s$ of the order of $N$, $C_{\\alpha,N}(s,t)$ is very well approximated by its limit $C_{\\alpha}(s,t)$ as $N\\to\\infty$. We find that, if the frequency $\\Omega$ of the probe is in the spectrum of the bath, the system appears to thermalize, at least at higher order in $\\alpha$. This means that, at order 0 in $\\alpha$, $C_\\alpha(s,t)$ equals the correlation of a probe in contact with an ideal stochastic {\\it thermostat}, that is forced by a white noise and subject to dissipation. In particular we find that $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} C_\\alpha(t,t)=T_B/\\Omega^2$ while that $\\lim_{\\tau\\to\\infty} C_\\alpha(\\tau,\\tau+t)$ exists and decays exponentially in $t$.

That is, even when the bath is very large, it cannot be thought of as a stochastic thermostat. When the frequency of the bath is far from the spectrum of the bath, no thermalization is observed."

      "summary": "We explore quantum localization phenomena in a system of two coupled tight-binding chains with incommensurate periods. Employing the inverse participation ratio as a measure of localization, we investigate the effects of geometric incommensurability and external magnetic fields. Numerical results reveal the existence of a mobility edge in the spectrum characterized by an abrupt onset of localization in higher-energy states. We find that localization tends to be enhanced by a weak magnetic field, whereas a strong field delocalizes most states."

      "summary": "The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors."

      "summary": "Nematic liquid crystal is a complex fluid whose constituents have an anisotropic shape and exhibit orientational order. A class of active matter which exhibits orientational order, e.g., cell populations, is called active nematic. A singularity of the orientational field, called a topological defect, is a robust structure which cannot be removed by continuum deformations. This robustness plays an important role in, e.g., the process of morphogenesis. To enhance the understanding of the behavior of active nematic, it is important to understand the behavior of topological defects. In this paper, we study the configuration of topological defects of a two-dimensional active nematic around a circular obstacle. In the case of a passive nematic liquid crystal, the equilibrium configuration of defects can be easily identified by the method of image charges. In the case of an active nematic, however, one must take account of the flow field generated by active constituents, and the problem of identifying the defect configuration becomes complicated. In this study, we perform numerical simulations and investigate how the stationary defect configuration deviates from the passive case. Furthermore, we carry out a theoretical calculation based on an analytical expression relating the defect velocity with the force exerted on the defect. Our theoretical calculation qualitatively reproduces the simulation results. Our study may be applied to describing the behaviour of e.g. cell populations in the presence of obstacles, and has the potential to benefit related fields, e.g., developmental biology."

      "summary": "This first-principles study investigates the structural, electronic, lattice dynamical properties, and electron-phonon coupling in ferromagnetic cubic B20 FeGe under applied pressure. The implemented spin-scaling exchange-correlation (ssxc) approach allowed to modify the magnetic moment and ferromagnetic phase energetics using a single scaling parameter, thereby yielding an adjustment of the critical pressure ($p_c$) to its experimental value. The ssxc scheme resulted in a subtle energy shift of the electronic bands in the spin-up channel, and reduced the magnetic moment, bringing it closer to the experimentally reported value. Application of the ssxc approach to phonon dispersion and electron-phonon interaction resulted in a slight mitigation of the pronounced softening and large linewidths of the lowest-frequency acoustic branch close to the $R$-point, typically observed with standard DFT calculations. With increasing pressure, phonon anomaly and linewidths diminish significantly and practically disappear at $p_c$ and beyond. This trend parallels the pressure dependence of the magnetic moment. A comparative analysis of the electronic joint density of states with the phonon linewidths revealed that the momentum dependence of linewidths around the $R$-point closely follow the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon matrix elements. This indicates that the correlation between magnetic moment and linewidths under applied pressure originates from the electron-phonon matrix elements, presenting a distinct scenario compared to other B20 family members, where nesting plays a more dominating role."

      "summary": "Tantalum (Ta) has recently emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which is believed to host fewer two-level system (TLS) defects key $-$ contributors to decoherence in superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide (AlO$_x$) remains the predominant choice for Josephson junction barriers in most qubit architectures. In this study, we systematically investigate various techniques for forming high-quality oxide layers on $\\alpha$-phase tantalum ($\\alpha$-Ta) thin films, aiming to develop effective Josephson junction barriers. We explore thermal oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, as well as plasma oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, and propose a mechanistic picture of the underlying oxidation mechanisms. All methods yield Ta$_2$O$_5$, the same compound as tantalum's native oxide. Among these, plasma oxidation produces the smoothest and highest-quality oxide layers, making it particularly well-suited for Josephson junction fabrication. Furthermore, we demonstrate the successful epitaxial growth of $\\alpha$-Ta atop oxidized $\\alpha$-Ta films, paving the way for the realization of trilayer Ta/Ta-O/Ta Josephson junctions with clean, low-loss interfaces."

      "summary": "We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\\it classical} circuit model. We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy, providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime."

However, Pareto-optimal solutions do not necessarily satisfy all minimum performance thresholds required for practical deployment. An alternative approach is to treat alloy design as a constraint satisfaction problem, in which the goal is to identify any solution that meets all bare minimum requirements across multiple quantities of interest. These approaches have yet to be benchmarked against each other in the context of realistic alloy design problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, in realistic alloy design campaigns involving multiple objectives and constraints, the constraint satisfaction framework yields a higher likelihood of finding viable alloys than optimization-based approaches. Furthermore, constraint-satisfaction approaches find the first viable alloy solutions earlier than optimization. Our results suggest that focusing on feasibility rather than optimality can lead to more actionable outcomes in materials discovery, particularly in highly constrained applications."

      "summary": "The missing first Shapiro step in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions has been widely interpreted as a hallmark of Majorana bound states. However, conventional mechanisms like junction underdamping or Joule heating can produce similar signatures. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsic non-linear current-voltage characteristic of low-to-moderate transparency junctions can also suppress the first step, accompanied by distinctive zigzag boundaries between the zeroth and first step at intermediate driving frequencies. Microwave measurements on Al/WTe2 junctions and numerical simulations of a non-linear resistively and capacitively shunted junction model reveal the first step collapse induced by switching jumps of current, together with zigzag features absent in scenarios solely driven by finite \\b{eta} or Joule heating. This zigzag signature therefore provides a crucial diagnostic tool, emphasizing the necessity of comprehensive analysis of microwave spectra before attributing the absence of the first Shapiro step to Majorana physics."

Designing spin textures to achieve strong and distinct electrical responses remains a significant challenge. Layered transition metal dichalcogenides offer a versatile platform for tailoring structural and magnetic properties, enabling access to a wide spectrum of topological magnetic states. Here, we report a domain-wall-driven, large, and tunable topological Hall effect (THE) in a non-centrosymmetric intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides series Fe$_x$TaS$_2$. By systematically varying the Fe intercalation level, we exert precise control over the magnetic ground states, allowing manipulation of the topological Hall effect. Real-space magnetic force microscopy (MFM) provides direct evidence of periodic magnetic stripe domain formation, confirming the microscopic origin of the observed topological transport phenomena. Our findings establish a promising way for tuning the topology of domains to generate substantial electromagnetic responses in layered magnetic materials."

B 111, 125157 (2025)}], and it has been demonstrated that the renormalization effect generated by strong correlations counterintuitively changes the nature of dissipation into an emergent many-body dissipation that causes a Kondo breakdown. In a closely related context, it is also known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo breakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson impurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model that provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo breakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact Bethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson mean-field theory. Finally, we point out that the Lehmann representation for the non-Hermitian Green function cannot be obtained by the analytic continuation to the complex energy upon the Kondo breakdown, where the analyticity of the non-Hermitian Green function in the half-complex-$\\omega$ plane no longer holds."

      "summary": "A field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) state is an extraordinary phenomenon, hitherto unobserved in metallic frustrated compounds. Recent bulk measurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic frustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states, potentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed microscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed the transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$\\mu$SR) technique, applying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline CePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $\\mu$SR data indicate that field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$ exhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B>$B_{c2}$ they yield contrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate ($\\lambda_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with an indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature independent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical spin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Furthermore, at 4.3 T, a non-Fermi liquid state is observed where frustration is absent. This comprehensive microscopic study strongly suggests the existence of a CSL state in a metallic frustrated system."

Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to show that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy at the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at $L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening. Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the opposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the driving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process similar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides."

In these systems, the first- and second-order anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole by coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of higher-order-symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$ symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice."

In this review, we provide a concise overview of non-relativistic spin splitting in compensated antiferromagnets with various spin configurations, including collinear, coplanar, and non-coplanar spin arrangements.

      "summary": "Inspired by the Kadanoff transformation in the standard renormalization group theory, we propose a temporal renormalization scheme. A Boltzmann factor that explicitly depends on the renormalized timescale is constructed, permitting thermodynamic quantities to be evaluated self-consistently across different timescales. By applying the scheme to the long-time dynamics of supercooled liquids, we uncover critical-like behaviors of supercooled liquid with three characteristic renormalization timescales: At the first timescale s_{\\alpha}, the system appears to be \"thermodynamically frozen\", i.e., the energy fluctuation becomes temperature-independent throughout the supercooled regime. At the second timescale s_{\\beta}, the third-order moment of energy distribution reaches a maximum, and s_{\\beta} is nearly temperature-independent. At the third timescale s_{\\gamma}, the third-order moment of energy distribution passes through a minimum, and s_{\\gamma} diverges as a power law s_{\\gamma}=(T-T_{c})^(-{\\gamma}). The scaling relations may reveal an intrinsic behavior in supercooled liquids, highlighting their unique feature. The current findings also demonstrate that temporal renormalization provides a powerful lens for investigating the timescale-specific dynamics."

      "summary": "Rectification properties of semiconductor p-n junction diodes are the basic and important characteristics for electronic device evaluation, especially for novel semiconductor materials. Today's semiconductor devices' fabrication and integration processes require multibillion-dollar investments and are desired to be reduced or simplified. Therefore, low-cost and non-toxic base metal materials with simple fabrication methods are desired for the future semiconductor industry. Recently, copper-based sulfides have been studied for semiconductor devices such as thermoelectric, photovoltaic, or water-splitting applications. Here, a highly rectifying p-n diode of a cubic (disordered) phase Cu4Fe5S8 polycrystal with a zincblende-like structure fabricated by a simple/low-cost wet process is shown. It is found that the Cu4Fe5S8 diode shows the highest rectification ratio in the order of 106 with a large forward current density of 15 Acm-2 (@1.5 V forward bias) at room temperature among the other compounds of copper iron sulfide devices. This remarkable and stable diode characteristic obtained by the p-type layer anodically grown on the sintered n-type cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 can bring the industry closer to low-cost semiconductor manufacturing. These results open a platform of novel semiconductor materials such as cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 with further superior crystal growth and conductive characteristics."

      "summary": "Wave transport in complex media is determined by the nature of quasimodes at the microscopic level. In three dimensional disordered media, waves generally undergo a phase transition from diffusion to Anderson localization, characterized by exponentially localized modes. A remarkable exception are electromagnetic waves, whose vector-like nature prevents Anderson localization to occur. Here we demonstrate that both scalar and vector (electromagnetic) waves exhibit a non-ergodic extended phase characterized by fractal quasimodes, for a broad range of disorder strengths. While electromagnetic waves remain in the non-ergodic extended phase at high disorder strength, scalar waves eventually enter a localized regime. These results pave the way for the engineering of anomalous wave transport phenomena in disordered media without spatial correlations."

      "summary": "The origin of the strange metallic behavior observed in a wide range of quantum materials is an open challenge to condensed matter physics. Historically, strange metals were uniquely associated with antiferromagnetic quantum critical points (QCPs), but a new generation of materials reveals their association with uniform order parameters, such as ferromagnetism, valley or nematic order, suggesting a deeper common denominator. At a QCP, order parameter fluctuations are characterized by the dynamical critical exponent $z$, which quantifies the space-time scaling asymmetry. Here, we report the observation of a divergence in the Gr\\\"uneisen ratio at the QCP of the strange-metal ferromagnet CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ with a dynamical critical exponent $z=3$, signaling that the underlying quantum singularity involves a conserved degree of freedom. Yet the magnetization of this easy-plane ferromagnet is not conserved. We argue that the $z=3$ strange criticality requires a description beyond the Landau paradigm, proposing a link with the gauge modes of the small-to-large Fermi surface transition and the associated gauge charge of the delocalizing heavy electrons."

The starting point is a closed kinetic equation for the distribution function that takes into account the effects of the confinement and that is valid in the low-density limit. From it, the Boltzmann-Lorentz equation that describes the dynamics of some tagged particles when the whole system is in equilibrium is derived. An equation that describes the diffusion in the directions parallel to the walls is deduced by applying the Zwanzig-Mori projection technique to the Boltzmann-Lorentz equation, obtaining an explicit expression for the self-diffusion coefficient that depends on the height of the system. A very good agreement between its theoretical prediction and Molecular Dynamics simulation results is obtained for the whole range of heights."

      "summary": "Determining critical points of phase transitions from partial data is essential to avoid abrupt system collapses and reducing experimental or computational costs. However, the complex physical systems and phase transition phenomena have long hindered the development of unified approaches applicable to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions. In this work, we propose predictive indicators to determine critical points in equilibrium and nonequilibrium magnetic systems based on frequency-dependent response function. For equilibrium phase transition, such as magnetization switching under magnetic field, the static magnetization response function to a perturbing magnetic field diverges at the critical field, serving as a noise-resilient predictive indicator that also reflects the transition order and critical exponents. In contrast, for nonequilibrium phase transition, such as magnetization switching driven by spin-transfer torque, static response fails to signal criticality. Instead, the dynamic response at ferromagnetic resonance frequency diverges at the critical point, which is also robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate that these static and dynamic indicators can be unified in the frame of first-order linear differential systems, offering a generalizable strategy for predicting criticality in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium transitions."

Here we report a new type of self-poisoning found in poly(lactic acid) (PLA), where a less stable crystal form (alpha') disturbs growth of the stable form (alpha). While alpha requires strict up-down order of the polar chains, alpha' does not, hence is kinetically favoured. Unexpectedly, below the temperature of the growth rate minimum the lamellar thickness increases rather than drops, as in all other reported cases of polymer crystallization with decreasing temperature. A growth rate equation model is developed, giving good match with experiments, but revealing an unexpectedly low fold surface free energy of alpha' form. Due to SP of alpha, most practical fast-cooling processing gives the low-modulus alpha'-form grown close to Tg, explaining generally poor mechanical properties of the bio-friendly PLA."

However, s-d band hybridization has been observed in both elemental Ca and compounds by manipulating thermodynamic conditions. Here, we reveal that the Ca 3d-band can even capture electrons from halogen atoms under pressure, exhibiting anionic behaviors in iodides. We predict a CsCl-type monovalent CaI at above 50 GPa by employing first-principles structural searching and successfully identified the phase at 84 GPa using in situ X-ray diffraction. We further reveal that, due to the effect of orbital broadening, unusual charge transfer from the 5p orbitals of I to the 3d orbitals of Ca in CaI, gradually reverses the ionicity of Ca and becomes the anionic ICa at 485 GPa. Multivalent Ca stabilizes a set of metallic iodides with eight- to ten-fold iodine hyper-coordination. Our findings demonstrate that the valence states of Ca can vary from negative to +2, suggesting much greater complexity of Ca chemistry under ultrahigh pressures."

In this work, we study the diffusion of Br vacancies on a Si(100)-2$\\times$1-Br surface in an STM under typical imaging conditions. In agreement with previous work, Br vacancies diffuse at a positive sample bias voltage. Here, we demonstrated that only vacancies containing a positively charged DB hop across the two atoms of a single Si dimer, while vacancies containing neutral and negatively charged DBs do not. Calculations based on the density functional theory confirmed that positively charged Br (and Cl) vacancies have a minimum activation barrier. We propose that diffusion operates by both one-electron and two-electron mechanisms depending on the applied voltage. Our results show that the DB charge has a critical effect on the vacancy diffusion. This effect should be taken into account when imaging surface structures with charged DBs, as well as when studying the diffusion of other atoms and molecules on the Si(100) surface with vacancies in an adsorbate layer."

The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\\sim$ 77 K temperature window."

The correlation coefficient matrix and k-means cluster analysis of infra-red spectra are tested for detection of phase transitions. The density-functional theory calculations are carried out for interpretation of experimental infra-red spectra. The performance of various basis sets and exchange-correlation functionals is compared, including both agreement of scaled calculated band positions with experimental values and computational time. The inter-molecular interactions in the crystal phase are inferred from the experimental IR spectra and density-functional theory calculations for dimers in head-to-head and head-to-tail configurations. The experimental temperature dependence of the C=O stretching band suggests that the head-to-tail configuration in a crystal phase is more likely.

In contrast, obtaining 2D images, such as from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), is more accessible, though typically providing insufficient information to accurately characterize the 3D microstructure. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that predicts the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images. The presented method utilizes a low-parametric 3D model from stochastic geometry to generate a large number of virtual 3D microstructures and employs a physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain the corresponding 2D SEM images. By systematically varying the underlying model parameters, a large dataset can be generated to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By doing so, we can statistically reconstruct the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images by drawing realizations from the stochastic 3D model using the predicted model parameters. In addition, we conducted an error analysis on key geometrical descriptors to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of this stereological prediction tool."

      "summary": "Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enables element-specific measurement of spin and orbital magnetic moments, analogous to X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). While the EMCD technique offers unmatched spatial resolution, its quantitative accuracy remains under scrutiny, particularly in beam-splitter geometries with convergent probes. Here, we systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative EMCD analysis using the first-order magnetostructural transition in the functional phase-change material FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference. Unlike previous EMCD studies primarily focused on elemental ferromagnets such as Fe, we demonstrate its applicability to a correlated material exhibiting coupled structural and magnetic order. We demonstrate that the extracted orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\\text{L}/m_\\text{S}$) remains consistent with XMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, thereby establishing the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, we observe an enhanced $m_\\text{L}/m_\\text{S}$, which we attribute to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale heterogeneity within the probed volume. Our results confirm that EMCD provides quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions, while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments in functional magnetic materials, and allowing the study of interfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism that is inaccessible to photon-based methods."

      "summary": "Nickel based superalloys display outstanding properties such as excellent creep strength, remarkable fracture toughness parameters, and corrosion resistance. For this reason, Ni based materials are considered as materials dedicated to the IV generation of nuclear reactors. Although these materials seem promising candidates, their radiation resistance and impact of radiation damage on the deformation mechanism are still not fully understood. In this work, two commercially available nickel based alloys, Hastelloy X and Haynes 230, were investigated. Structural and mechanical properties have been described by means of SEM and EBSD, TEM, and nanoindentation tests. Radiation damage has been performed by Ar ion with energy 320keV with two doses up to 12dpa. Obtained results have revealed a hardening effect for both levels of damage. However, more intensive effects were observed for Hastelloy X. Moreover, a significant change in precipitates morphology in Hastelloy X has been observed. It has been proposed that structural differences between both alloys determine the type of occurring radiation induced processes. Excess energy deposited into materials structure during ion irradiation can lower the temperature of nucleation of high temperature phases, which initiates the formation of grain boundary serrations."

Topological superconductors with separated Majorana bound states (MBSs) provide a strong form of protection that only depends on the locality of perturbations. While the link between MBS separation, robust degeneracy, and protected braiding is well understood in non-interacting systems, recent experimental progress in short quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains highlights the need to establish these connections rigorously for interacting systems. We do this by defining MBSs from many-body ground states and show how their locality constrains their coupling to an environment. This, in turn, quantifies the protection of the energy degeneracy and the feasibility of non-abelian braiding."

Applying this approach to a one-dimensional quasiperiodic model, a stringent test case due to its fractal energy spectrum, we find a clear distinction between the broad singularity spectra $f\\left(\\alpha\\right)$ of critical states and the point-like spectra of extended states.

      "summary": "We investigate electron transport and phase-breaking processes in thin titanium nitride (TiN) films of epitaxial quality. Previous studies show that a minute surface magnetic disorder significantly reduces the critical temperature ($T_\\mathrm{c}$) and broadens the superconducting transition as the film thickness and device size decrease. We measure electron dephasing rates via magnetoresistance from $T_\\mathrm{c}$ to $\\sim 4T_\\mathrm{c}$ in various-thickness TiN films. Electron dephasing occurs on the picosecond timescale and is nearly independent of temperature, differing from the expected inelastic scattering due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions near $T_\\mathrm{c}$, which occur over a nanosecond timescale. We propose spin-flip scattering as a possible additional phase-breaking mechanism. The significant increase in the dephasing rate for the thinnest film indicates that magnetic disorder resides near the surface of naturally oxidized films. Our research suggests that magnetic disorder may be a significant contributor to RF dissipation in superconducting devices based on TiN."

Microfluidic rotating drum experiments reveal that longer resting times lead to delayed flow onsets and reduced flow velocities, both evolving logarithmically with the resting time. These aging-like effects are more pronounced for thermally driven creep flows in piles with initial tilting angle below the athermal angle of repose, in contrast to piles initially tilted above this repose angle, where gravity-driven flows tend to gradually erase aging effects. Moreover, we show that the packing fraction does not change during the resting period, and that aging occurs in both monodisperse and polydisperse piles, indicating that crystallization is not required for the time-dependent behavior to appear. Remarkably, vigorous agitation that re-disperses the particles fully restores the piles to their initial state, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to sample degradation. These findings evidence a form of aging in quiescent suspensions intermediate between colloidal and granular media, where thermal fluctuations, still significant relative to particle weight, progressively stabilize the system, making it more resistant to flow and deformation."

Since the Peierls distortion arises from the coupling between lattice displacements and itinerant electrons, evaluating the adiabatic forces during time evolution is computationally intensive, particularly for large systems. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop a generalized Behler-Parrinello neural-network architecture -- originally formulated for ab initio molecular dynamics -- to accurately and efficiently predict forces from local structural environments. Using the locality of electronic responses, the resulting ML force field achieves linear scaling efficiency while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Large-scale dynamical simulations using this framework uncover a two-stage coarsening behavior of CDW domains: an early-time regime characterized by a power-law growth $L \\sim t^{\\alpha}$ with an effective exponent $\\alpha \\approx 0.7$, followed by a crossover to the Allen-Cahn scaling $L \\sim \\sqrt{t}$ at late times. The enhanced early-time coarsening is attributed to anisotropic domain-wall motion arising from electron-mediated directional interactions. This work demonstrates the promise of ML-based force fields for multiscale dynamical modeling of condensed-matter lattice models."

In an ordered spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, the transition metal ordering is consistently observed throughout the primary particle. However, the extent of ordering in the spinel phase depends on its distribution at the particle scale, a factor influenced by the annealing conditions.

Specifically, we investigate superlattices of the form $(\\mathrm{Ba(Os,Ir)}\\mathrm{O}_3)_n/(\\mathrm{BaTiO}_3)_4$ ($n{=}1, 2$), comprising metallic perovskite layers ($\\mathrm{BaOsO_3}$ or $\\mathrm{BaIrO_3}$) sandwiched between insulating ferroelectric $\\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$ (BTO). The ferroelectric distortion in BTO breaks inversion symmetry of the superlattice, giving rise to a finite BCD with two symmetry-allowed components of equal magnitude and opposite sign. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the magnitude of the BCD -- and consequently the nonlinear Hall response -- can be effectively tuned by varying the number of metallic layers or the choice of the B-site cation in these $\\mathrm{ABO_3}$ perovskites. Since Rashba splitting and ferroelectric distortion in these systems are readily controllable via an external electric field or strain, the non-linear Hall response in these materials can be directly engineered. Our findings establish non-centrosymmetric oxide perovskite heterostructures as a versatile platform for exploring and manipulating BCD-driven non-linear transport phenomena."

At near zero absolute temperature, atoms exhibit macroscopic phase coherence and collective quantum behavior, enabling their use in precision metrology, quantum simulation, and even information processing. This review provides an introductory overview of the key techniques used to trap, manipulate, and detect ultracold atoms, while highlighting the main applications of each method. We outline the principles of laser cooling, magnetic and optical trapping, and the most widely used techniques, including optical lattices and tweezers. Next, we discuss the manipulation methods of atomic internal and external degrees of freedom, and we present atom interferometry techniques and how to leverage and control interatomic interactions. Next, we review common ensemble detection strategies, including absorption and fluorescence imaging, state-selective readout, correlation and quantum non-demolition measurements and conclude with high-resolution approaches. This review aims to provide newcomers to the field with a broad understanding of the experimental toolkit that underpins research in ultracold atom physics and its applications across quantum science and technology."

We supplement our asymptotically exact analytical solutions for an isotropic model without warping effects by semi-numerical calculations accounting perturbatively for warping, which plays a crucial role in the low-energy band structure."

Besides the hallmark broken translational symmetry, yielding a modulated charge-density over an enlarged unit-cell with a characteristic $2{\\bf K}$ periodicity, where $\\pm {\\bf K}$ are the valley momenta, this phase lacks the three-fold ($C_3$) rotational symmetry but only for even integer $n$. The VC-CDW then represents a stripe order, as observed in hexalayer graphene [arXiv:2504.05129], but preserves the $C_3$ symmetry for odd $n$ as observed in trilayer graphene [Nat. Phys. 20, 1413 (2024) and arXiv: 2411.11163]. From a universal Clifford algebraic argument, we establish that the VC-CDW and an anomalous Hall order can lift the residual valley degeneracy of an antiferromagnetically ordered spin-polarized half-metal, when these systems are subject to perpendicular displacement fields, with only the latter one displaying a hysteresis in off-diagonal resistivity, as observed in all the systems with $2 \\leq n \\leq 6$. We showcase a confluence of VC-CDW and anomalous Hall orders within the quarter-metal, generically displaying a regime of coexistence, separating the pure phases."

Locally resolved absorption depletion, observed through differential ground state absorption imaging of a $^{87}\\text{Rb}$ cloud in presence and absence of pre-excited Rydberg atoms, reveals their projected two-dimensional distribution. By employing a closed two-level optical transition uncoupled from the Rydberg state, the highly excited atoms are preserved during imaging. We measure the excitation dynamics of the $\\vert48S\\rangle$ state of $^{87}\\text{Rb}$, observing a saturation of the two-dimensional Rydberg density. Such outcome can be explained by the Rydberg blockade effect which prevents resonant excitation of close-by Rydberg atoms due to strong dipolar interactions. By combining the superatom description, where atoms within a blockade radius are represented as collective excitations, with a Monte Carlo sampling, we can quantitatively model the observed excitation dynamics and infer the full three-dimensional distribution of Rydberg atoms, that can serve as a starting point for quantum simulation of many-body dynamics involving Rydberg spin systems."

A first cooling stage based on a blue magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 8 mK.

Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(1)\\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ uK for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms."

In this paper, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation for AFQMC and propose a novel numerical scheme to solve it. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation reveals the wavefunction actually sampled by the AFQMC algorithm. Interestingly, we find that even when the exact ground state is used as a guiding wavefunction in constrained path AFQMC, contrary to the common assumption, the wavefunction sampled by AFQMC is not exact. Beyond clarifying several fundamental aspects of AFQMC, the availability of a Fokker-Planck equation formulation opens new avenues for systematically improving its accuracy, which we outline in this paper."

Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding microbial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions at the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be homogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic understanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we introduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in biofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of the capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix heterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating the bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel cell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant 'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix arrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a substantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations during early stage biofilm development."

      "summary": "Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for realizing practical quantum computers. One requirement to create a quantum processor is nonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by sandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a Josephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that hinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum necessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead to dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for high-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations using a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator transition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit its thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link employing only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching. We utilize our weak links to produce a transmon qubit, '$planaron$', with a measured anharmonicity of $\\alpha/2\\pi = 235$ MHz; at present, the linewidth is $\\kappa/2\\pi = 15 \\mathrm{\\: MHz}$. The high superconducting gap of niobium nitride can enable operation at elevated temperatures in future devices, and the fully planar geometry of the weak link eliminates superfluous material interfaces and capacitances. The investigation of small patches of material near the SIT can shed new light on the nature of the transition, including the role of dissipation and finite-size effects."

A recent proposal encodes a protected qubit in the quasicharge degree of freedom of the conventional transmon device, here referred to as the `quasicharge qubit'. Operating such a protected qubit requires implementing new strategies. Here we show that an electronically-controllable tunnel junction formed by two topological superconductors can be used to implement single- and two-qubit gates on quasicharge qubits. Schemes for both these gates are based on dynamical $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and therefore have gate speeds of the same order. The simulation of the dynamics of a topological Josephson junction in a parameter regime with non-negligible charging energy is the key novelty of this work. We also characterize the robustness of such gate operations against charge noise using Fermi's golden rule. Our results point to a compelling strategy for implementation of quasicharge qubit gates based on junctions of minimal Kitaev chains of quantum dots."

In contrast, non-Hermitian systems exhibit complex band structures where both energy and momentum have imaginary parts, underpinning phenomena like the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence that defy conventional Bloch theory. Experimentally mapping these complex bands-relating complex momentum to complex energy-and identifying their associated eigenstates is crucial for understanding these systems but remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a non-Bloch supercell framework designed to overcome this challenge by decoupling Bloch phase control from the imaginary part of momentum. Our method combines an exponent-flattening protocol with twisted boundary conditions, enabling system-size-independent control of imaginary momentum while preserving high-resolution Bloch phase sampling. Implemented in programmable one- and two-dimensional acoustic crystals, our approach acquires momentum-resolved complex energy surfaces and biorthogonal eigenmodes by Green's function measurements.Data obtained using this framework accurately predict open-boundary spectra and eigenstates, findings we verify through separate open-geometry experiments. Our work provides a broadly applicable experimental toolkit for exploring non-Hermitian band geometry and topology in diverse engineered classical and quantum platforms."

Starting from the diffusion approximation (DA) with extrapolated (partial-current) boundary conditions, we solve the finite-slab Green's function with an isotropic internal plane source that rigorously maps external illumination to internal fluence. Using photon units for the fluence rate, Phi(z,lambda) [photons m-2 s-1], the local absorption is qa = mu_a * Phi and the primary carrier/radical generation is G = phi_int * qa. Site-limited and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics are driven by G and closed via an accessible surface per macroscopic volume, S_accessible, yielding intrinsic volumetric (per-volume) and areal (per-area) rate constants. We then specialize to air-core/silica-shell monoliths whose shells host anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs): shell refractive indices are calculated by Maxwell-Garnett/Bruggeman mixing; scattering is obtained from Mie theory (PyMieScatt); absorption follows mu_a = n_NP * sigma_abs with n_NP set by NP packing fraction in the shell. The exact slab solution reduces to a compact, design-useful predictor - our Eq. (14) - in a controlled asymptotic that clarifies when the rate scales as l*l/L (strongly diffusive, l > L). We detail measurement and validation protocols (diffuse R/T inversion of mu_s' and mu_a on the same slab, boundary extrapolation accuracy, lateral-loss control) drawing on prior art, and provide a turnkey recipe to compute rates for NP packing-fraction series. The result is a reproducible workflow that preserves design simplicity while resting on a rigorous finite-slab solution."

      "summary": "Underground storage of hydrogen and ammonia in geological formations is essential for renewable energy integration, but salt precipitation during gas injection may threaten storage performance. While extensively studied for CO2 systems, precipitation mechanisms in hydrogen-brine and ammonia-brine systems remain poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive microfluidic investigation of salt crystallization during hydrogen injection into saline and ammonia-containing brines using high-pressure microfluidics. We conducted 81 high-pressure experiments systematically varying brine composition (1-5 mol/kg NaCl), chemical additives (surfactants, alcohols, ammonia), and hydrogen flow rates (200-1300 mL/min). Quantitative image analysis reveals that hydrogen-induced precipitation differs fundamentally from CO2 systems. Hydrogen drives physical precipitation via evaporation and capillary trapping, producing discrete, localized deposits. In contrast, CO2-ammonia systems generate extensive reactive precipitation of ammonium bicarbonate with interconnected crystal networks. Interfacial tension (IFT) controls both residual brine distribution and final crystal coverage: high-IFT fluids form large, interconnected brine pools promoting extensive crystallization, while low-IFT fluids create isolated pools reducing crystal coverage by 50\\%. Alcohol and surfactant additives suppress precipitation by enhancing brine mobility, whereas ammonia paradoxically increases crystal fractions despite lower IFT. Higher flow rates accelerate crystallization across all compositions, enabling operational mitigation strategies. and demonstrate that gas-specific, rather than CO2-analog, risk assessments are essential for underground hydrogen storage design. The effectiveness of chemical additives offers promising pathways for near-wellbore protection in underground hydrogen storage operations."

      "summary": "This work aims to elucidate whether the PBF process alone (i.e., without invoking other processes like direct Urca) can explain the observed rapid cooling of Cas~A NS, by incorporating the significant uncertainties in both $q$ and the $^{3}\\text{P}_{2}$ pairing gap function into an optimization of cooling models against the Cas~A NS data. To this end, we introduce a novel parametrization of the pairing gap, in which each parameter has a direct physical meaning, and perform systematic parameter-space exploration with the BSk24 equation of state (EoS). Using a newly-developed Fortran-based cooling code coupled to Optuna's TPE algorithm, we conduct both single-objective ($\\chi^2$ only) and multi-objective ($\\chi^2$ + slope difference) optimizations under identical conditions. By optimizing the neutron $^3\\text{P}_2$ pairing gap parameters to best reproduce the Cas~A NS observational data during repeated neutron-star cooling simulations, we obtain reasonably-behaving neutron $^3\\text{P}_2$ pairing gap functions with maximum values of $\\Delta_\\text{max}\\approx$\\,0.5--0.6\\,MeV. Fixing $M=1.4\\,M_\\odot$, increasing $q$ progressively drives the optimized gap and the critical temperature $T_\\text{c}$ profiles toward smoother, more traditional shapes and improves agreement with the observational data; the PBF efficiency factor of $q\\gtrsim0.4$ reproduces the Cas~A NS slope well, whereas $q\\simeq0.19$ remains insufficient. Our results support previous indications that enhanced PBF efficiency or additional rapid-cooling channels may be required to fully explain the Cas~A NS observational data. The new parametrization not only improves interpretability but also provides a framework for future Bayesian inference and machine-learning applications. Extensions of this work will further advance the systematic study of dense-matter physics with neutron-star cooling. (Shortened due to the arXiv words limit.)"

      "summary": "Black holes exist all over our Universe, possessing a very wide range of masses. At the moment, they serve as a probe to test general relativity at astrophysical scales, but in the future they may also give us information about gravity at the microscale. Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties, such as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering black holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in statistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system, several questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be explained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these questions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored at the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this connection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved spacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged self-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of state which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes and self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase transitions between hot matter and black holes. We show the power of the formalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes. Namely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black holes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius. We construct ensembles of a self-gravitating matter thin shell, both in anti-de Sitter and in asymptotically flat spaces, in order to understand the thermodynamic features of the shell and the possible phase transitions to black hole configurations."

The key mechanism behind the complex evolution of these otherwise simple models is the so-called dynamical facilitation, a feature embedded into the models via appropriate kinetic constraints. KCMs are reversible with respect to a Bernoulli product measure, and the analysis of their stationary evolution has witnessed significant progress in the last decade. Unfortunately, in the interesting regime when the equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices is small, many fundamental questions concerning the non-stationary evolution of even the simplest models remain unsolved. In this paper, we discuss some of these questions, along with partial new results and conjectures, for the one facilitated model and its variants, as well as for the biased annihilating branching process."

In this work, we focus on the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived, including a random 2-form $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \\approx 11\\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \\approx 2\\%$ against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements, establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors. Our results constitute a substantial advance towards assessing the practical performance of 3D topological codes. This contribution is timely and in high demand, as rapid hardware advancements are bringing complex codes into experimental reach. Moreover, our work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation and holds significant interest for quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics."

      "summary": "Diffusion theory establishes a fundamental connection between stochastic differential equations and partial differential equations. The solution of a partial differential equation known as the Fokker-Planck equation describes the probability density of the stochastic process that solves a corresponding stochastic differential equation. The kinetic interpretation of noise refers to a prospective notion of stochastic integration that would connect a stochastic differential equation with a Fokker-Planck equation consistent with the Fick law of diffusion, without introducing correction terms in the drift. This work is devoted to identifying the precise conditions under which such a correspondence can occur. One of these conditions is a structural constraint on the diffusion tensor, which severely restricts its possible form and thereby renders the kinetic interpretation of noise a non-generic situation. This point is illustrated through a series of examples. Furthermore, the analysis raises additional questions, including the possibility of defining a stochastic integral inspired by numerical algorithms, the behavior of stochastic transport equations in heterogeneous media, and the development of alternative models for anomalous diffusion. All these topics are addressed using stochastic analytical tools similar to those employed to study the main problem: the existence of the kinetic interpretation of noise."

Biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been shown to buffer concentration fluctuations, but the principles governing their dynamic regulation remain unclear. We address this by probing the response of LLPS to oscillatory perturbations that mimic fluctuations across different timescales, establishing the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of concentration buffering by condensates. We find that condensates act as frequency-selective filters: the perturbed dilute phase behaves as a high-pass filter, while the dense phase attenuates both low- and high-frequency perturbations. We establish quantitative links between LLPS parameters including interaction strength, droplet size, and molecular diffusivity, and the timescale range over which condensates effectively buffer concentration fluctuations. These findings establish the fundamental dynamical limits of concentration buffering by LLPS, with implications for how cells may use LLPS to adapt to fluctuating environments and for the design of synthetic condensates with programmable control properties."

We show that device-dependent charging effects and magnetic granularity in the free layer limit the switching speed at applied voltages close to the critical switching threshold. Increasing the voltage or the applied magnetic field reduces the incubation delay and total switching time to below a few ns. Micromagnetic simulations incorporating the finite charging times of the tunnel junction and the granularity of the magnetic film reproduce the experimental results, providing critical insights into optimizing VCMA-driven magnetization control for memory and logic applications."

It is one of the simplest examples of the cyclic RG where $\\log N$ plays the role of the RG time. The deterministic model is integrable and shares the same Bethe Ansatz (BA) equations with the inhomogeneous twisted XXX spin chain. We analyze the quantum metric, the Berry curvature, and the fractal dimension in the sector with a single Cooper pair. A rich phase structure in the $(\\theta,\\gamma)$ parameter plane is found, where $\\gamma \\log N$ quantifies the hopping term. For the deterministic RDM we clearly identify the extended domain of non-ergodic multifractal phase on the $(\\theta,\\gamma)$ parameter plane supporting the reentrance transitions between the localized, ergodic, and multifractal phases. We find the pattern of phase transitions in the global charge $Q(\\theta,\\gamma)$, which arises from the BA equation. In particular, in the multifractal phase in the deterministic model $Q(\\gamma)$ exhibits the analogue of \"charge concentration\" and fortuity phenomena discussed in the context of black hole microstates at finite $N$. The BA equations in RDM exactly coincide with the equations defining the ground states in the theory on the worldvolume of the vortex strings in $N_F=2N_C$ ${\\cal N}=2$ SQCD at a strong coupling point $\\frac{1}{g_{YM}^2}=0$ with identification $\\theta_{RDM}= \\theta_{4D}-\\pi$.

Introducing skip connections facilitates signal propagation to deeper layers. In addition, previous works found that adding a scaling parameter for the residual branch further improves generalization performance. While they empirically identified a particularly beneficial range of values for this scaling parameter, the associated performance improvement and its universality across network hyperparameters yet need to be understood. For feed-forward networks, finite-size theories have led to important insights with regard to signal propagation and hyperparameter tuning. We here derive a systematic finite-size field theory for residual networks to study signal propagation and its dependence on the scaling for the residual branch. We derive analytical expressions for the response function, a measure for the network's sensitivity to inputs, and show that for deep networks the empirically found values for the scaling parameter lie within the range of maximal sensitivity. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical expression for the optimal scaling parameter that depends only weakly on other network hyperparameters, such as the weight variance, thereby explaining its universality across hyperparameters. Overall, this work provides a theoretical framework to study ResNets at finite size."

Analyzing the quantum chemistry of interacting magnetic moments in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a representative $LS$-coupled $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$ Co$^{2+}$ oxide, we find that the Kitaev and off-diagonal $\\Gamma$ interactions are substantial and antiferromagnetic but somewhat weaker than the Heisenberg contribution.

      "summary": "Elucidating fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In the context of cooling, the unattainability principle of the third law of thermodynamics asserts that infinite \"resources\" are needed to reach absolute zero. However, the precise identification of relevant resources and how they jointly constrain achievable error remains unclear within the frameworks of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics. In this work, we introduce the concept of separated states, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states, and formulate the corresponding thermokinetic cost and error, thereby establishing a unifying framework for a broad class of thermodynamic operations. We then uncover a three-way trade-off relation between time, cost, and error for thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\\tau\\mathcal{C}\\varepsilon_{\\tau}\\ge 1-\\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a pure state with a given error."

      "summary": "The numerical solution of the many-body problem of interacting electrons and ions is a key challenge in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and materials science. Traditional methods to solve the multi-component quantum Hamiltonian are usually specialized for one kind of particles -- electrons or ions -- and can suffer from a methodological gap when applied to the other ones. This work extends the self-consistent harmonic approximation, a proven successful technique for simulating quantum ions at finite temperatures in anharmonic crystals, to electrons. The approach minimizes the total free energy by optimizing an ansatz density matrix, solving a fermionic self-consistent harmonic Hamiltonian on a curved manifold parametrized through a neural network. This approach preserves an analytical expression for entropy, enabling the direct computation of free energies and phase diagrams of materials. By benchmarking this technique across several prototypical cases -- a double-well potential, the hydrogen atom, and the H$_2$ dissociation -- we demonstrate it can address both the ground- and excited-state properties of electronic systems, capture quantum tunneling and static electronic correlations, thereby providing a unified quantum framework of electrons and atomic nuclei."

      "summary": "Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves."

      "summary": "Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency {\\xi}JDL of Si largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overturns the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies."

A wealth of correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered via precise choice of stacking geometry. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry. An important open question is how atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moir\\'e geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist-untwist motion of the moir\\'e superlattice in $2^\\circ$ and $57^\\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. Upon above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moir\\'e superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of $0.6^\\circ$, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moir\\'e phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moir\\'e periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moir\\'e potential that shapes excitons, polarons, and correlation-driven behaviors"

Existing strategies present significant challenges, among which the use of multiple subunit types or the precise control of their shape and mechanics. Here we introduce an alternative approach based on identical subunits whose interactions promote crystals, but also favor crystalline defects. We theoretically show that topological restrictions on the scope of these defects in large assemblies imply that the assembly size is controlled by the magnitude of the defect-inducing interaction. Using DNA origami, we experimentally demonstrate both size and shape control in two-dimensional disk- and fiber-like assemblies. Our basic concept of defect engineering could be generalized well beyond these simple examples, and thus provide a broadly applicable scheme to control self-assembly."

      "summary": "The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles."

      "summary": "High 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices is a critical parameter to keep under control in the design of complex circuits for low temperatures applications. Current models predict the 1/f noise to scale linearly with temperature, and gate oxide defects are expected to freeze out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly observed that 1/f noise deviates from the predicted behaviour and that gate oxide defects are still active around 4.2 K, producing random telegraph noise. In this paper, we probe single gate oxide defects in 2500 nMOS devices down to 5 K in order to investigate the origin of 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices. From our results, it is clear that the number of defects active at cryogenic temperatures resulting in random telegraph noise is larger than at 300 K. Threshold voltage shifts due to charged defects are shown to be exponentially distributed, with different modalities across temperatures and biases: from monomodal at 300 K to trimodal below 100 K. The third mode is interpreted in the framework of percolation theory. By fitting these distributions, it is shown that more than 80% of the detected defects belongs to the oxide bulk. Afterwards, starting from the raw data in time domain, we reconstruct the low frequency noise spectra, highlighting the contributions of defects belonging to different branches and, therefore, to different oxide layers. This analysis shows that, although interface traps and large defects associated with the third mode are the main sources of 1/f noise at 5 K, bulk oxide defects still contribute significantly to low-frequency noise at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that defect time constants and step heights are uncorrelated, proving that elastic tunnelling model for charge trapping is not accurate."

      "summary": "Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. Moreover, this phenomenon has been never tested across a continuous glass transition between a liquid phase and a glassy state with large but finite viscosity. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap opens continuously at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. By extracting the instantaneous shear velocity from the experimental data, we uncover a shear relaxation time exhibiting a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence characteristic of glass-forming materials, accurately described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation. Our results confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework and highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases."

However, there are key differences in that the compressed state is expected to behave like a lower dimensional system, which is not the case when the force pushes only on the endpoint of the polymer. We use scaling arguments to predict the exponents both of those associated with the phase transition and those in the compressed state and find good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations."

The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states."

The recrystallization of the amorphous phase at the operation conditions of the memories occurs in the supercooled liquid phase above the glass transition temperature $T_g$. The dynamics of the supercooled liquid is thus of great relevance for the operation of the devices and, close to $T_g$, also for the structural relaxations of the glass that affect the performances of the memories. Information on the atomic dynamics is provided by the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and by the viscosity ($\\eta$) which are, however, both difficult to be measured experimentally at the operation conditions of the devices due to the fast crystallization. In this work, we leverage a machine learning interatomic potential for the flagship phase change compound compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ to compute $\\eta$, $D$ and the $\\alpha$-relaxation time in a wide temperature range from 1200 K to about 100 K above $T_g$. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations allowed quantifying the fragility of the liquid and the occurrence of a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation between $\\eta$ and $D$ in the supercooled phase. Isoconfigurational analysis provided a visualization of the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities responsible for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation.

Through the bulk-boundary correspondence, these topological phases have a one-to-one correspondence to topological edge states, which are robust to certain classes of disorder. For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the computation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however, in multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce the unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk topological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically to evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large number of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all topological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants, such as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments, we determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like configuration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave certain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending on their symmetry properties. Our approach is illustrated using different one-dimensional models, providing a robust framework for understanding topological properties in one-dimensional systems."

      "summary": "In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility."

      "summary": "Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they represent exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state (PEPS), emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents of a $q$-deformation phase transition."

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG."

However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered termination with a varying density of surface tin vacancies. This work establishes heuristics for identifying variable surface disorder using photoemission, an important prerequisite to experimentally establishing the behavior of momentum-space topological surface features subject to variable surface disorder on a single cleave."

      "summary": "We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \\textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker."

Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains."

Here we demonstrate a novel optical CV technique called Opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter ($(100 \\text{~nm})^{3}$). This technique uses total internal reflection (TIR) illumination, Electric-double-layer modulation, cyclic voltammetry, and lock-in detection, to probe ion dynamics inside nanoholes. We applied this method to study EDL (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol (Fc(MeOH)$_2$) redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Butler-Volmer (PNP-BV) model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast. This work opens up opportunities for high-sensitivity, label-free analysis of electrochemical reactions in nanoconfined environments, with potential applications in pure nanocrystal growth and monitoring, and potentially single-molecule electrochemistry."

In this work, we highlight advances in modeling local disorder using polymorphous and anharmonic frameworks, showing how these methods explain experimental observations and predict new trends. We emphasize the role of disorder in the breakdown of the phonon quasiparticle picture and in modulating electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions, particularly in soft, anharmonic phases of matter, with significant effects on electrical and thermal transport. We outline opportunities for integrating these insights into predictive modeling for energy materials and propose combining advanced first-principles methods with machine learning."

Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point.

We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order.

Although equilibration is expected in this setting because the TPQ state already encodes the thermal expectation values of all conserved quantities, the approach to equilibrium shows highly nontrivial coherent dynamics. In the spin-1/2 XX chain, local observables become stationary at their thermal values after dephasing, while the entanglement entropy exhibits a characteristic double-plateau structure. We obtain this behavior exactly using three complementary approaches: two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theory (CFT) on the Klein bottle, an exact numerical evolution based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. These results demonstrate that the non-monotonic entanglement evolution is a macroscopic manifestation of the coherent dephasing of anomalous pairing correlations in the initial TPQ state."

      "summary": "This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications."

Their Janus counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive, and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational \"Raman digital twin\" library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and experimental validation."

In this work, we conducted device transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary semiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The results demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still exhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and surpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve the required on-state current of 900 {\\mu}A/{\\mu}m under low operating voltages of 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's subthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching an astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor performance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the channel length is 7 nm. Our research not only showcases the exceptional transistor properties of Na2LiAlP2 but also further expands the research scope of 2D high-performance transistors."

      "summary": "Electronic devices are engineered at increasingly smaller length scales; new metrologies to understand nanoscale thermodynamics are needed. Temperature and pressure are fundamental thermodynamic quantities whose nanoscale measurement is challenging as physical contact inevitably perturbs the system. Here we demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures. KDTh detects local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline samples by precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). We map lattice parameters and temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe across the sample. Our parameter precision is ~0.01% and our temperature sensitivity is 2.2 K/$\\sqrt{Hz}$. KDTh offers advanced sensitivity by fitting the entire Kikuchi pattern, even beyond the precision measured in transmission electron microscopy. KDTh can operate in both transmission (transmission Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD) modes."

      "summary": "Active transport of biomolecular condensates and cell migration in collectives are fundamental to development, homeostasis, and processes such as cancer progression, wound healing, and infection response. Yet how these assemblies are positioned, regulated, and driven through cycles of dissolution and reassembly is not fully understood. We address this using a model of attractive active Brownian particles (ABPs). Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that these particles undergo liquid-gas phase separation, and spatially varying activity fields induce striking emergent dynamics. Droplets migrate up activity gradients, and above a critical activity, they fragment into a gas phase. The gas then migrates down the gradient, and droplets reassemble, yielding robust positioning cycles. This emergent condensate cycle arises without biochemical feedback loops and relies only on the interplay of attractions, motility, and gradients. In binary mixtures of active-passive particles, differential cohesion leads to self-sorting of particles, where strongly-cohesive ABPs compact into dense cores surrounded by peripheries enriched with weakly-cohesive passive particles. The passive particles stabilize the dynamic clusters of ABPs, and they migrate toward high-activity regions. Our findings suggest a generic mechanism for spatial control and turnover of condensates in biology."

      "summary": "Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a >10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials."

      "summary": "Large-scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic antenna complexes of the Chlorobium Tepidum green sulfur bacteria (GSB) containing more than one hundred thousand chlorophyll molecules, comparable with natural size, have been performed. Here we have modeled the entire process of the exciton energy transfer, from sunlight absorption to exciton trapping in the reaction centers (RCs) in presence of a thermal bath. The energy transfer has been analyzed using the radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and solving the rate equations for the populations. Sunlight pumping has been modeled as black-body radiation with an attenuation factor that takes the Sun-Earth distance into account. Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes, and the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our analysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB the number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure rate and the internal efficiency shows values close to 80%. We also considered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not reflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the transition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case where all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the important case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the light-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the high sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole moments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could drive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices."

However, how the two parameters correlate with one another is not fully clear and sometimes can be controversial. Here I propose using the energy balance relation derived from fracture mechanics to understand the correlation between $\\Delta\\tau$ and $V_r$. The central idea is to explore the balance between fracture energy $G_c$ and dynamic energy release rate $G_d$ (which itself is a function of $\\Delta\\tau$ and $V_r$) under various conditions of $G_c$. Using averaged values of $\\Delta\\tau$ and $V_r$ for comparison, it is shown that near constant $G_c$ can yield a positive correlation between $\\Delta\\tau$ and $V_r$, whereas variable $G_c$ dependent on space, time or other factors may cause a negative correlation between $\\Delta\\tau$ and $V_r$. These results suggest a need to examine the condition of other factors (such as $G_c$) when evaluating the correlation between $\\Delta\\tau$ and $V_r$. Extra issues can complicate the evaluation of the correlation between $\\Delta\\tau$ and $V_r$ when rupture process is inferred from far-field observations, accompanied by strong spatiotemporal variation, or followed by additional phases, which should be investigated by future studies."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of \"time estimation.\" Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times. Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity."

Using numerical simulations and developing a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; for this they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches."

The inputs encode key material features, such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, and other structural and electronic properties. Unlike shallow machine learning models, which require extensive feature engineering, or Graph Neural Networks, which rely on graph representations derived from atomic coordinates, pretrained language models can process textual inputs directly, eliminating the need for manual feature preprocessing or structure-based encoding. Material descriptions were constructed in two formats: structured strings with a consistent template and natural language narratives generated via the ChatGPT API. Each model was augmented with a custom regression head and finetuned for band gap prediction task. Language models of different architectures and parameter sizes were all able to predict band gaps from human-readable text with strong accuracy, achieving MAEs in the range of 0.25-0.33 eV, highlighting the success of this approach for scientific regression tasks. Finetuned Llama-3, with 1.2 billion parameters, achieved the highest accuracy (MAE 0.248 eV, R2 0.891). MatSciBERT, pretrained on materials science literature, reached comparable performance (MAE 0.288 eV, R2 0.871) with significantly fewer parameters (110 million), emphasizing the importance of domain-specific pretraining. Attention analysis shows that both models selectively focus on compositional and spin-related features while de-emphasizing geometric features, reflecting the difficulty of capturing spatial information from text. These results establish that pretrained language models can effectively extract complex feature-property relationships from textual material descriptions."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Deep generative models have become ubiquitous due to their ability to learn and sample from complex distributions. Despite the proliferation of various frameworks, the relationships among these models remain largely unexplored, a gap that hinders the development of a unified theory of AI learning. We address two central challenges: clarifying the connections between different deep generative models and deepening our understanding of their learning mechanisms. We focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), known for their universal approximation capabilities for discrete distributions. By introducing a reciprocal space formulation, we reveal a connection between RBMs, diffusion processes, and coupled Bosons. We show that at initialization, the RBM operates at a saddle point, where the local curvature is determined by the singular values, whose distribution follows the Marcenko-Pastur law and exhibits rotational symmetry. During training, this rotational symmetry is broken due to hierarchical learning, where different degrees of freedom progressively capture features at multiple levels of abstraction. This leads to a symmetry breaking in the energy landscape, reminiscent of Landau theory. This symmetry breaking in the energy landscape is characterized by the singular values and the weight matrix eigenvector matrix. We derive the corresponding free energy in a mean-field approximation. We show that in the limit of infinite size RBM, the reciprocal variables are Gaussian distributed. Our findings indicate that in this regime, there will be some modes for which the diffusion process will not converge to the Boltzmann distribution. To illustrate our results, we trained replicas of RBMs with different hidden layer sizes using the MNIST dataset. Our findings bridge the gap between disparate generative frameworks and also shed light on the processes underpinning learning in generative models."

We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole."

We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the radiative corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the theory is unitary at the tree level."

Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al."

We present a stochastic scaling model (SSM) for particle charging that unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single theoretical framework. The model grounds in a physics-based stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge measured in a highly-controlled reference experiment. To test the SSM, we implemented it in an open-source Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver. When simulating 300 000 insulating particles transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows, the SSM takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SSM offers a physically grounded route to large-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows."

Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Salt precipitation during CO2 injection into saline aquifers obstructs flow-controlling pore throats and reduces permeability, yet reactive transport models assume salt forms dispersed, non-porous crystals with minimal flow impact. We demonstrate that halite instead creates three-dimensional porous networks with 40% internal porosity through self-enhancing growth mechanisms absent from current models. Time-lapse X-ray micro-computed tomography and spectral imaging reveal preferential nucleation at gas-liquid interfaces, where porous hydrophilic aggregates generate capillary suction that draws brine films toward precipitation sites, accelerating growth and expanding reactive surface area in a positive feedback loop. Spectral tomography shows systematic density gradients reflecting two-stage precipitation: dense macrocrystalline cores formed under moderate supersaturation and evaporation, surrounded by microcrystalline overgrowths from rapid late-stage dynamics. These overgrowths create umbrella-like crusts that encapsulate residual brine beneath surface layers. This porous architecture explains why modest porosity reduction causes severe permeability decline, as aggregates preferentially obstruct flow percolation pathways rather than uniformly cementing grains or filling pore space. Five interconnected mechanisms drive self-enhancing growth across nano- to centimeter scales: interface nucleation, secondary porous structure formation, steep concentration gradients, hydrophilic substrate film maintenance, and capillary-driven solute delivery. Our quantitative characterization of internal salt architecture, reactive surface areas, and pore connectivity provides essential parameters for improving predictive models of evaporation-precipitation dynamics in carbon storage, soil salinization, and cultural heritage preservation."

In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems."

We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a meso- scopic feedback mechanism.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: How the detailed structure of quantum complexity emerges from quantum dynamics remains a fundamental challenge highlighted by advances in quantum simulators and information processing. The celebrated Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem provides a universal constraint on the rate of entanglement generation, yet it leaves open the problem of fully characterizing fine entanglement structures. Here we introduce the concept of Spectral-Entangling strength, which captures the structural entangling power of an operator, and establish a spectral SIE theorem: a universal speed limit for R'enyi entanglement growth at $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ decay threshold in the entanglement spectrum. Remarkably, our bound at $\\alpha=1/2$ is both qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, defining the universal threshold beyond which entanglement growth becomes unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients and enables rigorous truncation-based error control, linking entanglement structure to computational complexity. Building on this, we derive a generalized entanglement area law under an adiabatic-path condition, extending a central principle of quantum many-body physics to general interactions. As a concrete application, we show that one-dimensional long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states, thereby closing the long-standing quasi-polynomial gap and demonstrating that such systems can be simulated efficiently with tensor-network methods. By explicitly controlling R'enyi entanglement, we obtain a rigorous, a priori error guarantee for the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend the SIE theorem to the spectral domain and establish a unified framework that unveils the detailed and universal structure underlying quantum complexity."

Building on the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, we introduce the probability-phase mutual information $I(P;\\Phi)$. We show that it characterizes quantum coherence at the ensemble level and that ensemble coherence systematically exceeds density-matrix coherence, thus quantifying the structure lost when averaging over pure states. Eventually, its relevance for quantum thermodynamics and deep thermalization in condensed matter physics is highlighted by explicit examples: canonical ensembles reveal temperature-dependent probability-phase correlations absent from thermal density matrices, while a non-vanishing $I(P;\\Phi)$ signals the breakdown of deep thermalization."

An emerging paradigm in this direction is critical quantum metrology -- which harnesses the enhanced susceptibility and nonclassical correlations naturally occurring near quantum phase transitions as resources for quantum-enhanced precision. This tutorial provides a pedagogical introduction to key concepts and a detailed overview of prominent quantum sensing strategies that exploit critical phenomena in metrology. Through examples of increasing complexity, the reader is guided through various critical quantum sensing protocols applied to different critical systems. Special emphasis is placed on the optimal scaling of estimation precision with respect to fundamental resources. Finally, we discuss how critical quantum metrology extends from idealized models to realistic open-system, dissipative regimes, and strongly correlated fermionic systems, outlining both the challenges and opportunities for future quantum technologies."

Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty, particularly an agent's tolerance for risk, determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for nonequilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modeled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we consider a Szilard-type engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi divergences in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a Renyi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change, increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals."

However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control these materials' electronic properties."
