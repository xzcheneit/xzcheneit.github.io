Here, the authors uncover a thermally induced magnetoelastic switching mechanism that occurs within the duration of current pulses previously employed in the field and can closely mimic spin-orbit torque effects—yet operates on a fundamentally slower timescale. By employing a tailored sample geometry, they disentangle these competing effects and conclusively demonstrate ultrafast Néel spin-orbit torque switching in Mn 2 Au. [Phys. Rev.

This includes the nearest star, our Sun. A precise understanding of hydrogen burning is crucial to predicting its luminosity, neutrino production, and helioseismology. This review describes the theoretical and experimental work of the last decade that has advanced our understanding of the nuclear physics of hydrogen burning. It describes the plasma and atomic physics that influences the solar environment in which the nuclear reactions take place, as well as the diagnostics probes—including solar neutrinos and helioseismology—that allow us to test our resulting model of the solar interior.

One of the ordered phases can in principle be used to build a heat engine that is less dissipative, shows reduced fluctuations, and can operate near maximum power and maximum efficiency over a wide parameter range.
