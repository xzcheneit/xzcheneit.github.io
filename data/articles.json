This configuration enables deeply distributed magnon modes and enhances magnetoelastic interactions with microwave phonons. As a result, the team observes clear formation of magnon polarons, manifested as pronounced avoided crossings in the spectra. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 064053] Published Fri Dec 19, 2025"

The applied electric field is shown to play dual roles in generating the nonlinear Hall effect by first generating a nonequilibrium orbital magnetization and then perturbing the associated edge states, and a unique nonlinear Hall effect is predicted in isotropic chiral metals driven by a noncollinear bichromatic electric field.

      "summary": "Optical coherence tomography is widely used in biomedical imaging and materials science, but dispersion in the sample can strongly reduce both resolution and penetration depth. Quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT) can cancel this dispersion and double the axial resolution, yet existing implementations rely on dim sources and interference signals that are difficult to filter and stabilize. This work demonstrates a robust cross-correlation QOCT scheme based on a Michelson interferometer fed by a bright collinear entangled-photon source, which suppresses parasitic terms, improves the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of four over standard QOCT, and preserves dispersion cancellation.

This work offers a simpler route: monolithic beams of undulating profile forming a phononic crystal that is tuned to couple longitudinal and flexural behavior. Mode locking with inverted group velocities converts incident longitudinal waves into flexural waves via reflection. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 064050] Published Thu Dec 18, 2025"
