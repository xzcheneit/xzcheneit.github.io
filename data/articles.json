By harnessing nonlinearity, the authors demonstrate a powerful balancing mechanism that stabilizes such waves into robust solitons that propagate undistorted through nonreciprocal lattices. This finding opens the door to tunable, one-way transmission of energy and signals in active non-Hermitian media. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, L041005] Published Fri Oct 31, 2025"
