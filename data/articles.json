      "summary": "Nature Communications, Published online: 14 November 2025; doi:10.1038/s41467-025-66183-z Carbapenems are last-resort antibiotics, but resistance is rising due to hydrolyzing enzymes called carbapenemases. The authors present a machine learning algorithm and web-app to rapidly predict carbapenemase-production in Enterobacterales."
