      "summary": "The realization of quantum transport effects at elevated temperatures has long intrigued researchers due to the implications for unveiling novel physics and developing quantum devices. In this work, we report remarkable quantum linear magnetoresistance (LMR) in the Weyl semiconductor tellurium at high temperatures of 40-300 K under strong magnetic fields up to 60 T. At high fields, the Weyl band features a large energy gap between the lowest and first Landau levels, which suppresses thermal excitation and preserves Landau quantization at high temperatures. The LMR is observed as long as majority carriers remain in the lowest Landau level without requiring monochromaticity, allowing it to persist up to room temperature. The inverse relationship between the LMR slope and temperature provides clear evidence that quantum LMR originates from high-temperature phonon scattering in the quantum limit, firstly demonstrating a theoretical prediction made nearly fifty years ago. This study highlights the key role of electron-phonon interaction and reveals an innovative quantum mechanism for achieving high-temperature LMR, fundamentally distinct from previous findings. Our results bridge a gap in the understanding of phonon-mediated quantum-limit physics and establish strong magnetic fields at high temperatures as a promising platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena."

      "summary": "We obtain moire quasicrystal patterns via Floquet-engineering intralayer-atomic interactions in twisted bilayer hexagonal optical lattices of ultracold atoms. By tracking the density wave amplitude, we partition the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes of each stage in both real and momentum space. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is intimately tied to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude will facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Most notably, at specific parameters, a twelve-fold (D12) moire quasicrystal pattern emerges which closely resembles that observed in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space patterns likewise exhibit pronounced rotational symmetry, with those in real space showing good agreement at specific instants. The patterns obtained exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting that this frequency-dependent pattern formation could be exploited for quantum precision measurement. Our findings introduce a new paradigm for investigating the quasicrystals and their associated symmetries in ultracold atomic system."

      "summary": "Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems."

Our Ginzburg-Landau theory predicts a CDW instability that generically opens a gap at the Fermi energy while preserving the nodal line crossing. However, as the Fermi level approaches the nodal line, the density of states at the nodal line decreases, eventually disappearing as the CDW vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ goes to zero. Exactly at $\\mathbf{Q} = 0$, the order parameter explicitly breaks the glide symmetry protecting the nodal line, which allows a gap to open. Yet, for small but finite $\\mathbf{Q}$, the nodal line may vanish within experimental resolution even when the glide symmetry is preserved. Our results provide a consistent explanation for recent experimental observations."

      "summary": "Recent experiments have observed transitions between superconductivity and correlated magnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ near van-Hove fillings, driven by the displacement field $D$. Motivated by the experiment, we theoretically propose a general mechanism for a $D$-controlled transition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit-coupled hexagonal systems, where van Hove singularities (VHS) lie on the Fermi level. We show that such a transition can be naturally captured by a simple VHS-only model without Fermi surface details, where the inter-VHS interactions that govern the Fermi surface instabilities is controlled by $D$ through the band projection of screened Coulomb interaction. By treating this simple model with renormalization group technique beyond mean-field level, we find that a chiral $d/p$-wave superconductivity naturally dominates under a weak displacement field $DD_c$, a \\textit{valley ferromagnetic phase} (vFM) takes over, which is spatially non-uniform due to valley-modulated magnetization. Finally, we discuss generic conditions for the predicted superconductivity-to-ferromagnetism transition to take place in the rich family of few-layer hexagonal van der Waals material systems. Taking twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a case study, we discuss experimental detections that can falsify our prediction."

      "summary": "Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled."

Remarkably, when the anti-ferromagnetic Kitaev model is perturbed by an ferromagnetic $\\Gamma$ interaction, we find that the single-vison and fermion gaps remain open while the gap of a magnon-like local boson vanishes, implying that the resulting state has coexistence of a spontaneous broken symmetry and the fractionalization pattern of the Kitaev spin liquid. The magnetic long-range order could be either a stripy antiferromagnet or an incommensurate spiral, depending on the sign of $\\Gamma'$."

      "summary": "In ordered quantum magnets where interactions between elementary excitations dominate over their kinetic energy, perturbative approaches often fail, making non-perturbative methods essential to capture spectral features such as bound states and the redistribution of weight within excitation continua. Although an increasing number of experiments report anomalous spin excitation continua in such systems, their microscopic interpretation remains an open challenge. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in its 1/3-plateau phase using two complementary non-perturbative approaches: exact diagonalization in a truncated Hilbert space for a gas of elementary excitations (THED) and matrix product state (MPS) simulations. Alongside cross-validation between these methods, we benchmark our results against inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. The THED analysis confirms the presence of two-magnon bound states and identifies the anomalous scattering continuum observed in both MPS and INS as a two-magnon resonance, arising from hybridization between the bound state and the two-magnon continuum. Furthermore, THED reveals bound states overlapping with the continuum, enriching the interpretation of continuum anomalies. More broadly, THED provides a robust framework for investigating anomalous spin excitation continua and bound-state effects in other materials with gapped spectra. Its combination of accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a powerful tool for extracting reliable microscopic models in semiclassical regimes."

      "summary": "Solid state nanopores have emerged as powerful tools for single-molecule sensing, yet the rapid uncontrolled translocation of the molecule through the pore remains a key limitation. We have previously demonstrated that an active dual-nanopore system, consisting of two closely spaced pores operated via feedback controlled biasing, shows promise in achieving controlled, slowed-down translocation. Translocation control is achieved via capturing the DNA in a special tug-of-war configuration, whereby opposing electrophoretic forces at each pore are applied to a DNA molecule co-captured at the two pores. Here, we systematically explore translocation physics during DNA tug-of-war focusing on genomically relevant longer dsDNA using a T$_4$-DNA model (166\\,kbp). We find that longer molecules can be trapped in tug-of-war states with an asymmetric partitioning of contour between the pores. Secondly, we explore the physics of DNA disengagement from a tug-of-war configuration, focusing on the dynamics of DNA free-end escape, in particular how the free-end velocity depends on pore voltage, DNA size and the presence of additional DNA strands between the pores (i.e. arising in the presence of folded translocation). These findings validate theoretical predictions derived from a first passage model and provide new insight into the physical mechanisms governing molecule disengagement in tug-of-war."

      "summary": "The stability of high-speed liquid jets is crucial for applications ranging from precision printing to needle-free drug delivery, yet it is fundamentally limited by capillary-driven breakup. A common strategy to stabilize jets is to use surfactants to lower surface tension. However, in nozzle-free jetting driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs), extreme deformation rates cause conventional surfactants to desorb, calling for alternative strategies to stabilize jets. In particular, we find that tuning the nanoscale softness of PNIPAM microgels provides a robust, biocompatible strategy to overcome this limitation. Soft, low-cross-linker-density microgels form elastic interfacial networks at the air-water interface that suppress surface tension recovery, delay Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities, and extend SAW-driven jet lengths by up to 44%. In contrast, stiffer microgels lose network cohesion under strain, leading to rapid jet breakup. To gain molecular-level insights, we perform dissipative particle dynamics simulations, which reveal that polymer bridges in soft microgels remain entangled during elongation, maintaining a reduced effective surface tension. Finally, a simple scaling analysis, balancing the SAW-driven kinetic energy imparted to the droplet against the surface energy required to form a jet, quantitatively predicts the observed length enhancement. This surfactant-free, biocompatible approach lays the foundation for long-lived jets, enabling precision needle-free drug delivery, high-speed printing, and other high-strain interfacial flow applications."

      "summary": "Silica-carbonate biomorphs are a class of emergent materials, i.e. composite microstructures made of nanometric carbonate crystallites surrounded by amorphous silica. They form via a co-precipitation process in an interplay between alkaline earth metal carbonate and siliceous species, and self-organize into a multitude of shapes with a distinct long-range order of the carbonate nanocrystals. Biomorphs are frequently studied to understand the formation of life-like structures emerging from geochemical processes at extreme conditions. Further, due to their optical properties they lend themselves as a platform for optical, electronic or magnetic functionalization. A big hurdle in this task is our incomplete understanding of the underlying formation process and how the interplay between synthesis parameters affects important nanoscale properties such as crystalline structure and texture, as well as the shape on the microscale. Here, we use X-ray texture and diffraction tomography to unveil the local crystalline texture in 3D of silica-witherite biomorphs. We find surprisingly different growth motifs across different morphologies, but also that the crystalline properties vary significantly within a single structure. We distinguish different growth regimes and from that, infer how the co-precipitating silica shapes the crystalline particles. Thereby, we gain deeper insight into how biomorphs form these distinct complex morphologies."

This is particularly invaluable in complex systems or for materials subject to certain environmental conditions, such as those exposed to X-ray radiation during routine characterisation. Despite the clear benefit in this use case to shed further light on intermolecular damage processes, the use of theory to study radiation damage of samples is still not commonplace, with very few studies in existing literature. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of density functional theory for modelling the electronic structure of two industrially important organometallic systems of the formula [M(COD)Cl]$_2$ where M=Ir/Rh and COD=1,5-cyclooctadiene, which are subject to X-ray irradiation via X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Our approach allows calculated spectra to be compared directly to experimental data, in this case, the X-ray photoelectron valence band spectra, enabling the valuable correlation of individual atomic states to the electronic structure."

      "summary": "Dynamically compressed materials in longitudinal waves are described by two physical models: hydrostatic pressure, with equal, normal, principal stresses or material uniaxially strained in the wave propagation direction. These models are disparate, so experimental comparisons and evaluations are important. Polycrystalline material in a state of hydrostatic pressure, will have no eccentricity of X-ray diffracted Debye-Scherrer rings. A general three-dimensional solution of Bragg diffracted X-rays based on principal crystallographic strains in the compression wave was found. The distortion of X-ray diffraction beams has been used for strain measurements; the analysis developed incorporates a strained reciprocal lattice and the incident X-ray beam. Strain distorted Polanyi surfaces form an annulus of compression with an ellipsoid of revolution in reciprocal space which is intersected by Ewald sphere for Bragg diffraction. The in-situ measurements for strain describe nanosecond diffraction evaluated using two planes, and both in the same crystallographic phase. Diffraction from Al, Ni, Na, and Invar quantify the compression axial strains in these materials: the compression axial ratios are 0.65, 1.05, 0.88 and 1.58 at pressures of 291, 402, 409, and 367 GPa for the respective materials. Crystal structure transformations with homogeneous pressurized stresses, mandating equal normal strains, should not be anticipated to agree with heterogeneous, uniaxially strained and sheared crystalline phases. Measurements support in-plane strains increasing with pressure, p, in fcc and hcp aluminum as with p in GPa."

Stochastic failure properties of the base material and disordered microstructural geometries can contribute to variations in the global failure mechanics that are not captured in traditional analyses of ordered, deterministic architected materials. We present a probabilistic framework that couples stochastic material failure and geometric disorder to predict failure in lattice mechanical metamaterials. These predictions are verified through finite element analysis, which confirm that disorder and stochasticity affect both the mean and variance of the damage initiation load in a lattice, with average failure loads being generally reduced and variance increasing with higher levels of disorder and stochasticity. The fracto-cohesive length and representative volume element size are also predicted and constrain the minimum defect and lattice sizes, respectively, for failure to be considered a fracture process. The framework is extended to consider the fracture behavior of the lattice, the development of damage zones, and their impact on the steady-state fracture toughness."

      "summary": "Spin waves are the fundamental excitations in magnetically ordered spin systems and are ubiquitously observed in magnetic materials. However, the standard understanding of spin waves as collective spin oscillations in an effective harmonic potential does not consider the possibility of soft modes, such as those due to an effective quartic potential. In this work, we show that such quartic potentials arise under very general conditions in a broad class of isotropic spin systems without a fine-tuning of the interaction parameters. Considering models with spin spiral ground states in two and three spatial dimensions, we numerically demonstrate that quartic amplitude spin oscillations produce a fluctuation-induced spin-wave gap which grows with temperature according to a characteristic power-law. In conjunction with a phenomenological theory, the present work provides a general theoretical framework for describing soft spin modes, extending the previously discussed spin dynamics in the presence of order-by-disorder, and highlighting the important role of finite-size effects. Our predictions of a temperature-dependent gap in spiral spin systems could be tested in inelastic neutron scattering experiments, providing direct spectroscopic evidence for thermal effects arising from soft spin modes in magnetic materials."

      "summary": "We investigate the magnetization reversal process induced by a single femtosecond laser pulse in ferromagnetic spin valves by systematically comparing reference layers composed of pure Co, Ni, and Fe. To circumvent the loss of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy associated with changes in reference layer material and thickness, we design spin valves with in plane magnetizations. While antiparallel to parallel switching is observed for all three elements, parallel to antiparallel switching occurs only with a Co reference layer and is absent with Ni and Fe. This difference is attributed to the distinct ultrafast magnetization dynamics of the reference materials. Our results support the hypothesis that parallel to antiparallel switching requires a rapid remagnetization of the reference layer, which generates a substantial negative spin current polarized opposite to the free layer magnetization an essential condition for triggering its reversal."

This approach enables the evaluation of angular-momentum-resolved electron-phonon matrix elements and McMillan-Hopfield parameters of not only elemental transition metals but also their compounds. The results are benchmarked against full-potential linearized augmented plane wave calculations, showing excellent agreement. We further outline a practical route to extract atom- and symmetry-type-resolved electron-phonon coupling constants.

      "summary": "Electrons on Fermi arcs (FAs), a hallmark of Weyl semimetals, exhibit chiral transport harboring chiral anomaly, negative magnetoresistance, and Majorana zero modes. While FAs were observed in exemplary Weyl semimetal TaAs and Co3Sn2S2, the manipulation of FAs has been rarely explored. Here we take Co3Sn2S2 as an example and demonstrate that tuning the electronic correlation strength is an effective way to control the topology and connectivity of FAs. After achieving a good agreement with experimentally measured band structure by employing combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we show that the experimental charge dynamics are well reproduced by DFT+DMFT calculations but not DFT calculations. Electronic correlation renormalizes the bands around the Fermi level and modifies the energy and location of Weyl points, and the resulting FAs. In particular, on the Co-terminated surface, the FAs are formed by connecting Weyl points located in adjacent Brillouin zones in DFT+DMFT calculations and experiments, in strong contrast to the FAs connecting Weyl points within the same Brillouin zone in DFT calculations. We further show the evolution of FAs with correlation and reveal a topological change of the FAs on the Sn-terminated surface at stronger correlation strength. Our study sheds new light on experimental manipulation of FAs to improve the electronic properties of correlated Weyl semimetals."

      "summary": "Flat electronic bands, where interactions among electrons overwhelm their kinetic energies, hold the promise for exotic correlation physics. The dice lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at $E_F$ in the van der Waals (vdW) electride [YCl]$^{2+}$: 2e-. In this system, excess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an interstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our ARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in YCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The flat bands and other dispersive bands observed in ARPES find excellent agreement with first-principles calculations, and theoretical analysis reveals that the near-$E_F$ electronic structure is well captured by a simple dice-lattice model. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material and establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals. Our results further demonstrate the anionic electron lattice as a novel scheme for realizing lattice geometries and electronic structures rare to find in conventional crystalline systems."

      "summary": "According to classical Miedema theory, reducing crystals to the order of nanometer sizes might greatly modulate the mixing enthalpy of elements, thus enabling the invention of a lot of new bulk-immiscible alloys. Although numerous alloys with higher mixing enthalpies remain unexplored, this strategy is approaching its limit, as reflected by the critical diameter of recent alloys of 1.8 nm, which corresponds to ~150 atoms and hardly provides a crystalline order. Future development requires not only even smaller atomic-scale control but also a new surface energy-saving mechanism. Here, we report the formation of W-Cu nanoalloys with a very large miscibility gap in the bulk via the use of an atomically size-selected cluster beam source as an example. The face-centered cubic (FCC) structure was demonstrated through electron diffraction, which indicated a lattice constant of 3.88{\\AA} for W0.85Cu0.15 nanoalloys (~2280 atoms). In this comprehensive study that covers a large parameter space of W/Cu compositions and numbers of atoms, an asymmetric miscibility nanophase diagram in which W-rich compositions favor mixing and the critical size is approximately 6000 atoms, which far exceeds the approximately tens of atoms predicted via classical theory, was obtained for the first time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a mutual strain-induced mechanism that simultaneously lowers the surface energies while reducing the size to the atomic scale. This approach paves the way for the development of new high-performance nonequilibrium phase alloys."

We consider a partially mixed helical (superhelical) regime, where the magnetic field (superconductivity) has a dominant contribution. Using bosonization and renormalization group techniques, it is shown how the interactions affect the correlation functions in the system. In the partially mixed helical regime, we find that superconducting pairing promotes spin-density-wave correlations, while singlet and triplet pairing correlations suppress, especially under attractive interactions. In contrast, in the superhelical regime, a perturbative Zeeman field enhances both spin singlet and spin triplet-x pairings under repulsive interactions. We calculate both logarithmic and residual corrections to charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and pairing correlations, revealing short- and long-range behaviors. We further investigate spin transport properties supplemented by a renormalization group analysis of the temperature and frequency dependence of spin conductivity. We also analyze the transport of momentum-spin-locked carriers in the presence of Zeeman-induced and pairing-induced gaps, uncovering the effect of interactions and the interplay between the two gaps in helical systems."

We assume that the initial temperature $T_i$ of the finite-sized cold heat bath satisfies $T_i\\leq T_h$, where $T_h$ is the temperature of the hot heat bath. By consuming the input power, the refrigerator transfers the heat from a finite-sized cold heat bath to the hot heat bath. Hence, the temperature of the finite-sized cold heat bath decreases until it reaches the desired low-temperature $T_f$. By minimizing the input work for the heat transport process, we derive the optimal path for temperature change. We calculate the coefficient of performance as a function of average input power. We also obtain the bounds for the coefficient of performance by applying the asymmetric dissipation limits."

This study benchmarks the performance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations against diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for adsorption properties of small gas molecules relevant to CO oxidation -- namely O$_2$, CO, CO$_2$, and atomic oxygen -- on a single Pt atom supported by pristine graphene. Our findings reveal that DMC calculations provide a significantly different landscape of adsorption energetics compared to DFT results. Notably, DFT predicts different lowest-energy configurations and spin states, particularly for O$_2$, which suggests potential discrepancies in predicting the catalytic behavior. Furthermore, this study identifies the critical issue of CO poisoning, highlighted by the large disparity between the DMC adsorption energies of O$_2$ ($-1.23(2)$ eV) and CO ($-3.37(1)$ eV), which can inhibit the catalytic process. These results emphasize the necessity for more sophisticated computational approaches in catalysis research, aiming to refine the prediction accuracy of reaction mechanisms and to enhance the design of more effective catalysts."

Here, we theoretically investigate the JDE in a junction based on monolayer 1T'-WTe$_2$. We first establish that different edge terminations of a WTe$_2$ nanoribbon lead to diverse electronic band structures, some of which host asymmetric edge states even with crystallographically equivalent terminations. This intrinsic asymmetry provides a natural platform for realizing the JDE. With a WTe$_2$-based Josephson junction, we demonstrate a significant JDE arising purely from these asymmetric edges when time-reversal symmetry is broken by a magnetic flux. While the efficiency of this edge-state-driven JDE is inherently limited, we discover a crucial mechanism for its enhancement: by tuning the chemical potential into the bulk bands, the interplay between edge and bulk transport channels boosts the maximum diode efficiency more than $50\\%$. Furthermore, we show that this enhanced JDE is robust against moderate edge disorder. Our findings not only propose a novel route to achieve a highly efficient JDE using intrinsic material properties but also highlight the potential of engineered WTe$_2$ systems for developing advanced superconducting quantum devices."

We explored the structural characteristics and evaluated the coefficient of friction (CoF) as a function of crosslinked monomer fraction (cross-linking bond density) in four-fold cross-linked polymer networks. To estimate CoF, a rigid indenter was inserted to different depths of indentation. Subsequently a constant sliding speed was applied while keeping the depths of indentation fixed. Normal and friction forces were calculated at each depth to estimate CoF through a linear curve-fitting. For adhesion studies, using the force vs. displacement curve we quantified adhesion through the forces during the separation of rigid indenter from surface of crosslinked polymeric materials while unloading after indentation into the sample. The results indicate that as the fraction of crosslinked monomers increases, the stiffness of the crosslinked network increases, while the force of adhesion and CoF decrease. Additionally, increasing the depth of indentation during friction leads to higher frictional forces."

To explore the role of the substrate on the morphology of deposited metals, we present extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on six fcc metals growing in the (111) direction: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt. Our simulation framework enables screening and evaluation of their growth mode under homoepitaxial growth scenarios and proposes morphology control strategies by variation of substrate-metal interaction strengths, modeled by modifying the activation energies for upward and downward migration, combined with thermal vacuum annealing within typical back end of line (BEOL) integration thermal budget. Our simulation results demonstrate that modulation of the substrate interaction strength can be effectively employed to promote island formation or layer-by-layer growth modes overcoming limitations in achieving large flat surface areas. Au, Pd and Pt exhibit the highest sensitivity to substrate interaction strength variations, followed by Ag, showing that strongly interacting substrates decrease the root mean square (RMS) roughness, (uncovered) substrate exposure, island number and island aspect ratios, with moderate increases in flat surface areas and atomic coordination numbers. Additionally, interconnect relevant metrics are improved through thermal vacuum annealing particularly when sufficiently strong metal-substrate interactions are employed, reducing surface roughness, achieving larger flat surface areas, merging and smoothing islands, and decreasing defect density..."

We observe significantly large anomalous Hall conductivity of 1160 ohm-1cm-1 at 2 K when the magnetic field is applied along the magnetic easy axis, which is dominated by intrinsic effects, at least in the low-temperature FM phase.

      "summary": "This study presents a comprehensive investigation of hybrid interfaces formed by monolayer MoS$_2$ coupled with the organic molecules perylene (P), perylene diimide (PDI), and perylene orange (PO). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate the extent to which the mechanical and electronic properties of a hybrid system can be altered by the chemical modification of a given chromophore. The three systems exhibit distinct differences due to their chemical composition and van der Waals contact enabled by their geometry. All systems are structurally stable. The binding energies follow the order PD$>$P$>$PO due to the large $\\pi$-system (PD) and strong structural distortion (PO). Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio exhibit pronounced anisotropy in all cases. PO exhibits the greatest anisotropy due to steric effects and a permanent dipole, which introduce directionality to the molecule-surface interaction. Physisorption is accompanied by net charge transfer in the same order as the binding energies. The associated interfacial polarization results in a change in the work function compared to pristine MoS$_2$ in the order P$>$PO$>$PD. Finally, the presence of organic molecules introduces states into the MoS$_2$ energy gap, with the band alignment being either type II (P, PO) or type I (PD)."

A high substrate growth temperature of 825$^{\\circ}$C induces best structural properties of the overlayer, as revealed by in-situ electron diffraction (RHEED and LEED). The 2D-overlayer grows unstrained right after deposition of a monolayer. However, evidence of pits at the interface is provided by scanning transmission electron microscopy, most probably due to GaN thermal decomposition at the high growth temperature. In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy shows core level shifts that are consistently related to electron transfer from the n-GaN(0001) to the 2H-TaS$_2$ epitaxial layer as well as the formation of a high concentration of nitrogen vacancies close to the interface. Further, no chemical reaction at the interface between the substrate and the grown TaS$_2$ overlayer is deduced from XPS, which corroborates the possibility of integration of 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with an important 3D semiconducting material like GaN."

      "summary": "The physical origin of mutual friction in quantum fluids is deeply connected to the fundamental nature of superfluidity. It stems from the interaction between the superfluid and normal components, mediated by the dynamics of quantized vortices that induce the exchange of momentum and energy. Despite the complexity of these interactions, their essential features can be effectively described by the dissipative point vortex model, an extension of classical vortex dynamics that incorporates finite-temperature dissipation. Mutual friction is parametrized by the longitudinal (dissipative) coefficient $\\alpha$ and the transverse (reactive) coefficient $\\alpha'$. Accurate measurement of these parameters provides critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms governing vortex motion and dissipation in quantum fluids, serving as a key benchmark for theoretical models. In this work, we employ the dissipative point vortex model to study how fluctuations in the initial conditions influence the inference of $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha'$ from the time evolution of the vortex trajectories. Using experimentally realistic parameters, we show that fluctuations can introduce significant biases in the extracted values of the mutual friction coefficients. We compare our findings with recent experimental measurements in strongly interacting atomic superfluids. Applying this analysis to our recent experimental results allowed us to account for fluctuations in the correct determination of $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha'$."

The critical threshold and exponents associated with the dynamic process are determined using Monte Carlo simulations. Critical behavior observed shows that the model belongs to the directed percolation (DP) universality class. Further, we consider the effect of spontaneous activity generation in the dynamical model. While this destroys the usual critical behaviour, we find that the dynamic susceptibility shows a maximum at a specific value of the control parameter, indicating a quasi-critical behaviour, similar to the findings in the case of DP models and DP-inspired models of neuronal activity with spontaneous activity generation. Interestingly, in the presence of spontaneous activity, we find that spatial and temporal correlations exhibit power-law decays at a value of the control parameter different from the quasi-critical threshold indicating that there are two effective thresholds in such a case, one where the response function is maximum and another where the spatial and temporal correlations show scale free behaviour."

Still, it remains a major challenge to measure non-equilibrium properties such as current and dissipation, and their relation to structure. Scanning nanoprobes utilizing superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are uniquely suited here, due to their unparalleled magnetic and thermal sensitivity. Here, we introduce tapping-mode SQUID-on-tip, which combines atomic force microscopy (AFM) with nanoSQUID sensing. Our probes minimize nanoSQUID-sample distance, provide in-plane magnetic sensitivity, and operate without lasers. Frequency multiplexing enables simultaneous imaging of currents, magnetism, dissipation and topography. The large voltage output of our proximity-junction nanoSQUIDs allows us to resolve nanoscale currents as small as 100 nA using a simple four-probe electronic readout without cryogenic amplification. By capturing local magnetic, thermal, and electronic response without external radiation, our technique offers a powerful non-invasive route to study dynamic phenomena in exotic materials and delicate quantum circuits."

Particular attention is given to the effect of different statistical interpretations of the stochastic differential equation and to the relation between the approximations and the known, exact solutions to the one-dimensional problem. Beginning with a reasonable, but heuristic, simplifying assumption, a one-dimensional solution to the problem is developed. This is then simplified by introducing further approximations resulting in a sequence of increasingly simple expressions culminating in the classic result of Langer(Ann. Phys. 54, 258 (1969)) and others. The various approximations are tested on two dimensional problems by comparison to simulation results and it is found that the one-dimensional approximations capture most of the non-Arrhenius dependence on the energy barrier which is lost in the Langer approximation while still converging to the latter in the large-barrier limit."

The setup leverages photon correlation imaging, a space- and time-resolved dynamic light scattering method, to measure the dynamics along three orthogonal directions and on two distinct length scales, from tens of nanometers to a couple of microns. We show how to avoid artifacts due to scattering from the surface of the polymer films and derive a theoretical expression for the intensity correlation function due to a purely affine deformation, showing that the setup sensitivity may be simply tuned by varying the acceptance angle of the collection optics. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of the setup by investigating the microscopic dynamics of a poly(dimethylsiloxne) polymer network under tensile strain in the linear regime. We find that non-affine dynamics dominate on length scales smaller than a few microns, above which the affine response is recovered. Surprisingly, the cross-over length separating the non-affine and affine regimes \\textit{increases} upon decreasing the applied tensile strain."

Our magneto-optical experiments reveal a similar excitonic response from the mono- and trilayer systems and a completely different signature in the bilayer flake. This shows a different origin of the low-lying excitonic species (A, A', and B) in the band structure. We confirm the robustness of the magneto-excitonic coupling in few-layer CrSBr.

      "summary": "Disorder plays an important role in materials science, influencing material behavior across different length scales. Imperfections like vacancies, atomic substitutions, lattice distortions, and microstructural inhomogeneities, disrupt ideal periodicity thereby altering physical properties. Analogous to spin-glass systems, electrical 'glassiness' arises when charge carriers confront disordered energy landscapes, leading to a broad range of relaxation times, especially in polycrystalline materials where dipoles experience competing exchange interactions. Complex impedance, permittivity, and electric modulus distill out separate resistive and capacitive effects, offering insights into how microstructural inhomogeneities affects conduction mechanism. In polycrystalline double perovskites A2SmTaO6 (A = Ba, Ca), with a power law driven ac conductivity, the hopping and relaxation of carriers is affected by both grains and grain boundaries. Scaling of ac conductivity and impedance response reveals correlation between conduction and relaxation timescales. The inhomogeneities in local energy landscape of 'frustrated' dipoles restrict the 'universality' of conduction mechanism across the bulk length scale."

      "summary": "Second-order phase transitions are characterised by critical scaling and universality. The singular behaviour of thermodynamic quantities at the transition, in particular, is determined by critical exponents of the universality class of the transition. However, critical properties are also characterised by the probability distribution of order parameter across the transition, where non-Gaussian statistics are expected, but remain largely unexplored. Here, making use of single-atom-resolved detection in momentum space, we measure the full probability distribution of the amplitude of the order parameter across a continuous phase transition in an interacting lattice Bose gas. We find that fluctuations are captured by an effective potential -- reconstructed from the measured probability distribution by analogy with Landau theory -- displaying a non-trivial minimum in the superfluid (ordered) phase, which vanishes at the transition point. Additionally, we observe non-Gaussian statistics of the order parameter near the transition, distinguished by non-zero and oscillating high-order cumulants. We provide direct experimental evidence that these oscillations are universal, and show numerically that they exhibit critical scaling. Our experiments are conducted in inhomogeneous systems, challenging the conventional understanding of criticality, which is primarily based on homogeneous models. Our results underscore the crucial role of order parameter statistics in probing critical phenomena and universality."

Our simulations show that confinement markedly amplifies the otherwise elusive splay-bend order, primarily by suppressing the intrinsic three-dimensional heliconical structure characteristic of bulk $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$. Remarkably, when the $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase is confined between parallel walls imposing planar anchoring, and the bulk wave vector is oriented parallel to the walls, a smectic splay-bend ($\\mathrm{S_{SB}}$) phase spontaneously emerges near the confining surfaces. This intermediate structure subsequently transforms into the bulk $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase either directly via a smectic splay-bend-twist ($\\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$) phase or through a sequence involving both the $\\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$ and the nematic splay-bend-twist ($\\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$) phases. Notably, the $\\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$ phase becomes particularly pronounced as the molecular bend angle approaches its maximum attainable value in bulk $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$; this regime occurs in close proximity to the $\\mathrm{N}\\text{--}\\mathrm{S_{A}}\\text{--}\\mathrm{S_{SB}}$ triple point on the bulk phase diagram. Our findings reveal a compelling and intricate interplay among chirality, confinement, and molecular ordering, further evidenced by the calculated elementary director distortions. Crucially, this study opens promising avenues for experimental exploration: confined thin-film geometries serve as powerful model systems for revealing and characterizing novel nematic and smectic liquid-crystal phases that remain elusive in, or currently inaccessible to, bulk experiments."

Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena."

      "summary": "Odd-parity magnetism constitutes an intriguing phase of matter which breaks inversion symmetry while preserving time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that the Fe-based superconductors exhibiting coplanar magnetic order realize an odd-parity magnetic state by combining low-energy modeling with density-functional theory. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the electronic spins are polarized along the $k_z$-direction and the splitting of the up and down states exhibits an $h$-wave form-factor. The magnitude of the splitting depends sensitively on specific parameters of the low-energy model, including specific out-of-plane hopping parameters and the Fermi energies of the hole- and electron-pockets. Interestingly, despite this state breaking inversion symmetry and exhibiting a finite out-of-plane Berry curvature and non-linear anomalous Hall effect, the Edelstein effect vanishes. Incorporating spin-orbit coupling tilts the momentum-space electronic spins into the ($k_x,k_y$)-plane and imparts finite in-plane components to the Edelstein response. Our findings highlight the Fe-based superconductors as platforms for exploring odd-parity magnetism both on its own and coexisting with unconventional superconductivity."

      "summary": "Geometric frustration is recognized to generate complex morphologies in self-assembling particulate and molecular systems. In bulk states, frustrated drives structured arrays of topological defects. In the dilute limit, these systems have been shown to form a novel state of self-limiting assembly, in which the equilibrium size of multi-particle domains are finite and well-defined. In this article, we employ Monte Carlo simulations of a recently developed 2D lattice model of geometrically frustrated assembly~\\cite{HackneyPhysRevX.13.041010} to study the phase transitions between the self-limiting and defect bulk phase driven by two distinct mechanisms: (i) increasing concentration and (ii) decreasing temperature or frustration. The first transition is mediated by a concentration-driven percolation transition of self-limiting, worm-like domains into an intermediate heterogeneous network mesophase, which gradually fills in at high concentration to form a quasi-uniform defect bulk state. We find that the percolation threshold is weakly dependent on frustration and shifts to higher concentration as frustration is increased, but depends strongly on the ratio of cohesion to elastic stiffness in the model. The second transition takes place between self-limiting assembly at high-temperature/frustration and phase separation into a condensed bulk state at low temperature/frustration. We consider the competing influences that translational and conformational entropy have on the critical temperature/frustration and show that the self-limiting phase is stabilized at higher frustrations and temperatures than previously expected. Taken together, this understanding of the transition pathways from self-limiting to bulk defect phases of frustrated assembly allows us to map the phase behavior of this 2D minimal model over the full range of concentration."

      "summary": "Superconducting electronics offer significant advantages in speed and power efficiency for next-generation computing and communication systems. However, their practical deployment is limited by the absence of simple, efficient, and scalable superconducting counterparts to key semiconductor components. In this work, we investigate diodes based on planar Josephson junctions fabricated from a conventional niobium superconductor. The nonreciprocity in these diodes arises from the self-field effect induced by the geometrical asymmetry of the junction. By deliberate tuning of the junction parameters, we achieved effectively infinite nonreciprocity (within experimental resolution), characterized by a complete suppression of the superconducting critical current in one direction while maintaining a significant current in the opposite direction. The key novelty of this work lies in the demonstration of the optical diode effect. We observed threshold-free rectification of 75 GHz microwave radiation, indicating that these diodes exhibit near-ideal optical nonreciprocity. Our results open new avenues for ultrafast superconducting electronics and lay the groundwork for wireless sub-THz signal processing."

Such anisotropic conduction is expected to mitigate resistivity increases in narrow interconnect wires at advanced semiconductor technology process nodes, making CoSn a promising candidate for future interconnect applications. In this study, CoSn thin films were fabricated by magnetron sputtering, and their resistivity anisotropy was investigated with respect to crystallographic orientation. Epitaxial growth of single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) films was achieved on a Ru(10-10) buffer layer at deposition temperatures above 350 {\\deg}C. The CoSn films exhibited relatively low \\r{ho} along [0001], reaching 13 micro{\\Omega} cm, and an approximately tenfold anisotropy of \\r{ho} between [0001] and [2-1-10] (a-axis), consistent with previous reports on bulk CoSn single crystals. However, the CoSn(10-10) surface exhibited pronounced roughness, attributed to three-dimensional crystal growth during sputtering, which hinders accurate evaluation of the thickness dependence of resistivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the growth of a CoSn(10-10) single-crystal with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets, as well as domain boundaries within the films. These results highlight both the potential and challenges of employing CoSn kagome metal in future interconnect technologies."

      "summary": "Fast spin manipulation and long spin coherence time in quantum dots are essential features for high fidelity semiconductor spin qubits. However, generally it has not been well established how to optimize these two properties simultaneously, because these two properties are usually not independent from each other. Therefore, the scheme for high fidelity operation by simultaneous tuning Rabi frequency and coherence time, which does not rely on the material-dependent strong spin-orbit interaction and the local magnetic field gradient limiting their scalability, are strongly demanded. Here, we demonstrate an approach to achieve high-fidelity spin control by tuning inter-dot spin-orbit coupling in a GaAs triple quantum dot (TQD), where the third dot provides precise control over orbital energy levels. In an electrically stable charge state with optimized tunnel coupling, we achieve Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz while maintaining coherence through proper tuning of the inter-dot orbital levels of the TQD. By implementing a machine learning-based feedback control that efficiently estimates qubit frequency using past measurement data, we characterize and mitigate the impact of low frequency noise on qubit coherence with minimal measurement overhead. Finally, we demonstrate a $\\pi$/2 gate fidelity of 99.7\\% with a gate time of 4 ns through randomized benchmarking, even in a GaAs quantum dot device where electron spin coherence is typically limited by strong hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. Our approach provides a scalable strategy for high-fidelity spin control in semiconductor quantum dot arrays by utilizing device-specific parameters rather than relying on material properties or external field gradients."

Strong correlation in chemical systems are prevalent and present a formidable challenge in the simulation of these systems, while predictive phenomena in this domain often also requires a demanding level of accuracy to inform chemical behavior. Efficient representations of the many-electron states of chemical systems are therefore also being inspired by machine learning principles to provide an alternative to established approaches. In this chapter, we review recent progress in this endeavor for quantum chemical problems represented in second quantization, and the particular challenges present in this field. In particular, we focus on the application of Gaussian Process States emerging from efficient representations of the many-body wavefunction with rigorous Bayesian modeling frameworks, allowing for the unification of multiple paradigms under a common umbrella. We show how such models (and other representations derived from machine learning) can be used as novel tools to compute ab initio chemical properties, while in turn also informing the design of machine learning models to extract correlation patterns in classical data."

This study investigates the interactions between ionized glyphosate and single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) using computational simulations through semi-empirical tight-binding methods (GFN2-xTB) implemented in the xTB software. The analysis focused on different glyphosate ionization states corresponding to various pH levels: G1 (pH 10.6). Results revealed that glyphosate in G1, G3, G4, and G5 forms exhibited stronger interactions with CNT, demonstrating higher adsorption energies and greater electronic coupling. The neutral state (G2) showed lower affinity, indicating that molecular protonation significantly influences adsorption. Topological analysis and molecular dynamics confirmed the presence of covalent, non-covalent, and partially covalent interactions, while the CNT+G5 system demonstrated moderate interactions suitable for material recycling. These findings suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their extraordinary properties such as nanocapillarity, porosity, and extensive surface area, show promise for environmental monitoring and remediation of glyphosate contamination."

Inspired by recent experimental demonstrations of topological frequency combs in photonics, we theoretically introduce topological magnon frequency combs (MFCs) in a two-dimensional triangular skyrmion lattice. Computing the Chern numbers of magnon bands reveals robust chiral edge states. Strikingly, these topological MFCs originate from nonlinear four-magnon scattering among the chiral edge modes, activated by dual-frequency driving without an amplitude threshold. Comb spacings are readily tunable through excitation frequency detuning. Micromagnetic simulations validate our predictions with good concordance. This work paves the way for defect-immune magnonic devices exploiting MFCs and sparks investigations into topological-nonlinear phenomena in magnetic systems."

      "summary": "Water exhibits remarkable anomalies when supercooled, attributed to a hypothesized liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) between low-density (LDL) and high-density (HDL) liquid phases. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we explore thermal transport and coupled effects in supercooled NaCl and LiCl solutions (1-4 m, 200-300 K). At 1 m, thermal conductivity exhibits a pronounced minimum near 220 K, coinciding with maxima in isothermal compressibility and minima in the speed of sound, both of which are signatures of critical fluctuations. The anomalies progressively diminish with increasing salt concentration and vanish at 4 m, suggesting suppression of the LLPT. The Soret coefficient exhibits a striking behavior. Initially thermophobic at high temperatures (> 280 K), becoming thermophilic upon cooling, then reverting to thermophobic below 220 K. This behavior correlates with structural changes in the hydrogen-bond network of water. Specifically, we find that electrolyte solutions dominated by HDL structures, which are characterized by lower tetrahedral order, exhibit thermophobic behavior, whereas thermodynamic states dominated by LDL structures, with higher tetrahedral order, display thermophilic behavior. Furthermore, Seebeck coefficients exhibit sign reversals near 220-230 K, highlighting the thermoelectric sensitivity to structural transformations and temperature. These findings establish thermal transport as a sensitive probe of supercooled water, revealing that electrolyte solutions preserve the water's anomalies deep into the supercooled regime."

While both are omnipresent in real materials, their individual impacts on charge transport remain elusive. To disentangle their respective roles, we have independently varied the degree of randomness and the strength of electronic correlations -- by chemical substitution and physical pressure, respectively -- within the metallic phase nearby a Mott-insulating state. We find a distinct correlation dependence of the disorder-dependent residual resistivity $\\rho_0$ in the Fermi-liquid regime $\\rho(T)=\\rho_0 + A T^2$, where $A\\propto (m^{\\star}/m)^2$ quantifies the electronic mass enhancement. Contrary to conventional expectations, we observe that at fixed disorder level $\\rho_0$ grows linearly with $A$. This scaling can be understood in terms of chemical-potential fluctuations with variance $\\sigma_\\mu^2$, yielding $\\rho_0 \\propto A\\,\\sigma_\\mu^2$. By comparing our findings to transport data on other organic Mott systems, oxides, heavy-fermion compounds, and moir\\'e materials, we demonstrate that this new relation between residual resistivity and mass enhancement is a universal feature of correlated metals."

Defining a hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low temperature work, in the absence of any interactions, is maximised in the pseudo fermionic limit, where the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or pseudo-fermionic extremes, but instead peaks at intermediate statistical angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions, in this regime. Furthermore, we also identify different modes of operation of the HAO cycle, one of which emerges as a direct consequence of the finite anyon energy at low temperature."

      "summary": "We study the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting, relativistic gas of charged scalar bosons in a uniform magnetic field, including both statistical and vacuum contributions at arbitrary field strengths. Focusing on the low-temperature regime and separating the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) from excited states provides a clearer view of the magnetic field's impact on thermodynamic quantities. We revisit Bose Einstein condensation (BEC), specific heat, magnetization, and the equation of state (EoS). A central result is the diffuse character of BEC induced by the magnetic field, reflected in the specific heat, which exhibits two plateaus: the first appears when the system becomes effectively one-dimensional through magnetic confinement, while the second-associated with the true one-particle ground state-is suppressed by the field. Consequently, no critical condensation temperature arises. For magnetization, the LLL contribution shifts from diamagnetic to paramagnetic As the field strengthen with the inclusion of the excited states, the statistical magnetization remains negative. In contrast, the vacuum contribution dominates at strong fields, driving paramagnetic. We also show that antiparticles enhance specific heat, magnetization, and total pressure. These effects are illustrated for a pion gas under neutron star conditions and compared with previous results for a neutral vector boson system."

      "summary": "The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010) to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain \"real-world\" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system."

      "summary": "This paper presents a traffic state estimation (TSE) method in congestion for distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS). DFOS detects vehicle driving vibrations along the optical fiber and obtains their trajectories in the spatiotemporal plane. From these trajectories, DFOS provides mean velocities for real-time spatially continuous traffic monitoring without dead zones. However, when vehicle vibration intensities are insufficiently low due to slow speed, trajectories cannot be obtained, leading to missing values in mean velocity data. It restricts DFOS applicability in severe congestion. Therefore, this paper proposes a missing value imputation method based on data assimilation. Our proposed method is validated on two expressways in Japan with the reference data. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the imputed mean velocities to the reference increases only by 1.5 km/h as compared with the MAE of non-missing values. This study enhances the wide-range applicability of DFOS in practical cases."

Although system size grows exponentially with the number of spins, our approach exploits the low-rank structure of the density matrix and the sparsity of Hamiltonians to avoid full matrix computations. By representing density matrices via low-rank factors and applying Krylov subspace methods for partial eigendecompositions, we reduce the per-step complexity of Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth schemes from $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(r^2N)$, where $N = 2^n$ is the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ spins and $r \\ll N$ the effective rank. Similarly, memory costs shrink from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(rN)$, since no full $N\\times N$ matrices are formed. A key advance is handling the invariant subspace of zero eigenvalues. By using Householder reflectors built for the dominant eigenspace, we perform the solution entirely without large matrices. For example, a time step of a twenty-spin system, with density matrix size over one million, now takes only seconds on a standard laptop. Both Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods are reformulated to preserve physical properties of the density matrix throughout evolution. This low-rank algorithm enables simulations of much larger spin systems, which were previously infeasible, providing a powerful tool for comparing q-LL and q-LLG dynamics, testing each model validity, and probing how quantum features such as correlations and entanglement evolve across different regimes of system size and damping."

      "summary": "Understanding the radiative decay of exciton-polaritons is essential for achieving long-lived polaritons - a key prerequisite for enhancing nonlinear and quantum polaritonic effects. However, conventional wisdom - the coupled oscillator model - often oversimplifies polariton radiation as independent emissions from uncoupled excitonic and photonic resonances, overlooking the role of strong exciton-photon coupling in reshaping their radiative behavior. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that goes beyond the conventional coupled oscillator model by fully accounting for the collective and coherent nature of exciton-photon interactions. We demonstrate that these interactions can strongly suppress polariton radiation via destructive interference - both within the excitonic ensemble and between excitonic and photonic radiation channels - giving rise to polaritonic bound states in the continuum with infinitely long radiative lifetimes. Our approach offers a unified description of polariton radiative decay and establishes new design principles for engineering long-lived exciton-polaritons with tailored radiation properties, opening new avenues for nonlinear, topological, and quantum polaritonic applications."

      "summary": "This research explores the use of superconductor electronics (SCE) for accelerating fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), focusing on the Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), a key computational bottleneck in FHE schemes. We present SCE-NTT, a dedicated hardware accelerator based on superconductive single flux quantum (SFQ) logic and memory, targeting high performance and energy efficiency beyond the limits of conventional CMOS. To address SFQ constraints such as limited dense RAM and restricted fanin/fanout, we propose a deeply pipelined NTT-128 architecture using shift register memory (SRM). Designed for N=128 32-bit coefficients, NTT-128 comprises log2(N)=7 processing elements (PEs), each featuring a butterfly unit (BU), dual coefficient memories operating in ping-pong mode via FIFO-based SRM queues, and twiddle factor buffers. The BU integrates a Shoup modular multiplier optimized for a small area, leveraging precomputed twiddle factors. A new RSFQ cell library with over 50 parameterized cells, including compound logic units, was developed for implementation. Functional and timing correctness were validated using JoSIM analog simulations and Verilog models. A multiphase clocking scheme was employed to enhance robustness and reduce path-balancing overhead, improving circuit reliability. Fabricated results show the NTT-128 unit achieves 531 million NTT/sec at 34 GHz, over 100x faster than state-of-the-art CMOS equivalents. We also project that the architecture can scale to larger sizes, such as a 2^14-point NTT in approximately 482 ns. Key-switch throughput is estimated at 1.63 million operations/sec, significantly exceeding existing hardware. These results demonstrate the strong potential of SCE-based accelerators for scalable, energy-efficient secure computation in the post-quantum era, with further gains anticipated through advances in fabrication."

Yet, translating these advancements to nonlinear mechanical systems remains an open challenge. Here, we present a new approach to nonlinear mechanical cloaking that frames cloaking as an optimization problem aimed at replicating a target mechanical response. We solve this problem using a differentiable simulation framework coupled with gradient-based optimization. We implement this approach in a class of mechanical metamaterials constructed from rigid units with elastic couplings that support large deformation and contact interactions. Using both numerical simulations and physical experiments, we design optimal cloak structures that effectively mask internal inhomogeneities and shield against external mechanical disturbances both in static and dynamic regimes. This approach provides a versatile design paradigm for creating mechanical systems with integrated cloaking functionality across a broad range of loading scenarios."

This limits the reusability of these approaches in other applications and risks a lack of mathematical rigor on a per-instance basis. We present an approach for expressing linear algebraic problems, specifically those present in physics and quantum computing, as WMC instances. We do this by introducing a framework that converts Dirac notation to WMC problems. We build up this framework theoretically, using a type system and denotational semantics, and provide an implementation in Python. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in calculating the partition functions of several physical models: The transverse-field Ising model (quantum) and the Potts model (classical). The results suggest that heuristics developed in automated reasoning can be systematically applied to a wide class of problems in quantum physics through our framework."

To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates Multiconfigurational Self Consistent Field (MCSCF) with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our initial benchmarks on water dissociation enabled the systematic optimization of key computational parameters, including ansatz selection, active space construction, and error mitigation. Building on this, we extend our approach to investigate the interactions between graphene analogues and water, demonstrating that our framework produces binding energies consistent with high accuracy quantum methods. Furthermore, we apply this methodology to predict the binding energies of transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) on both pristine and defective graphene analogues, revealing strong charge transfer effects and pronounced multireference character phenomena often misrepresented by standard DFT. In contrast to many existing quantum algorithms that are constrained to small molecular systems, our framework achieves chemically accurate predictions for larger, strongly correlated systems such as metal graphene complexes. This advancement highlights the capacity of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to address complex electronic interactions and demonstrates a practical route toward realizing quantum advantage for real world materials applications in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era."

Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields."

An effective optical switch must operate at high duty cycles with fast recovery times, while maintaining substantial modulation depth and full reversibility. Colloidal nanocrystals, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), offer a scalable platform to meet these requirements. In this work, the transmission of ITO nanocrystals near their epsilon-near-zero wavelength is modulated by two-cycle optical pulses at a repetition rate of one megahertz. The modulator exhibits a broad bandwidth spanning from 2 um to 2.5 um. Sensitive fieldoscopy measurements resolve the transient electric-field response of the ITO for the first time, showing that the modulation remains reversible for excitation fluences up to 1.2 mJ/cm2 with a modulation depth of 10%, and becomes fully irreversible beyond 3.3 mJ/cm2, while reaching modulation depth of up to 20%. Field sampling further indicates that at higher excitation fluences, the relative contribution from the first cycle of the optical pulses is reduced. These findings are crucial for the development of all-optical switching, telecommunications, and sensing technologies capable of operating at terahertz switching frequencies."

In this work, we train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network."

While such trade-offs have been extensively studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems coupled to environments of arbitrary strength and subjected to two-point measurements. By introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any time-antisymmetric current is constrained by both entropy production and this forward-backward asymmetry. For general observables, we prove that their relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity term. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding precision limits in broad classes of general open quantum systems."

The model comprises the standard Maxwell field coupled to a Chern-Simons field confined to a planar layer. The electromagnetic behavior of the boundary is emulated through the interaction between the Chern-Simons and Maxwell fields, governed by two parameters: the Chern-Simons mass and the coupling constant between the fields. Both parameters can be adjusted to reflect the specific properties of different materials. We compute the exact propagator of the theory and employ it to investigate several physical properties. Our analysis focuses on phenomena that arise from the presence of external sources coupled to both the Maxwell and Chern-Simons fields, considering various scenarios. In the Chern-Simons sector, the sources emulate defects in the crystal lattice of the material layer. The main objective of this paper is to present the proposed model and to explore its behavior in the simple context of a single planar material interface. We also suggest possible extensions of the model to more general configurations."

      "summary": "Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires highly processive copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligos that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even if the mutation rate is above the error catastrophe for a physically intact genome."

      "summary": "Inversion asymmetry in bilayer graphene can be tuned by the displacement field. As a result, the band dispersion in biased bilayer graphene acquires flat band regions near the Dirac points along with a non-trivial band geometry. We analyze the effect of inversion symmetry on the critical temperature and superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state of AB-stacked graphene bilayer and on the exciton condensate in double layers formed by two AB-stacked graphene bilayers. The geometric superfluid stiffness in bilayer graphene superconductors is found to be negligible due to the small superconducting gap. Furthermore, we show that the geometric superfluid stiffness is maximized for a constant order parameter. Therefore, it can be neglected in biased bilayer graphene superconductors with any pairing symmetry. However, the displacement field enhances the geometric superfluid stiffness in exciton condensates. It is most prominent at low densities and high displacement fields. A consequence of the geometric superfluid stiffness is a modest enhancement of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature in bilayer graphene's exciton condensate."

      "summary": "The translational motion of anisotropic or self-propelled colloidal particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is characterized by an orientation-dependent (``multiplicative'') noise. As a consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms depending on whether It\\=o's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them in a top-down appraoch from a geometric construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalization constraint of the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the scheme, based on Gaussian random rotations, converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large time step. Due to a favorable prefactor of the discretization error, already the Gaussian scheme allows for integration time steps that are one order of magnitude larger compared to a commonly used algorithm for rotational Brownian dynamics simulations based on projection on the constraining manifold. For torques originating from constant external fields, we prove by virtue of the Fokker-Planck equation that the constructed diffusion process satisfies detailed balance and converges to the correct equilibrium distribution. The analysis is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian motion (i.e., a single rotational diffusion constant), which is relevant for axisymmetric particles and also chemically anisotropic spheres, such as self-propelled Janus particles."

      "summary": "As a fundamental force, friction exerts a profound influence on various aspects of our daily lives across multiple disciplines. To understand why adhesive friction is associated with the contact area, here we investigate the generic sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface by considering re-attachment/healing. We then reveal multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface with the number of these regions generally increasing with the contact area. These adhesive fronts exhibit rich dynamics and their accumulation along an interface can aid each other through re-attachment/healing in friction, apparently resulting in the increase in the calculated shear-off force with the contact area. Based on these findings, we propose a refined law of adhesive friction. Our analysis further suggests that accumulating adhesive fronts along the interface can trigger crack-like propagation of individual fronts at high velocities, which potentially bridges the gap between tribology and fracture mechanics. We also discuss the relevance of this work to earthquake mechanics, which might provide a unified framework that captures key aspects of fault behavior. We expect that this work can supply a fundamental understanding of healing-mediated interfacial phenomena in diverse systems spanning biology, geology, and engineering."

It serves as a basis to understand the fractional, anomalous or spin QHEs, candidates for applications in quantum technology due to their topological properties. For optimizing all these applications it is essential to understand where the current flows inside the Hall bar, a question disputed for decades. We perform multiterminal current measurements on a Hall bar and compare the results with limiting models. We confirm, based on these experiments, that the current flow is chiral for the plateaus of quantized Hall resistance. Everywhere else, including the ranges between plateaus, our results comply with the Drude model, which predicts homogeneous current flow across a homogeneous Hall-bar."

Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids."

We demonstrate that the pO qubit offers distinct advantages in quality factor, gate speed, readout and size. We use a phenomenological, dipole two-level-fluctuator charge noise model to estimate a $T_2^* \\sim 80$ ns. In conjunction with Rabi frequencies of order 10 GHz, an order of magnitude improvement in qubit quality factor is expected relative to state-of-the-art semiconductor spin qubits. The pO qubit features all-electrical control via modulating the dot's eccentricity. We also show how to perform two-qubit gates via the $1/r^5$ quadrupole-quadrupole interaction.

In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature."

      "summary": "The coupling between electronic nematic degrees of freedom and acoustic phonons is known to significantly alter the universality class of a nematic quantum critical point (QCP). While non-Fermi-liquid behaviour emerges in the absence of lattice coupling, the inclusion of interactions with acoustic phonons results in observables such as heat capacity and single-particle scattering rate exhibiting only subleading non-analytic corrections to dominant Fermi-liquid terms. In this work, we demonstrate that the elastocaloric effect (ECE) -- the adiabatic temperature change under varying strain -- and the thermal expansion deviate from this pattern. Despite lattice coupling weakening the singularity of the ECE, it preserves a dominant non-Fermi-liquid temperature dependence. By drawing analogies between nematic systems and field-tuned altermagnets, we further show that similar responses are expected for the ECE near altermagnetic QCPs. We classify the types of piezomagnetic couplings and analyse the regimes arising from field-tuned magnetoelastic interactions. Our findings are shown to be consistent with the scaling theory for elastic quantum criticality and they further emphasize the suitability of the ECE as a sensitive probe near QCPs."

      "summary": "In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon."

To explain this remarkable behavior, Ji et al. proposed the concept of fractional quantum ferroelectricity (FQFE), in which polarization occurs in fractional multiples of a quantum, and argued that this phenomenon violates {\\it conventional} Neumann's principle. In this Letter, we introduce a generalized form of Neumann's principle and demonstrate that both FQFE and conventional ferroelectricity can be consistently described within this unified theoretical framework. We propose a method, based on the generalized Neumann's principle, for the systematic identification of FQFE materials. This approach is straightforward to apply and offers a clear conceptual understanding and deep physical insight for FQFE. Using this method, we determine all symmetry-allowed FQFE cases across the 32 crystallographic point groups. Since practical applications rely on the ability to control polarization, we further show that FQFE can be effectively switched via coupling with conventional polarization. Using HfZnN$_2$ as an illustrative example, we reveal the underlying mechanism of this coupling and outline a strategy to identify other materials with similar switching behavior."

      "summary": "The non-Abelian statistics of Majorana zero modes (MZM) is central to the fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Planar Josephson junctions (PJJ) are a particularly versatile platform to realize robust topological superconductivity hosting MZM over a large parameter space. However, there is a general understanding that such topological superconductivity is limited to a narrow range of the in-plane magnetic field orientations, providing a major obstacle towards scalable and noncollinear network architectures. Here, we uncover that topological superconductivity in PJJ persists under nearly an arbitrary in-plane magnetic field orientation. The apparent collapse of the global gap under misaligned fields originates not from the destruction of topological superconductivity itself, but from the emergent shifted bulk states from other momenta, which obscure the gap and MZM. With spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore the global topological gap and recover MZM. Remarkably, the spatially modulated PJJ renders topological superconductivity robust against the misaligned fields, thereby enabling MZM survival and facilitating their braiding in complex junction networks. We propose a scalable protocol for MZM braiding and fusion with gate or phase control, opening new routes for scalable topological quantum computing."

However, its widespread application is hampered by its relatively high computational cost. Here, we present a well-parallelised implementation of the RPA with localised atomic orbitals and pair-atomic density fitting, which is especially suitable for studying two-dimensional systems. Through a dual $\\textbf{k}$-grid scheme, we achieve fast and reliable convergence of RPA correlation energies to the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate the efficacy of our implementation through an application to the adsorption of CO on MgO(001) using PBE input orbitals (RPA@PBE) Our calculated adsorption energy is in good agreement with previously published RPA@PBE studies, but, as expected, overestimates the experimentally available adsorption energies as well as recent CCSD(T) results."

The aggregation of the molecular layer can be controlled by the deposition parameters and post-deposition annealing to obtain films ranging from amorphous to a highly aggregated state. The molecular layer has a uniaxial structure with excitonic transitions whose transition dipole moments are well defined. The presence of the molecular layer results in an enormous increase in the response of the phototransistor. We further demonstrate that the signal-enhancement is due to p-photodoping of the graphene. The spectroscopic photoresponse suggests that the photodoping via monomers and molecular aggregates takes place differently. Our photodetector is a platform to study the influence of molecular aggregation and order on charge transport processes between aggregated organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials."

      "summary": "Chalcogenide perovskites, particularly II-IV ABS3 compounds, are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic applications. However, these materials frequently exhibit instability in two respects: 1) a preference for structures containing one-dimensional edge- or face-sharing octahedral networks instead of the three-dimensional corner-sharing perovskite framework (polymorphic instability), and (2) a tendency to decompose into competing compositions (hull instability). We evaluate the stability of 81 ABS3 compounds using Density Functional Theory, finding that only BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 are both polymorphically and hull stable, with the NH4CdCl3-type structure being the preferred polymorph for 77% of these compounds. Comparison with existing tolerance factor models demonstrates that these approaches work well for known perovskites but overpredict stability for compositions without published experimental results. Polymorphic stability analysis reveals that perovskite structures are stabilized by strong B-S bonding interactions, while needle structures exhibit minimal B-S covalency, suggesting that electrostatic rather than covalent interactions drive the preference for edge-sharing motifs. Hull stability analysis comparing ABS3 to ABO3 analogues reveals a weaker inductive effect in sulfides as a possible explanation for the scarcity of sulfides compared with oxides. The relative instability of ABS3 compounds is further supported by experimental synthesis attempts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the origins of instability in chalcogenide perovskites and highlight the challenges in expanding this promising materials class beyond the few materials that have been reported to date."

When de-coupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions -- one for each coupled state -- which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust inter-state transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states. A physical analogy can be made between this nonequilibrium system and a multi-phase thermodynamic system, with possible applications in computing, precision sensing, and signal processing."

It is shown that adding potential disorder to this theory, which acts as an unconventional type of random-field disorder, naturally gives rise to the universal theory of strange metals with spatial disorder in both the magnitude and sign of the electron-boson coupling term [A.A. Patel, H. Guo, I. Esterlis and S. Sachdev, Science 381, 790 (2023)]. One difference compared to the original theory, however, is that at non-zero temperatures the disordered spin-stripe model automatically self-averages over the sign of the coupling. We also study the effects of thermal fluctuations in a phenomenological model for the disordered spin density wave state, and find from Monte Carlo simulations that a short anti-ferromagnetic correlation length (order 4-5 lattice constants) already leads to pronounced Fermi arcs in the electronic spectral weight."

Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in nonlinear capacitors or classical time crystals) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. There occurs a dissipative phase transition from a nonconvex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. Our approach thus resolves apparent inconsistencies and provides computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies."

      "summary": "Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \\(G^*\\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \\(G^*\\) for \\(\\omega\\lambda \\alt 1\\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \\(G^*\\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \\(\\omega \\approx \\tau_{s}^{-1}=\\eta_{s}/\\rho_{f}a^{2}\\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\\(t \\ll \\tau_{s}\\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \\(G^*\\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions."

Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between the Neel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles, the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones. The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge conductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$ channels. These findings highlight altermagnet-$p$-wave magnet junctions as a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure."

We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed."

The strong collision model, based on a Gaussian-Markovian process, is commonly used to account for dynamical effects. Yet, it remains limited in describing systems where the local field undergoes discrete state changes. To address this, I introduce a generalized two-state strong collision model that explicitly incorporates transitions between distinct local field environments during fluctuations. This extension allows for a more accurate representation of dynamical effects, particularly in systems where each collision alters the underlying static polarisation function. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented, and the model's applicability is demonstrated and discussed across relevant physical systems -- including low-dimensional magnets, systems with dynamic disorder and ion and muon diffusion. These results offer an enhanced framework for interpreting data in complex materials and extend the method's reach to a broader class of dynamical phenomena in condensed matter physics."

To elucidate how the traveling wave of the ERK kinase signal directs collective migration, we constructed the mechanical model of the epithelial cell monolayer by considering the signal-dependent coordination of contractile stress and cellular orientation. The proposed model was studied by using an optogenetically-controlled cell system where we found that local signal activation induces changes in cell density and orientation with the direction of propagation. The net motion of the cell population occurred relative to the wave, and the migration velocity showed a maximum in resonance with the velocity of the ERK signal wave.

Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise.

Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments."

Using a single layer of graphene nanoribbons as a templating layer, we obtain an aligned layer of aggregated molecules. The molecular layer displays anisotropic optical properties resembling those of a biaxial crystal. The anisotropic excitonic component in the cavity results in strongly polarization-dependent light-matter interaction and in increased Rabi-energies. The increased light-matter interaction is possibly due to reduced molecular disorder in the templated molecular layer. This conclusion is supported by an analysis based on a multi-oscillator model. We further use photoluminescence microspectroscopy to demonstrate that the light-matter coupling is spatially homogeneous. Our study introduces molecular templating to strong light-matter studies. The reduced disorder of the system as a consequence of templating is highly beneficial for engineering light-matter interaction."

Focusing on the liquid condensation of a Lennard-Jones gas, we used state of the art rare event sampling simulations to precisely characterize the nucleation event emphasizing the specific features of the critical cluster. Our numerical results indicate a simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a 2-variable nucleation theory. Our model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties. Furthermore, our model provides a qualitatively more accurate representation of nucleation near the spinodal regime. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework highlights the limitations of CNT and more recent theories while offering a robust foundation for its refinement."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We introduce the concept of \"ajar systems\" as an intermediate case between closed and open systems, where the time scale for charge exchange with the environment is parametrically larger than all other characteristic time scales. The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \\times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Polarization-encoded spin-photon interfaces constitute promising candidates for the development of stationary nodes used as photon receivers, for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. Here we introduce a time-resolved tomography approach which allows observing the dynamics of an electron spin, in a semiconductor quantum dot, mapped onto the dynamics of the polarization state of reflected photons. Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The Fe pressure-temperature phase diagram and its melting line have a wide range of applications, including providing constraints for iron-core planetary models. We propose an equation of state (EOS) model based on the interstitial theory of simple condensed matter (ITCM), as suggested by A.V. Granato. When applied to Fe, this model enables the extrapolation of measured melting lines to the conditions of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB). The ITCM describes the solid-liquid phase transition in metals as resulting from a strong structural perturbation due to a high concentration of interstitial-like defects. The strong nonlinearity of their self-interaction causes the stabilization of this interstitial-rich phase. The original model is expanded to describe melting over a wide range of pressures and temperatures rather than focusing on a specific isobaric transition. Using this model, we fit the measured melting data, extrapolate it to cover ICB conditions, and develop a multiphase equation of state that encompasses this regime. The model is used to explain contradictory data regarding the location of the melting line, resulting from a novel phase transition between two separate liquid phases, specifically between FCC-based and HCP-based liquids. This additional liquid phase offers a new interpretation of the previously suggested near-melting high-pressure phase and may also provide a solution to the inner core nucleation paradox."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic\") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\\log (N/\\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\\log\\log(N/\\epsilon))+2^{O(k\\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \\geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions."

Now, using the nonlinear Hall effect in thin films of the topological crystalline insulator SnTe, wireless, zero-bias rectification is demonstrated across megahertz to terahertz frequencies and with sensitivity down to ambient power levels."
