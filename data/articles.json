We have implemented this algorithm in Python and made it available for free under the name LIMPID. To demonstrate its performance, we analyze depth-resolved Doppler-Broadening Spectroscopy measurements of a Cu layer on a Si substrate, achieving excellent agreement with the experimental profiles. The LIMPID tool enhances the reproducibility and comparability of positron defect characterization measurements across different research groups."

      "summary": "The entropy that an insulating magnetic material releases upon cooling can reveal important information about the properties of spin states in that material. In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat capacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states continuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the Ising model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy associated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically the values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered systems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally measured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$, $FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from the classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be connected. This comparison suggests that the lowest-energy states of higher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described in terms of doublet states on individual magnetic sites. Our analyses demonstrate how the values of entropy can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF compounds and call for more accurate thermodynamic measurement in GF magnetic materials."

We extend quantum information measures such as coherent information beyond the Nishimori line and establish them as sharp indicators of phase transitions. We derive exact inequalities for several generalized measures, demonstrating that each attains its extremum along the Nishimori line. Using a fermionic transfer matrix method, we compute these quantities in the 2d $\\pm J$ random-bond Ising model-corresponding to a surface code under bit-flip noise-on system sizes up to $512$ and over $10^7$ disorder realizations. All critical points extracted from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at $p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest finite-size effects. We further analyze the domain-wall free energy distribution and confirm its scale invariance at the multicritical point."

      "summary": "The paper presents the theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions with equal Fermi velocities and effective masses in all layers. The theory takes into account phase gradients in superconducting layers commonly ignored in the past. At $T=0$ the current-phase relation was derived for any thickness $L$ of the normal layer in the model of the steplike pairing potential model analytically. The obtained current-phase relation is essentially different from that in theory neglecting phase gradients, especially in the limit $L\\to 0$ (short junction). The analysis resolves the problem with the charge conservation law in the steplike pairing potential model. The current-phase relation at temperatures exceeding the energy spacing between Andreev levels but less than the critical temperature was also calculated numerically. The current at these temperatures is temperature independent and decreases with growing $L$ as $1/L^4$. The previous theory predicted the current exponentially decreasing with growing $T$ and $L$. Possible implications of the analysis for planar junctions with non-equal Fermi velocities and for non-planar junctions (narrow normal bridge between two bulk superconductors) are also discussed."

      "summary": "Self-closing assembly is prone to polymorphism due to thermally-excited bending fluctuations, which permit the formation of off-target assemblies at the point of self-closure. One way to overcome this source of polymorphism is to use templated growth, a process in which assembly initiates from a precisely-defined seed rather than by spontaneous nucleation. We explore this approach to quelling polymorphism in the self-closing assembly of cylindrical tubules assembled from DNA-origami subunits with user-specified inter-subunit binding angles and specific interactions. We develop two strategies to create seeds with precisely-defined diameters and helicity: 1) using multicomponent assembly; and 2) purifying a specific seed-type from a polymorphic mixture using gel electrophoresis and gel extraction. By tuning the seed and monomer concentrations, and adjusting the assembly temperature, we determine the conditions under which tubules grow from the seed while avoiding spontaneous nucleation. We observe that templated tubules tend to follow the guidance of the seed, thereby increasing the selectivity of the target geometry. Also, we find that by tuning the diameter of the seed, one can template the growth of monodisperse tubules over a range of target diameters, even while using a single monomer type with a single preferred local curvature. Our results demonstrate that employing precisely defined seeds to guide assembly can significantly decrease polymorphism in self-closing assembly in a controllable and economical way."

We present an Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) method that integrates first-principles defect properties and experimentally measured parameters into a device model to dynamically simulate the defect chemistry in semiconductors. For a silicon-doped gallium arsenide (GaAs) material, we showcase three capabilities: (i) Fermi level $E_F$ movement including its component electron and hole Fermi levels, (ii) dynamical charge equilibration with the arsenic vacancy serving as an example, and a (iii) diffusion-driven reaction between Coulomb attracted gallium interstitial ($Ga_i$) and arsenic vacancy ($v_{As}$). Governed by charge carrier reactions, the electron and hole Fermi levels remained dissimilar until equilibrium was achieved at $E_F\\approx1.32$ eV. The equilibrium Fermi level was verified by successfully identifying $v_{As}^{3-}$ as the most populated charge state within the arsenic vacancy defect. Lastly, a Coulomb attraction, created by the shifted Fermi level and the charge equilibration process, between $Ga_i^{1+}$ and $v_{As}^{3-}$ resulted in the formation of a doubly negative gallium antisite ($Ga_{As}^{2-}$). The AIDE method can access experimentally inaccessible short-time and low-concentration regimes, is generalizable to other more complex systems (e.g., indium gallium arsenide), and, after solving open problems in GaAs, will serve as a virtual experiment to bound estimates for difficult-to-measure physical quantities."

Here, we consider both aspects of recrystallization of irradiated GaAs. We find that structural evolution occurs in two stages, a low temperature regime characterized by slow, epitaxial front propagation and a high-temperature regime above dominated by rapid growth and formation of dense nanotwin networks. We link aspects of this structural evolution to local ordering, or paracrystallinity, within the amorphous phase. Critically, the electronic recovery of the materials is not commensurate with this structural evolution. The electronic properties of the recrystallized material deviate further from the pristine material than do those of the amorphous phase, highlighting the incongruence between structural and electronic recovery and the contrasting impact of loss of long range order versus localized defects on the functionality of semiconducting materials."

However, comparing SHG performance across materials remains challenging as the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$ spans several orders of magnitude and strongly depends on the band gap $E_g$. To address this, we empirically validate a theoretical upper bound on $\\chi^{(2)}$ using new databases of \\textit{ab initio}-computed nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We then formulate a normalized descriptor, $\\hat{d}$, which expresses the NLO response of a material relative to the band gap-dependent physical limit. We show that $\\hat{d}$ exhibits a similar distribution across a wide range of band gap energies. This universality supports the use of $\\hat{d}$ as a robust, generalizable descriptor for data-driven and chemistry-informed machine learning models of NLO response, enabling accelerated materials discovery and optimization across broad application frequencies."

      "summary": "Designing materials with targeted properties remains challenging due to the vastness of chemical space and the scarcity of property-labeled data. While recent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design, most approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new target property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a hybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through a modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into two steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired properties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer model (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular hybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under small-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95% validity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57% in validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining effective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully performed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including CoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models have not. This work presents a data-efficient, generalizable approach to the inverse design of diverse MOFs and highlights the potential of modular inverse design workflows for broader materials discovery."

Commutative algebra is a branch of abstract algebra that has been rarely applied in data and material sciences. We introduce the first ever commutative algebra modeling and prediction in materials science. Specifically, category-specific commutative algebra (CSCA) is proposed as a new framework for MOF representation and learning. It integrates element-based categorization with multiscale algebraic invariants to encode both local coordination motifs and global network organization of MOFs. These algebraically consistent, chemically aware representations enable compact, interpretable, and data efficient modeling of MOF properties such as Henry's constants and uptake capacities for common gases. Compared to traditional geometric and graph-based approaches, CSCA achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy while substantially improving interpretability and stability across data sets. By aligning commutative algebra with the chemical hierarchy, the CSCA establishes a rigorous and generalizable paradigm for understanding structure and property relationships in porous materials and provides a nonlinear algebra-based framework for data-driven material discovery."

In the uniform situation, we discover that the ring soliton is always driven away from its initial location, and moves towards the edge due to a curvature-induced effective potential. The ring soliton is impossible to remain static at any location in the uniform system. To balance the density difference between the ring soliton's two sides, a harmonic trap is introduced, which can exert an effect to counterbalances the curvature-induced effective potential. This enables the ring dark soliton to become a stable state at a particular equilibrium position r_s, where the free energy of the ring dark soliton just reaches the maximum value. Once ring soliton is slightly deviated from r_s, some stable periodic oscillations of ring soliton around r_s will turn out. Some dissipation will possibly occur to ring soliton once its minimum radius is comparable to the healing length of soliton's Friedel oscillation. This dissipation will increase the oscillation amplitude and finally make the ring soliton decay into sound ripples. Our research lays the groundwork for a more in-depth understanding of the stable mechanism of a ring dark soliton in the future."

Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity, identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices."

      "summary": "Understanding the role of cap structure during the nucleation and growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is essential for achieving chirality-controlled synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel and intuitive algorithm to determine the chirality of nascent carbon caps by tracking the relative shifts of six pentagons within a topological coordinate system. Based on this algorithm, we propose three routes of pentagon shifts for the chirality mutations from armchair (AC) to near-AC caps, namely the transverse shift (n,n) to (n+1,n-1), inward shift (n,n) to (n-1), and outward shift (n,n) to (n+1,n), can occur according to the energy profiles calculated based on the density function theory (DFT), providing a new perspective to explain the experimental abundance of near-AC SWCNTs. After that, we construct 24 representative short caps and long SWCNTs with different chiralities and symmetries, and perform DFT calculations to evaluate their thermodynamic stability and deformation behaviors on flat Ni(111) surfaces and curved Ni55 particle, respectively. The results reveal that cap topology and catalyst curvature together induce dual deformations that significantly influence the formation and interface energies. Notably, AC and near-AC caps exhibit superior flexibility and robust energetic advantages, especially the (6,6) cap with C6v symmetry. A linear correlation between cap-induced deformation and formation energy is established through a defined shape factor, highlighting the interaction between cap structure and catalyst interface as a key driver of chirality selection. This study theoretically reveals the cap evolution mechanism and lays the foundation for the rational design of SWCNT growth strategies."

Under substantial geometric frustration from a double-layered triangular lattice, it exhibits two-step specific heat transition peaks at 6.22 K and 2.11 K, respectively. Its ultrahigh specific heat and broad two-step transition temperature range effectively bridge the gap between commercially used high-heat-capacity materials. Experimental verification shows that when Gd2O2Se is combined with Er3Ni and HoCu2 in the Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler, the cooling efficiency of the pulse tube increases by 66.5 % at 7 K, and the minimum achievable temperature reaches 5.85 K. These results indicate that Gd2O2Se is an ideal magnetic regenerative material for space cooling"

      "summary": "In materials with broken inversion symmetry, nonreciprocal magneto-transport (NRMT) manifests as a bilinear dependence of charge conductivity on applied electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields. This phenomenon is deeply rooted in symmetry and electronic quantum geometry, holding promise for novel rectification and detector technologies. Existing experimental studies generally attribute NRMT to Zeeman-driven mechanisms and exhibit quadratic scaling with conductivity. Here, we report a previously unknown NRMT microscopic mechanism - Lorentz skew scattering (LSK) - revealed through the discovery of an unprecedented quartic scaling law of NRMT as well as quantitative agreement between theory and experiment in BiTeBr. LSK emerges from the interplay of Lorentz force and skew scattering, bridging classical field effect to quantum scattering effect on the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that the LSK dominates NRMT in BiTeBr, and elucidate that this dominance over other possible contributions stems from high mobility and strong Rashba splitting. The finding of LSK mechanism is of unique importance because it unveils the leading NRMT effect in high-mobility systems and suggests a universal principle towards strong NRMT by enhancing electronic relaxation time in topological materials, rendering a new designing idea for low-dissipation rectifiers and high-performance quantum electronics."

      "summary": "Quantum spin liquids are quantum phases of matter featuring collectively entangled states and emergent fractional many-body excitations. While methods exist to probe three-dimensional quantum spin liquids experimentally, these techniques lack the sensitivity to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids. This seriously hampers the study of potential monolayer quantum spin liquid candidates such as $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) have recently been suggested as promising probes of the quantum spin liquid state, as they can access the spinon spectrum through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). In this work, we employ this approach on the quantum spin liquid candidate material 1T-TaSe$_2$ and directly measure its low-energy inelastic excitations. We observe the emergence of a $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction driven by the substrate, equivalent spectroscopy across all spin sites and coexistence of zero and finite energy excitations. We show that these observations are consistent with a modulated $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ spin liquid ground state.

      "summary": "Axial or circularly polarized phonons are collective lattice vibrations with angular momentum. Over the past decade they have emerged as a promising mechanism for the manipulation of magnetism, in parallel to well established optical protocols. In particular, coherent axial phonons were shown to induce magnetization in materials without spin-ordering, making them a viable tool for ultrafast magnetic switching. The experimental evidence suggests that the size of this magnetization is significant, opening a new research area on the phono-magnetic effect. Remarkably, the coupling of axial phonons to magnetism has been observed a broad class of materials, pointing to a universal nature of the underlying mechanisms. In this review article, we present the recent progress in the field. We give an introduction to the phenomenological perspective and an overview of the experimental evidence for the magnetization emerging from axial phonons, which includes discussing the observations of phonon Zeeman effect, the magneto-optical Kerr effect and the proximity-induced magnetization switching. We present recently proposed microscopic theories for the phono-magnetic effects, based on perturbation theory, adiabatic motion and Floquet theory as well as the emergence of the phonon magnetic moment due to artificial gauge fields or inertial effects. This summary allows us to see correspondences between the seemingly different theoretical approaches, facilitating a more complete perspective of the effect."

      "summary": "Metal hydrides remain an intriguing alternative to conventional gaseous and liquid hydrogen storage methods, offering high volumetric storage density and enhanced hydrogen storage safety at ambient conditions. In this regard, the intermetallic compound FeTi is one of the most promising storage materials. However, its widespread industrial application remains challenging due to the need for activation, slow initial kinetics, large hysteresis, and high material costs. In this study, we aim to overcome these limitations by devising an alternative synthesis pathway to prepare nanoporous and ultra-fine porous FeTi with controlled grain and ligament sizes, allowing us to study the obtained well-defined microstructures in detail. In particular, we observe the confinement of the FeTi phase by surface oxides, which can be correlated with the hydrogen sorption properties of the respective material. These experimental results are further supported by an analytical model allowing the calculation of the absorption pressure as a function of microstructure-dependent elastic stresses. Additionally, we show that such stresses also influence the absorption-desorption hysteresis. This study lays the groundwork for the controlled and systematic study of the processing-structure-properties relations in metal hydrides and FeTi in particular, thereby paving the way to cost-effective and efficient hydrogen storage solutions based on metal hydrides."

Two formulations are proposed: implicit transfer involves pretraining chemical language models on multimodal embeddings, whereas explicit transfer suggests generating crystal structures and implementing structure-aware predictors. The proposed approaches were benchmarked on LLM4Mat-Bench and MatBench tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 25 out of 32 cases. In addition, we demonstrated how another modeling aspect of chemical language models - interpretability - benefits from applying a game-theoretic approach, which is able to incorporate high-order feature interactions."

In this Letter, K. Le Hur Europhys. Lett., 49 (6), pp. 768-774 (2000), I introduced a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with such a (spin) bound state in a Luther-Emery wire representing then a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave superconducting state. This method is general and show how Majorana fermions at zero energy, i.e. Majorana zero modes, can take place in a superconducting wire model from the two-channel Kondo effect. Within these two channels (wires), the Luther-Emery form of the superconducting term can be reached within the weak-coupling attractive limit. Due to the interest in Majorana zero modes from magnetic impurities interacting with an s-wave superconductor, I take time to analyze zero-energy edge solutions in my model and present a correspondence with the p-wave superconducting wire in the topological phase through alternatives versions of the quantum field theory. I develop the relation between the edge magnetic susceptibility and the local capacitance measure in a p-wave superconducting wire. I elaborate on the idea that Majorana zero modes, i.e. free Majorana fermions, can be realized with magnetic impurities bridging the gap between two s-wave superconducting wires. The spin gap and the resonance with the impurity can protect the free Majorana solutions when including perturbations."

      "summary": "The nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can enable rectification and energy harvesting, and its control by external fields, including gate, strain and magnetic field, has been pursued intensively. However, existing tuning pathways rely predominantly on fully quantum mechanical effects and are typically inefficient, resulting in weak NHE signals that limit further progress. In this work, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called Lorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This field-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a pronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches up to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE originating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a record-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\\mu}mV-1{\\Omega}-1) near van Hove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude larger than all previously reported NHEs. Our findings establish an efficient, magnetic-field-driven route to giant Hall rectification in high-mobility materials, offering a broadly applicable paradigm for modulating the NHE beyond electrostatic gating."

We apply this approach to NiO by constructing two potentials: one based on the Born model of ionic solids and another using a reference-free modified embedded atom method. Both potentials include magnetoelastic interactions and are validated against Density Functional Theory calculations, showing excellent agreement in mechanical and magnetic properties at zero temperature. These models enable large-scale simulations of magnetoelastic phenomena in antiferromagnets and open avenues for molecular dynamics studies involving coupled electric and magnetic fields in metal oxides."

Of similar importance is the Becker-London effect, i.e. generation of magnetic field inside a rotating superconductor. Hirsch has recently pointed out that, within the conventional theory of superconductivity, the question about how these effects are generated dynamically has not even been asked yet. Here we fill in this gap in the literature by a detailed study of the evolution of the electromagnetic field for both of these effects. To this end, we solve the Maxwell equations supplemented by the simplest conventional constitutive equation for a superconductor, namely the London equation. We demonstrate that, contrary to the expectations of Hirsch, the conventional theory does correctly describe the dynamics of both, the Meissner and the Becker-London effect. We find that the dynamics of the studied processes is quite rich and interesting even at this level of description."

This multiplexed, non-destructive approach allows quantum sensors to characterize the material platform they inhabit. Focusing on CVD-grown diamond, we uncover significant deviations from random distributions, including an unexpectedly high occurrence of closely spaced clusters comprising two or more NVs. These findings suggest non-Poissonian formation dynamics and point to spatially correlated defect generation mechanisms. Beyond offering insight into diamond growth and NV center formation, our approach enables the scalable identification of naturally occurring NV clusters - configurations that are promising for entanglement-assisted quantum information protocols and correlated sensing - and establishes a path toward structural and electronic defect analysis in various material hosts at the single-emitter level."

In this theory, spinons are described by a non-linear sigma model, while chargons are treated as fermions at a mean-field level. We investigate the instability to a superconducting state SC*, arising from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) where pairing between chargons occurs. Consistent with previous studies, our analysis reveals a coexisting phase characterized by both magnetic and superconducting order for the chargons. The central contribution of this work is the calculation of the feedback of superconductivity on spatial and temporal spin stiffnesses, thereby quantifying its impact on spin fluctuations. Our key finding is that superconductivity significantly suppresses these spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin fluctuations. This enhancement suggests that superconductivity can play a crucial role in stabilizing quantum disorder against long-range magnetic ordering."

We discover this slot plasma excitation exhibiting square-root dispersion.

The debate over whether genuine DQCP exists in physical SU(2) spin systems or the transition is weakly first-order has persisted for many years. In this letter, we construct a non-Hermitian easy-plane $J$-$Q$ model and perform sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation to explore the impact of non-Hermitian microscopic interactions on the transition that potentially features a DQCP. Our results demonstrate that the intensity of the first-order transitions significantly diminishes with the amplification of non-Hermitian interactions, serving as numerical evidence to support the notion that the transition in $J$-$Q$ model is quasi-critical, possibly in the vicinity of the fixed point governing DQCP in the complex plane, described by a non-unitary conformal field theory (CFT). The non-Hermitian interaction facilitates the approach towards such a complex fixed point in the parameter regime. Furthermore, our QMC study on the non-Hermitian J-Q model opens a new route to numerically investigating the nature of complex CFT in the microscopic model."

      "summary": "Plasma-activated bonding of SiCN films offers high bonding strength at the hybrid-bonding interface, thereby enhancing mechanical reliability. Although experimental studies have shown that the interfacial bonding properties of SiCN films vary with SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters, a clear correlation between these parameters and the resulting bonding properties has not yet been established. This study presents an atomistic investigation of SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding with controlled SiCN composition and plasma fluence, which performs O2 plasma surface activation, surface hydroxylation, direct bonding, post-bonding annealing, and debonding using reactive molecular dynamics. The structural characterization of the plasma-activated SiCN surface, including density of various covalent bonds and surface roughness, exhibits composition- and plasma fluence-dependent chemical and morphological modification. Bonding energy evaluated from atomic traction-separation responses in cohesive zone volume elements (CZVE) during debonding simulations shows a positive correlation with the interfacial Si-O-Si density. Since the interfacial Si-O-Si density reflects the combined effects of these chemical and morphological modifications, the dependence of bonding energy on composition and plasma fluence is successfully elucidated by the structural characterization. These results establish an atomic-level material-process-property relationship and offer practical guidance for optimizing SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters for SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding."

      "summary": "Magnetic and polar skyrmions exhibit topologically protected quasiparticle behavior, including emergent fields, deformation, and the formation of a densely packed skyrmion lattice, beyond conventional domain configurations described by Kittel's law. Analogous to atomic crystals, lattice defects, especially dislocations and their associated strain fields, are crucial for understanding the lattice behavior of skyrmions; however, their features and roles remain insufficiently understood. Here, we show that magnetic skyrmion dislocations develop a core-split structure due to a significant skyrmion elongation up to 180% of their original length, reaching a topological transition from a single skyrmion to two half-skyrmions. Despite such a distinct structure, the long-range strain fields around the dislocation perfectly obey conventional Volterra's elasticity theory, in contrast to polar skyrmion lattices, where skyrmion deformations cause a breakdown of the elasticity theory. Furthermore, an energetic analysis shows that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction drives the large skyrmion deformation of the dislocation core. Our findings not only clarify the coexistence of topological core-reconstruction and a robust long-range elastic field of dislocations in magnetic skyrmion lattices, but also reveal that magnetic and electric domains, long regarded as dual and analogous, exhibit fundamental differences when extended into the regime of collective topological quasiparticles."

As an emergent material candidate for such an architecture, we propose a strained Weyl semimetal based spin-orbit-torque random-access memory (SWSM-SOTRAM) device. The spin-orbit torque (SOT) originates from two mechanisms: (1) the inverse spin Galvanic effect (iSGE), which generates nonequilibrium in-plane spin accumulation at interfaces, and (2) a bulk spin Hall effect (SHE), which produces a transverse spin current carrying out-of-plane spin angular momentum. The latter is tunable via an exchange Zeeman field. Both effects are evaluated using the tight-binding model coupled with a nonequilibrium Green's function (TB-NEGF) formalism for quantum transport. Information write is achieved through SOT switching of an out-of-plane free magnet. A piezo attached to a magnetostrictive selector modulates the strain in the latter, leading to the rotation of the magnetization and hence the exchange Zeeman field exerted on the Weyl semimetal. This strain-controlled exchange field enables the symmetry tuning of the Weyl semimetal and modulation of its spin Hall effect. The TB-NEGF calculations of SHE and iSGE, combined with Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of magnetization dynamics, establish the SOT switching mechanism and demonstrate a pathway toward the SWSM-SOTRAM PIM device."

The Lagrangian of this system includes a non-inertial correction due to centrifugal field coupling. By imposing gauge symmetry and treating it as a full gauge theory, the Lagrangian is extended to include Berry connection and curvature terms. Upon integrating out the geometric gauge field, the effective action is obtained. This leads to the emergence of a repulsive, long-range effective interaction in the Lagrangian. Explicitly, in the non-inertial frame of the observer, the geometric gauge invariance effectively leads to a repulsive Coulomb-interaction in momentum space. In real space, the inertial repulsion manifests in a $1/\\vert r\\vert^{2}$ potential, which is symmetric about the origin of rotation and mirrors charge-dipole interaction."

While the quantum impurity problem has been extensively studied with ultracold atomic gases, repulsive polarons in the strongly correlated regime have remained elusive. Typically, the impurity atoms bind into molecules or rapidly decay into deeper lying states before they can acquire an appreciable dressing cloud. Here, we report on the realization of polarons in a strongly repulsive quasi-two-dimensional quantum gas. Using a superfluid of $^6$Li dimers, we introduce impurities by promoting a small fraction of the dimers into higher levels of the transverse confining potential. These novel synthetic-spin polarons give access to the strongly repulsive regime where common decay channels are suppressed. We extract key polaron properties - the energy, quasiparticle residue, and effective mass - using trap modulation and Bragg spectroscopy. Our measurements are well captured by a microscopic T-matrix approach and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, revealing deviations from mean-field predictions. In particular, we measure a significant enhancement of the polaron mass, with values exceeding twice the free dimer mass. Our demonstration of a stable repulsive Bose polaron establishes a platform for studying impurity physics in low-dimensional and strongly correlated systems."

The high resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of planar defects in the lattice of the studied single crystals. Using a combination of microstructural and DFT analysis we demonstrated that a single planar nano-defects forms a layer of a distinct phase EuSnAs2, that is different from the EuSn2As2 phase of the bulk lattice. The smaller distance between Eu layers in the planar nano-defect promotes formation of local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of the Eu atoms. On average, the planar defects form a weak ferromagnetic phase in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) host lattice. The obtained results explain several puzzling features in magnetic properties of A-type AFM materials: the nonlinear magnetization in low in-plane fields, ferromagnetic-type hysteresis in low field, and the upturn of the magnetic susceptibility in the AFM state at temperatures approaching zero."

In this letter, we overcome this limitation by introducing a momentum compensation mechanism mediated by discrete translational symmetry. Interfacial reciprocal lattice vectors provide momentum compensation during phonon tunneling and induce asymmetric mode matching, resulting in negative refraction without requiring strong dispersion anisotropy or a negative-curvature band. Using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we demonstrate coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures. This general mechanism enables active control of phonon flow via interfacial design, paving the way for applications in atomic-scale phonon lenses and directional thermal transport."

Despite this growing interest, the realization of real Chern insulators in intrinsic altermagnetic systems has rarely been reported. In this work, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify monolayer Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O as a novel class of two-dimensional altermagnetic real Chern insulators. We demonstrate that these materials possess altermagnetic ground states and host a nontrivial mirror real Chern number, leading to the emergence of symmetry-protected zero-dimensional corner states. Notably, these corner modes are spin-polarized, giving rise to a unique spin-corner coupling effect. We further show that the real Chern insulating phases and their associated corner states remain robust against spin-orbit coupling, as well as under both uniaxial and biaxial strain. Additionally, these materials exhibit pronounced linear dichroism and strong optical absorption. Our findings uncover the novel topological character of Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O, establishing them as promising platforms for exploring real Chern insulators in altermagnetic systems."

Single-walled CNTs with (10,0) zigzag chirality were functionalized with hydroxyl groups at concentrations of 5-25% and evaluated for interactions with glyphosate in five different ionization states (G1-G5) corresponding to pH-dependent protonation. Using semi-empirical tight-binding methods implemented in xTB software, molecular geometry optimization, electronic property calculations, topological analyses via Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), and molecular dynamics simulations at 300K were performed. Results demonstrate that functionalization significantly enhances adsorption capacity, with binding energies becoming increasingly negative at higher OH concentrations and with more deprotonated glyphosate forms (G4 and G5). Electronic coupling analyses reveal optimized charge reactivity and transport in systems with 20-25% OH functionalization. Topological characterization identified 477 bond critical points, confirming donor-acceptor interactions with strong covalent contributions, particularly in highly functionalized systems. Radial distribution function profiles from molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that functionalization promotes spatial organization on nanotube surfaces, increasing contact regions and reducing molecular mobility. Systems with moderate interactions (CNT+OHx+G1 and CNT+OHx+G3) present environmentally and economically viable solutions, enabling adsorbent regeneration and reuse. The findings indicate that OH-functionalized carbon nanotubes show significant promise for glyphosate detection and capture applications in environmental monitoring and remediation, regardless of the pesticide's ionization state."

The resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator.

      "summary": "There is a growing interest in identifying the origin of single-photon emission in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with proposed candidates including boron and nitrogen vacancies as well as carbon substitutional dopants. Because photon emission intensity often increases with sample thickness, hBN flakes used in these studies commonly exceed 30 atomic layers. To identify potential emitters at the atomic scale, annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) is frequently employed. However, due to the intrinsic AA' stacking of hBN with vertically alternating boron and nitrogen atoms, this approach is complicated even in few-layer systems. Here, we demonstrate using STEM image simulations and experiments that, even under idealized conditions, the intensity differences between boron- and nitrogen-dominated columns and carbon substitutions become indistinguishable at thicknesses beyond 17 atomic layers (ca. 6 nm). While vacancy-type defects can remain detectable at somewhat larger thicknesses, also their detection becomes unreliable at thicknesses typically used in photonic studies. We further show that common residual aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can lead to artificial contrast differences between columns, which may result in misidentification of atomic defects. We systematically study the effects of non-radially symmetric aberrations on multilayer hBN and demonstrate that even small residual threefold astigmatism can significantly distort the STEM contrast, leading to misleading interpretations."

This approach significantly reduces the overhead for data referencing, movement, and synchronization. Relative to the efficient CPU implementation in the open-source package Perturbo (v2.2.0), used as a baseline, this approach achieves a speed-up of 40 times for both transport and nonequilibrium dynamics on GPU hardware, and achieves nearly linear scaling up to 100 GPUs. The novel data structure can be generalized to other electron interactions and scattering processes. We released this GPU implementation in the latest public version (v3.0.0) of Perturbo. The new MPI+OpenMP+GPU parallelization enables sweeping studies of e-ph physics and electron dynamics in conventional and quantum materials, and prepares Perturbo for exascale supercomputing platforms."

      "summary": "We present an open-source Julia-based software toolkit for solving the phase problem using dual-space iterative algorithms. The toolkit is specifically designed for aperiodic crystals and quasicrystals, supporting general space group symmetries in arbitrary dimensions. A key feature is the symmetry-breaking anti-aliasing sampling scheme, optimized for computational efficiency when working with strongly anisotropic diffraction data, common for quasicrystals. This scheme avoids sampling redundancy caused by symmetry constraints, imposed during phasing iterations. The toolkit includes a reference implementation of the charge flipping algorithm and also allows users to implement custom phasing algorithms with fine-grained control over the iterative process."

      "summary": "Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is employed to study the electronic structure of bulk TiSe2 before and after doping with potassium impurities. A splitting in the conduction band into two branches is observed after room-temperature deposition. The splitting energy increases to approximately 130 meV when the sample is cooled to 40 K. One branch exhibits a non-dispersive two-dimensional feature, while other one shows the characteristics of three dimensional bulk band dispersion. Core level spectroscopy suggests that the K impurities predominantly occupy the intercalated sites within the van derWaals gap. The results indicate the formation of a quasi-freestandingTiSe2 layer. Additionally, doping completely suppresses the periodic lattice distortion in the surface region. These findings are further supported by density functional theory calculations, which compare the band structure of monolayer and bulk TiSe2 with experimental data. Thus, the dimensional and intrinsic electronic properties of 1T-TiSe2 can be controlled through the intercalation procedure used in this work."

Additionally, we demonstrate experimental access to and control over non-ergodic relaxation dynamics, where states in the (nominally) thermal region of the energy spectrum retain memory of the initial state, via the manipulation of spinor phases, enabling the study of non-ergodic thermalization dynamics connected to quantum scarring."

In these materials, canted antiferromagnetism can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and produce a Weyl semimetallic state. CaMnBi$_2$ was proposed to realize this behavior below $T^{*}\\sim 50$ K, where anomalies in resistivity and optical conductivity were reported. We investigate single-crystal CaMnBi$_{2}$ using polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the underlying crystal and magnetic structures. The results show that the observed anomalies do not originate from spin canting or weak ferromagnetism; no measurable uniform Mn spin canting is detected. Instead, CaMnBi$_2$ undergoes a coupled structural and magnetic symmetry-lowering transition at $T^{*} = 46(2)$ K, from a tetragonal lattice with C-type antiferromagnetism to an orthorhombic phase with unit-cell doubling along the $c$ axis and minimal impact on magnetism. Analysis of superlattice peak intensities and lattice distortion reveals a continuous second-order transition governed by a single order parameter. The refined atomic displacements correspond to a zigzag bond-order-wave (BOW) modulation of Bi-Bi bonds, consistent with an electronically driven Peierls-type instability in the Dirac-electron Bi layer, long anticipated by Hoffmann and co-workers [W.~Tremel and R.~Hoffmann, \\textit{J.

In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\\sqrt{\\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\\\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the $N^\\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy."

When prior information is available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods, albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these trade-offs using a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including both circuit depth and sample complexity."

As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched N\\'eel state from R\\'enyi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental R\\'enyi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times.

Yet little is known theoretically about the impact of Sobolev training -- regression with both function and gradient data -- on the generalization error of highly overparameterized predictive models in high dimensions. In this paper, we obtain a precise characterization of this training modality for random feature (RF) models in the limit where the number of trainable parameters, input dimensions, and training data tend proportionally to infinity. Our model for Sobolev training reflects practical implementations by sketching gradient data onto finite dimensional subspaces. By combining the replica method from statistical physics with linearizations in operator-valued free probability theory, we derive a closed-form description for the generalization errors of the trained RF models. For target functions described by single-index models, we demonstrate that supplementing function data with additional gradient data does not universally improve predictive performance. Rather, the degree of overparameterization should inform the choice of training method. More broadly, our results identify settings where models perform optimally by interpolating noisy function and gradient data."

Arbitrary, lossy, and spatially inhomogeneous photonic environments are represented by a minimal set of interacting modes fitted to their spectral density, while geometry-dependent molecular properties are computed on the fly. Applications to few-molecule strong coupling show that strong coupling persists when molecular degrees of freedom and disorder are included for the chosen system consisting of a nanoparticle dimer coupled to multiple emitters. At the same time, symmetry-protected degeneracies of two-level models are lifted. The framework further reveals how spatial field inhomogeneity and molecular disorder shape cavity-mediated energy transfer, illustrated for an HBQ-Methylene Blue donor-acceptor combination in a five-emitter system."

Phase-sensitive THz detection is currently achieved using nonlinear crystals or external interferometers and photomixers. However, the former approach requires femtosecond pulsed radiation, and all approaches suffer from a large footprint and sensitive alignment. Here, we demonstrate a graphene-enabled, on-chip, integrated THz detector-interferometer with optical cavity and antenna, exhibiting high sensitivity to the phase of incident THz light. We exploit this by determining the thickness of thin films placed in front of the detector-interferometer, obtaining a strongly sub-wavelength thickness accuracy of $\\sim$5 $\\mu$m, while we predict that an accuracy of 10 nm is within reach. This is relevant for a range of industrial application domains, including automotive, construction, and health. The detector-interferometer moreover exhibits a record-high external responsivity - without any normalization to a diffraction-limited spot size - of 73 mA/W and a noise-equivalent power of 79 pW$~\\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. This performance is due to enhanced absorption at the cavity mode around 89 GHz, in agreement with multi-physics simulations. These results pave the way to exploiting coherent wave detection in the THz regime with utility in spectroscopy, next-generation wireless communication, and beyond."

The spin orientation of the holmium adatom is stabilized by the strong uniaxial anisotropy of the adsorption site and can be read out by measuring the exchange forces between the magnetic tip and the atom. The spin orientation can be written by approaching the tip closer to the holmium adatom.We explain this writing mechanism by the symmetry reduction of the adsorption site of the Ho adatom. These findings demonstrate the potential for information storage with minimal energy loss and pave the way for a new field of atomic-scale mechano-spintronics."

We find that the non-reciprocity in the tunneling leads to the formation of an asymmetric density cone during the time-evolution of the system; the degree of asymmetry can be tuned by tuning the non-reciprocity parameter, $\\delta$. Next, we analyze the dynamics of this system in the presence of a static external force and demonstrate that non-Hermiticity leads to asymmetric two-particle Bloch oscillations. Interestingly, when $F=0$ ($F \\ne 0$), strong interactions leads to the formation of an inner density-cone (density-hourglass) structure; this inner structure also becomes asymmetric in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We further analyze the spatial correlations and establish that the system exhibits non-reciprocal bunching (anti-bunching) in the presence of weak (strong) interactions. Finally, we examine the growth of the Quantum Fisher Information, $F_Q$, with time, and demonstrate that $F_Q \\propto t^{\\alpha}$ where $\\alpha \\sim 3$. This feature persists for both one- and two-particle walks, thereby demonstrating that this system can be employed as a quantum-enhanced sensor for detecting weak forces."

      "summary": "Biological membranes often exhibit heterogeneous protein patterns, which cells control. Strong patterns, like the polarity spot in budding yeast, can be described as surface condensates, formed by physical interactions between constituents. However, it is unclear how these interactions affect the material exchange with the bulk. To study this, we analyze a thermodynamically consistent model, which reveals that passive exchange generally accelerates the coarsening of surface condensates. Active exchange can further accelerate coarsening, although it can also fully arrest it and induce complex patterns involving various length scales. We reveal how these behaviors are related to non-local transport via diffusion through the bulk, rationalizing the various scaling laws we observe and allowing us to interpret biologically relevant scenarios."

An energy of the Leggett plasmon has been estimated: $E_0$ ~ 4 meV. Distinct two-gap structures have been found in the CVCs of $MgB_2$ tunneling contacts and $MgB_2$ Andreev point contacts with 7.5 meV $< \\Delta_L <$ 11 meV and 1.5 meV $< \\Delta_S <$ 2.5 meV. An intrinsic tunneling effect (ITE) and intrinsic multiple Andreev reflections effect (IMARE) have been observed due to the layered structure of $MgB_2$.

      "summary": "Automated detection of grain boundaries (GBs) in electron microscope images of polycrystalline materials could help accelerate the nanoscale characterization of myriad engineering materials and novel materials under scientific research. Accurate segmentation of interconnected line networks, such as GBs in polycrystalline material microstructures, poses a significant challenge due to the fragmented masks produced by conventional computer vision (CV) algorithms, including convolutional neural networks. These algorithms struggle with thin masks, often necessitating post-processing for effective contour closure and continuity. Previous approaches in this domain have typically relied on custom post-processing techniques that are problem-specific and heavily dependent on the quality of the mask obtained from a CV algorithm. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a fast, high-fidelity post-processing technique that is universally applicable to segmentation masks of interconnected line networks. Leveraging domain knowledge about grain boundary connectivity, this method employs conditional random fields and perceptual grouping rules to refine segmentation masks of any image with a discernible grain structure. This approach significantly enhances segmentation mask accuracy by correctly reconstructing fragmented GBs in electron microscopy images of a polycrystalline oxide. The refinement improves the statistical representation of the microstructure, reflected by a 51 % improvement in a grain alignment metric that provides a more physically meaningful assessment of complex microstructures than conventional metrics. This method enables rapid and accurate characterization, facilitating an unprecedented level of data analysis and improving the understanding of GB networks, making it suitable for a range of disciplines where precise segmentation of interconnected line networks is essential."

Although other transport properties including electrical conductivity and thermoelectric conversion coefficients have material-specific values, it is known that thermal conductivity can be modulated artificially via phonon engineering techniques. Here, we demonstrate another way of artificially modulating the heat conduction in solids: magnonic thermal transport engineering. The time-domain thermoreflectance measurements using ferromagnetic metal/insulator junction systems reveal that the thermal conductivity of the ferromagnetic metals and interfacial thermal conductance vary significantly depending on the spatial distribution of nonequilibrium spin currents. Systematic measurements of the thermal transport properties with changing the boundary conditions for spin currents show that the observed thermal transport modulation stems from magnon origin. This observation unveils that magnons significantly contribute to the heat conduction even in ferromagnetic metals at room temperature, upsetting the conventional wisdom that the thermal conductivity mediated by magnons is very small in metals except at low temperatures. The magnonic thermal transport engineering offers a new principle and method for active thermal management."

      "summary": "Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases."

      "summary": "Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for energy balance, local temperature variations, and the ensuing stochastic effects. By modelling active matter as a driven open system, we show that the source of active contributions to hydrodynamics, violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and detailed balance is rooted in the breaking of time-translation symmetry due to the presence of fuel consumption and an external environmental bath. In addition, our framework allows for non-equilibrium steady states that produce entropy, with a well-defined notion of steady-state temperature. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions. We also show how to incorporate temperature, energy and noise in fluctuating hydrodynamics for active matter. Our work suggests a broader perspective on active matter that can leave an imprint across scales."

      "summary": "Fluid flow has a major effect on the aggregation and fragmentation of bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures in cyanobacteria, using an experimental technique that precisely controls hydrodynamic conditions. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels (exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and also offer potential applications in other areas such as algal biotechnology or medical settings where the dynamics of biological aggregates play a significant role."

The spiral spin texture naturally enlarges the unit cell, reducing carrier densities while preserving sizable interaction scales. Many-body calculations show that fractional fillings can support fractional Chern insulator and charge-density wave states. Remarkably, the mechanism is generic to a broad family of Re-based compounds, with both spin configuration and flat band topology tunable by electrical manipulation. Our findings establish Re-based coplanar antiferromagnets as a robust, tunable, and experimentally accessible platform for flat Chern bands and correlated topological phases potentially at elevated temperatures."

To date, the predominant experimental evidence centers around unconventional charge order, nematicity, and superconductivity, while magnetic fluctuations due to electronic interactions, i.e., beyond local atomic magnetism, have largely been elusive. We find the challenge of locating the appropriate parameter regime for such exotic order to center around two aspects. First, the correlations implied by low-energy orbitals have to be sufficiently large to yield a dominance of magnetic fluctuations and weak to retain an itinerant parent state. Second, the kinematic kagome profile at the Fermi level demands an efficient mitigation of sublattice interference causing the suppression of magnetic fluctuations descending from electronic on-site repulsion. We elucidate our methodology by analyzing the potential copper-based kagome compound CsCu$_3$Cl$_5$: From ab initio design and many-body analysis, we develop a model framework of realistic Cu-based kagome materials the simulations of which reveal unconventional magnetic order in a kagome metal."

      "summary": "The pursuit of a lattice analogue for Landau levels has been a central theme in condensed matter physics. Although the correspondence between Chern bands and the lowest Landau level has been widely studied, a lattice realization of the first Landau level remains elusive. Here we construct a minimal lattice model that provides a concrete orbital description of both the lowest and first Landau levels. Using maximally localized Wannier functions with $s$, $p_-$, and $p_+$ orbital character, we develop a three-orbital model in which the two lowest Chern bands are flat and each carries a Chern number $\\mathcal{C}=1$. The band topology arises from a sequence of ideal band inversions between Wannier states at the $\\Gamma$ and $K$ points in momentum space, establishing an adiabatic connection between the atomic insulator limit and Landau level physics. Notably, many-body exact diagonalization reveals that the non-Abelian state can appear in the half-filled first Chern band. This construction can be further generalized to realize flat Chern bands analogous to higher Landau levels. Our results provide a new perspective on lattice analogues of Landau levels and may enable the exploration of fascinating topological phenomena at elevated temperatures."

      "summary": "Living organisms have developed advanced motion strategies for efficient space exploration, serving as inspiration for the movements of microrobots. These real-life strategies often involve anomalous dynamics displaying random movement patterns that deviate from Brownian motion. Despite their biological inspiration, autonomous stochastic navigation strategies of current microrobots remain much less versatile than those of their living counterparts. Supported by theoretical reasoning, this work demonstrates superparamagnetic colloidal microrobots with fully customizable stochastic dynamics displaying the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, across statistically significant spatial and temporal scales (covering at least two decades). By simultaneously tuning microrobots' step-length distribution and, critically, their velocity autocorrelation function with magnetic fields, fundamental anomalous dynamics are reproduced with tailored properties mimicking L\\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion. These findings pave the way for programmable microrobotic systems that replicate optimal stochastic navigation strategies found in nature for applications in medical robotics and environmental remediation."

      "summary": "Atomic resolution imaging is key to understanding thin film growth and how a particular set of conditions influences properties. Whilst such imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has had transformative impact in nanoscience, it forms projection images and provides no direct information about displacements perpendicular to the image plane. In this article we show that it is possible to make atomic resolution maps of the direction and magnitude of La displacements at ~30{\\deg} to the imaging plane in a La2CoMnO6 thin film on (111) LSAT (LaAlO3-La(Sr,Ta)O3) using a 4-dimensional STEM (4DSTEM) methodology. This reveals that the La modulation lies preferentially in the interface plane, and is strongly suppressed close to the epitaxial interface, and further reveals how the modulation varies with distance from the interface with unit cell resolution. These details would be completely invisible to all prior techniques in electron microscopy and this sheds light on why this particular substrate in this orientation best promotes double perovskite cation ordering, and the consequent optimal magnetic ordering for this thin film system. The approach used herein of fitting atomic resolution 4DSTEM data to determine crystal parameters opens the door for a new era of atomic-resolution crystallography."

Analytical expressions for quasi-energy bands are derived for aligned stacking, while numerical results address cyclic stacking at Dirac points. Circularly polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracies at the intersections $t^{a,c}$, leading to the appearance of a Haldane-type Chern insulator in the absence of a magnetic field . At $\\alpha = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, orbital magnetic moments of corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, as do their Berry curvatures. For $0 < \\alpha < 1$, light-induced band deformations near Dirac points create gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum, where the chemical potential modulates orbital magnetization. Linear magnetization variations align with Chern numbers, yielding quantized anomalous Hall conductivity across stacking types. Notable particle-hole symmetry breaking within $0 < \\alpha < 1$ suggests applications in valley caloritronics and quantum sensing. At $\\alpha = 1$, flat and corrugated bands remain undistorted; while the flat band contributes no Berry curvature, it produces a finite negative orbital magnetic moment, contrasting with the positive moment of the corrugated band."

      "summary": "The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Traditional stress-strain methods have made it possible to compute elastic constants for ordered structures and individually tailored alloy compositions. However, this approach depends on predetermined or iteratively-chosen strain tensors. This poses a significant challenge for systematic, composition-dependent studies of disordered materials with low symmetry. DFPT provides a compelling alternative to stress-strain methods: it allows for an unbiased determination of the elastic tensor, as well as access to local field data derived from the underlying general response function framework. Despite its intrinsic flexibility and efficiency, DFPT has seen limited application to the study of disordered systems. At the same time, there is a growing need for expanded quantum mechanical data to improve predictive modeling of complex disordered material properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory BCC binary alloys of Mo, Nb, Ta, and W. We map the quantum-driven heterogeneity in elastic properties, and associated relaxation fields at each disordered structure lattice site, by computing the force response internal strain tensor and displacement response internal strain tensors. Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The DFPT-computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data."

We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\\omega_{D+1},\\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models."

In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars."

      "summary": "In theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prevents continuous symmetry breaking at any finite temperature, thus forbidding a Landau phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$. The difficulty arises when many-body theoretical studies predict a Landau phase transition at finite temperatures, which contradicts the Mermin-Wagner theorem and is termed a pseudo phase transition. To tackle this problem, we systematically develop a symmetrization scheme, defined as averaging physical quantities over all symmetry-breaking states, thus ensuring that it preserves the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We apply the symmetrization scheme to the GW-covariance calculation for the 2D repulsive Hubbard model at half-filling in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime and at low temperatures, obtaining the one-body Green's function and spin-spin correlation function, and benchmark them against Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) with good agreement.The spin-spin correlation functions are approached within the covariance theory, a general method for calculating two-body correlation functions from a one-particle starting point, such as the GW formalism used here, which ensures the preservation of the fundamental fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) and Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI). With the FDR and WTI satisfied, we conjecture that the $\\chi$-sum rule, a fundamental relation from the Pauli exclusion principle, can be used to probe the reliability of many-body methods, and demonstrate this by comparing the GW-covariance and mean-field-covariance approaches. This work provides a novel framework to investigate the strong-coupling and doped regime of the 2D Hubbard model, which is believed to be applicable to real high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors."

This images the shifts of diffraction spots and the azimuthal intensity distribution in the First Order Laue Zone, and then uses them to reconstruct and map the 3D crystallography. This clearly shows a flip from out-of-plane modulation with tensile strain on SrTiO3 to in-plane modulation with compressive strain on LSAT. This hitherto unobserved crystallographic change had a significant influence on the out-of-plane lattice parameter which left more room for the full incorporation of the larger CoO6 octahedra in the film grown on LSAT and therefore explained the improved Mn-Co ordering and better properties for this film. Moreover, the method would be applicable to many other systems of epitaxial growth of complex oxides, revealing crystallographic details of crucial importance to properties which are not visible in conventional atomic resolution imaging."

Among the key challenges, the design of superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries often faces a fundamental trade-off between stability and ionic conductivity. Random substitutional crystals, where atomic species are randomly distributed throughout a crystal lattice, present a promising route to overcome this trade-off. Although the importance of cooperative motion in ion conduction has been pointed out, there is a lack of understanding of the relationship between mesoscale structural organization and macroscopic conductivity, limiting the rational design of optimal compositions. Here, we systematically investigate the ionic conductivity of rock salt random substitutional ionic crystals Li$_x$Pb$_{1-2x}$Bi$_x$Te as a function of Li concentration $x$ using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that ionic conductivity increases sharply once the $x$ exceeds a critical threshold, without disrupting the underlying crystal structure. Strikingly, this threshold aligns with the site-percolation threshold predicted by percolation theory. Our findings establish ion percolation as a universal design principle that reconciles the trade-off between conductivity and stability, offering a simple and broadly applicable strategy for the development of robust, high-performance solid electrolytes."

This model captures various phases of bulk CTO and successfully reproduces, in particular, the structure, energy, and dynamical properties of the nonpolar $Pbnm$ ground state as well as of the hidden ferroelectric $R3c$ phase. Finite-temperature simulations suggest that the still debated sequence of structural phase transitions over heating is $Pbnm \\ (a^-a^-c^+) \\rightarrow C2/m \\ (a^-b^-c^0) \\rightarrow I4/mcm \\ (a^-c^0c^0) \\rightarrow Pm\\bar{3}m \\ (a^0a^0a^0)$, a sequence during which the oxygen-octahedra rotations around the three pseudocubic axes vanish successively. Although never experimentally observed in bulk, the ferroelectric $R3c$ phase appears to be metastable and at an energy only slightly above the $Pbnm$ ground state at zero Kelvin. The simulations confirm that, if induced in some way, the $R3c$ phase remains stable up to about 300 K and shows ferroelectric properties. Furthermore, we find that the minimum energy path connecting the $Pbnm$ and $R3c$ phases involves localized layer-by-layer flipping of octahedral rotations, a mechanism which is shown to be at play during the thermal destabilization process of the $R3c$ phase toward the $Pbnm$ ground state. The proximity of the $R3c$ phase with the $Pbnm$ ground state suggests that the former could be stabilized under electric field. However, due to the large energy barrier, the field required for the $Pbnm$-to-$R3c$ transition appears to be extremely large, consistent with the fact that bulk CTO was never reported to be ferroelectric nor antiferroelectric."

Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation. Our results provide insights for the design and control of structural and dynamical properties of active odd elastic materials."

      "summary": "Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze the amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect."

      "summary": "We study the deformation and slip-through of a heavy elastic beam suspended above two point supports and subject to an increasing body force -- an idealized model of a fibre trapped in the pores of a filter as flow strength increases, for example. Using both asymptotic and numerical techniques, we investigate the behaviour of the beam under increasing body force and the maximum force that can be supported before it must slip between the supports. We quantify this maximum body force as a function of the separation between the two supports. Surprisingly, we show the existence of a critical separation below which the beam can withstand an arbitrarily large body force, even in the absence of friction. This is understood as the limit of a catenary between the supports that is connected to (and supported by the tension in) a vertically hanging portion outside the supports. We explore how frictional forces impact the deformation and load-bearing capacity of the beam and show that our results are consistent with laboratory experiments."

Traditional spin-lattice dynamics (SLD), employing Newtonian equation for lattice evolution and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for spin, encounters severe limitations with machine-learning potentials (MLPs), including poor energy conservation and excessive computational costs due to non-symplectic integration. In this work, we propose TSPIN, a unified Nos\\'e-Hoover chain (NHC) framework that augments the spin-lattice Lagrangian with spin kinetic terms and thermostat/barostat variables, yielding a symplectic Hamiltonian formulation for NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles. The method integrates spin and lattice dynamics simultaneously, ensuring energy conservation and reducing computational cost. Benchmarks on harmonic models confirm its accuracy, while Fe simulations with the DeepSPIN potential demonstrate superior stability, efficiency, and the ability to capture magnetic phase transition. TSPIN thus provides a general and efficient framework for large-scale simulations of spin-lattice phenomena and multiple-DOF systems."

      "summary": "Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, but the kinetic pathway of anisotropic particle systems remains elusive, where the coupling between translational and rotational motions plays a critical role in various kinetic processes. Here we investigate this problem by molecular dynamics simulation for two-dimensional ball-stick polygon systems, where pentagon, hexagon, and octagon systems all undergo an isostructural solid-solid phase transition. During heating, the translational motion exhibits merely a homogeneous expansion, whereas the time evolution of body-orientation is shape-determined. The local defects of body-orientation self-organize into a vague stripe for pentagon, a random pattern for hexagon, while a distinct stripe for octagon. The underlying kinetic pathway of octagon adheres to the quasi-equilibrium assumption, whereas the pathways of hexagon and pentagon are governed by translational and rotational motion, respectively. This diversity is originated from different kinetic coupling modes determined by the anisotropy of molecules, and can affect the phase transition rates. The reverse process in terms of cooling follows the same mechanism, with more diverse kinetic pathways attributed to the possible kinetic traps. Our findings promote the theoretical understanding of microscopic kinetics of solid-solid phase transitions as well as provide direct guidance for the rational design of materials utilizing desired kinetic features."

In this short note, we consider extensions of simple disordered kinetic glass models from statistical physics. These models have tunable correlations, are easy to sample, and can be solved exactly when the state space dimension is large. In particular, we give an expository derivation of the dynamical mean field theories that describe their asymptotic statistics. We therefore propose that they constitute an interesting set of toy models for autoregressive sequence generation, in which one might study learning dynamics."

It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method."

Here, the electronic structure and magnetic properties have been studied using first-principles calculations for the LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$, and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$ compounds sharing the kagome Fe$_3$Ge layer motif but with different interlayer arrangements. For LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$ and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$, the predicted magnetic ground states are collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) states involving a mix of ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM interlayer orientations. Whereas for LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, an incommensurate cycloidal spin spiral is stabilized as a ground state, being close to a collinear A-type AFM state. The analysis of magnetic RKKY exchange coupling confirms the results of electronic structure calculations. The values of atomic magnetic moments are in good agreement with existing experimental estimations. Our experiments on LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$ single crystals have observed AFM ordering at ~540 K and transition to another magnetic phase, with a small FM component (possibly with spin canting), below ~270 K. Thus, our theory and experiment suggest the existence and sequence of collinear and noncollinear magnetic states in kagome LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$. Our findings provide a platform for exploring various novel magnetic phases and associated unconventional or topological magnetism."

Here, we demonstrate device-level thermal management tailored for two vertical \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications."

      "summary": "In a previous work, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a network of investors and firms. In that framework, financial agents could invest in firms or in other investors, and banks-introduced as investors with a credit multiplier-could play a stabilizing or destabilizing role. Collective states emerged from these interactions, reflecting different configurations of capital distribution and stability in the financial system. However, these results relied on the assumption that financial connections were exogenous. The present paper removes this assumption by modeling financial connections as dynamic endogenous variables. Specifically, we extend the framework by introducing a field representation of the network of financial connections. The collective states previously identified are now embedded in a broader class of states, characterized by the structure of investment stakes among investors. We show that these collective states consist of inter-connected groups of agents, along with their returns and disposable capital. The model reveals the emergence of two investor classes: high- and low-return (and capital) agents. High-return investors, in particular, act as a source of instability within the system, enabling transitions between configurations. In each collective state, some sectors may experience defaults. When the collective state exhibits specific structural conditions, defaults may spread across a significant share of the group."

In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \\( J_z \\) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \\( J_z \\) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength.

Romeo et al. [Adv. Mater. 2010, 22, 3441-3445] had previously shown that dense aqueous PNIPAM suspensions transformed from one viscoelastic solid-like phase to another when suspension temperature was increased, with an intermediate viscoelastic liquid-like phase near the VPTT. They attributed this observation to a change in the inter-particle interaction from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Here, we show using a combination of experimental techniques that particle hydrophobicity can become significant even below the VPTT. We achieve this by incorporating dissociating additives such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, or non-dissociating additives such as sucrose, into the aqueous medium. Above the VPTT, we observe that suspension rigidity is the highest in the presence of salts because of the combined effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic attractions. In the presence of non-dissociating sucrose, in contrast, the inter-microgel interaction remains hydrophobic across the VPTT. Such easy tunability of interactions by incorporating commonly available chemicals into the suspension medium opens up new avenues for the synthesis of novel metamaterials."

The long-term memory is based on magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of standard electronics.

Since then, interest in the field has increased significantly, as a photon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) represents a prototypical driven-dissipative system. Here, we investigate how its inherent open nature influences the condensation process both quantitatively and qualitatively. To this end, we consider a mean-field model, which can be derived microscopically from a Lindblad master equation. The underlying rate equations depend on various external parameters such as emission and absorption rates of the dye molecules as well as the cavity photon loss rate. In steady state, we obtain an open-dissipative Bose-Einstein distribution for the mode occupations. The chemical potential of this distribution depends on the occupations of the dye molecules in both their ground and excited state and must therefore be determined self-consistently. We find that the resulting photon distribution is strongly influenced by the driven-dissipative parameters. Based on this result, we identify the main differences between a photonic BEC, an atomic BEC, and a laser."

      "summary": "The jamming transition is traditionally regarded as a geometric transition governed by static contact networks. Recently, dynamic phase transitions of athermal particles under periodic shear provide a new lens on this problem, leading to a conjecture that jamming transition corresponds to an absorbing-state transition within the Manna (conserved directed percolation) universality class. Here, by re-examining the biased random organization model, a minimal model for particles under periodic shearing that the conjecture is based on, we uncover several criticality anomalies at high density at odds with Manna universality class. In three-dimensional monodisperse systems, we find crystallization disrupts the absorbing transition, while in dense binary mixtures, a distinct transition from absorbing to active-glass states emerges, signifying a new universality class of dynamic phase transition. Closer to the jamming point, the quenched heterogeneity in the contact network smears the dynamic transition via Griffiths effects and drives the system toward heterogeneous directed percolation. We propose a field theory with fractional time dynamics that unifies these phenomena, establishing a theoretical framework linking jamming, disorder, and dynamic criticality."

      "summary": "While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models."

The results show the susceptibility onset temperature tracks the critical temperature ($T_c$) of HTSCs with a comparable scale across the electron filling factor. Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\\mathbf{q}=(\\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly. It suggests that the emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations. In this context, the pseudogap partially suppresses antinodal spectral weight near $\\omega = 0$, thereby reducing the low-$\\omega$ particle-hole phase space."

      "summary": "Multiferroics are materials with coexisting electric and magnetic orders that are of central importance for fundamental research and technological applications. Unfortunately, intrinsic multiferroics that operate at room temperature remain rare due to an apparent incompatibility between magnetism and ferroelectricity. Here we predict that a pure ferroelectric support multiferroic-like quasiparticles, termed ``multiferrons\", that simultaneously carry \\emph{static} magnetic and electric dipoles. The electric dipole moment emerges from the parity-odd anharmonicity of the ferroelectric dynamics, while the magnetic moment has both paramagnetic and diamagnetic origins generated by circularly polarized transverse fluctuations of the ferroelectric polarization. In contrast to the established ``dynamical multiferroicity\" of circularly polarized phonons, which involve only \\emph{oscillating} electric dipoles, multiferrons cause, apart from Zeeman and Einstein-de Haas effects, a linear dc Stark response, giant electric-field-tunable second-harmonic generation in the THz-frequency regime, and a finite magnetoelectric cross coupling. Multiferrons open a new route toward nonlinear THz optical applications and offer multiferroic functionalities with simple ferroelectrics."

      "summary": "Dislocations in ceramics have recently gained renewed research interest, in contrast to the traditional belief that ceramics are inherently brittle. Understanding dislocation mechanics in representative oxides is beneficial for effective dislocation engineering. Here, we use MgO single crystals with mechanically seeded dislocation densities from about 10 to the power of 12 to about 10 to the power of 15 per square meter to investigate the mechanical behavior such as yield and fracture. Micro-pillar compression tests reveal a dislocation density dependent yield strength, mediated by the varying dominating dislocation mechanisms from nucleation to multiplication/motion. In situ TEM compression measurements highlight the dislocation-seeded samples can achieve a much-improved compressive plastic strain beyond about 70%, with a high yield strength of about 2.35 GPa (diameter of about 400 nm), indicating size effect. Complementary bulk compression tests, along with digital image correlation (DIC), demonstrate a consistent dislocation-mediated deformation and a notable size effect, with bulk samples exhibiting much reduced yield strength (about 120 MPa) compared to the nano-/micro-pillars. Using three-dimensional Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (3D-DDD) simulation, we further qualitatively analyze the collective dislocation activities (slip events) and work hardening during compression. This study provides new insights into dislocation-mediated plasticity in MgO, across different length scales, by systematically tuning dislocation density."

      "summary": "Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from inflammation to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. Cell interactions are encoded in a dual signaling graph capable of handling signaling cascades. The dual graph architecture of our neural networks reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed for training, compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts."

Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors."

      "summary": "Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals. This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential, pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$, $J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S>J_D$) or a valley doublet ($J_D>J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D>J_S,J_D>0$, the valley doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when $J_S>J_D,J_S>0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet (local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG calculations."

      "summary": "Recent laboratory experiments suggest an intrinsic asymmetry between heating and cooling, with heating occurring more efficiently. Two decades earlier, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations had examined a related setup - heating one side of a computational cell while cooling the other via distinct thermostats. We revisit those calculations, recapitulating the underlying theory and showing that earlier MD results already hinted at the observed laboratory asymmetry. Recent realizations of a simple two-dimensional single-particle model, thermostatted in $x$ and $y$ at different temperatures, reproduces key features: at equilibrium, thermostat variables were identical, but under nonequilibrium conditions, the heating variable is weaker than the cooling one. At the same time, MD simulations from four decades ago by Evans and Holian reported a surprising skew in the Nose--Hoover thermostat variable $\\xi$ under equilibrium - indicating a statistical bias in energy injection versus extraction. We revisit those results with exact reproduction of their setup. We show that when (1) the center-of-mass velocity is set to zero, (2) integration is done carefully with finite differencing, and (3) sampling is sufficiently long, the distribution of $\\xi$ is symmetric and Gaussian with zero mean, as predicted by theory and validated by two independent error estimates. However, in the two-temperature cell, the distribution of thermostat variables become asymmetric, the cold bath requires significantly stronger damping than the hot bath requires anti-damping, with $\\langle \\xi_x \\rangle / \\langle \\xi_y \\rangle = -T_y/T_x$. This exact analytic relation links thermostat effort to thermal bias and the negative rate of change in the entropy of the system. These results identify the microscopic origin of heating-cooling asymmetry as a genuine nonequilibrium effect, consistent with experimental findings."

Terahertz spintronic magnetometry resolves reversible switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization states and correlates the high- and low-emission regimes with constructive and destructive interference of charge transients generated by the inverse spin Hall effect in the Pt spacer. A residual low-emission signal is traced to spin-to-charge conversion in IrMn. Phase inversion under front- versus back-side excitation confirms the ISHE origin, while a macrospin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model reproduces the field dependence and separates layer-specific contributions.

Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta."

Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic FeCl$_2$ monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials."

      "summary": "Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: In machine learning, there is a long history of trying to build neural networks that can learn from fewer example data by baking in strong geometric priors. However, it is not always clear a priori what geometric constraints are appropriate for a given task. Here, we explore the possibility that one can uncover useful geometric inductive biases by studying how training molds the Riemannian geometry induced by unconstrained neural network feature maps. We first show that at infinite width, neural networks with random parameters induce highly symmetric metrics on input space. This symmetry is broken by feature learning: networks trained to perform classification tasks learn to magnify local areas along decision boundaries. This holds in deep networks trained on high-dimensional image classification tasks, and even in self-supervised representation learning. These results begin to elucidate how training shapes the geometry induced by unconstrained neural network feature maps, laying the groundwork for an understanding of this richly nonlinear form of feature learning."

This invites us to think beyond the traditional 2-qubit-gate framework and consider a naturally supported ``instruction set'' of multi-qubit gates. In this work, we systematically study such a family of multi-qubit gates implementable over an array of quantum dots by DC evolution. A useful representation of the computational Hamiltonian is proposed for a dot-array with strong spin-orbit coupling effects, distinctive $g$-factor tensors and varying interdot couplings. Adopting a perturbative treatment, we model a multi-qubit DC gate by the first-order dynamics in the qubit frame and develop a detailed formalism for decomposing the resulting gate, estimating and optimizing the coherent gate errors with appropriate local phase shifts for arbitrary array connectivity. Examples of such multi-qubit gates and their applications in quantum error correction and quantum algorithms are also explored, demonstrating their potential advantage in accelerating complex tasks and reducing overall errors."

However, experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in media. In the process, we expose some of the short-comings in earlier analyses that have kept the paradox alive."

An optically trapped spherical birefringent particle phagosome provides an ideal platform to probe fluidity of the shell, as the inner particle is optically confined both in translation and in rotation. Using a recently reported method to calibrate the translation and pitch rotations - yielding a spatial resolution of about 2 nm and angular resolution of 0.1 degrees - we report novel roto-translational coupled dynamics. We also suggest a new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and pitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent particle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the activity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell. Applying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show that this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a signature of broken detailed balance."

As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \\geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distributions. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature fails to accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically more accurate at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, we show that analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the state is highly valuable when investigating more general SA architectures without necessarily admitting an energy function. It reveals that the normalization layer plays an essential role in suppressing the Lipschitzness of SA and the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, which correspond to the oscillatory components of the dynamics. In addition, the Lyapunov exponents computed from the Jacobians demonstrate that the normalized dynamics lie close to a critical state, and this criticality serves as a strong indicator of high inference performance. Furthermore, the Jacobian perspective also enables us to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics."

In this work, we demonstrate that \\emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising and $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg models show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with state of the art methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms."

In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values."

In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain."

Yet tools to identify such structures remain limited. We develop a gradient-based optimization framework to identify synchrony-optimal weighted networks under a constrained coupling budget. The resulting networks exhibit counterintuitive features: they are sparse, bipartite, elongated, and extremely monophilic (i.e., the neighbors of any node are similar to one another while differing from the node itself). These findings are matched by \"constructive\" theory: a nonlinear differential equation identifies which pairs of nodes are coupled, while a variational principle prescribes the budget allocated to each node. Dynamics unfolding over optimal networks provably lack a synchronization threshold; instead, as the budget exceeds a calculable critical value, the system globally phase-locks, exhibiting critical scaling at the transition. Our results have implications for power grids, neuromorphic computing, and other coupled oscillator technologies."

The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020)."

The high-temperature structure contains linear La-Pb chains, and the CDW is associated with the formation of La-Pb pairs within these chains. The presence of a low-temperature CDW transition is suggested by anomalously large thermal ellipses associated with the La atoms in the chains, potentially offering a means of searching for potential CDW compounds.

      "summary": "Ising machines realized on field-programmable gate arrays are used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Performance is limited by the speed of the digital clocked arithmetic that is part of the algorithm, so in this study the authors simplify the Ising machine by replacing all arithmetic with a set of look-up tables, while retaining the polynomial scaling of chip resources with problem size. The result is reduction of both resource usage and time to solution by more than an order of magnitude, compared to previous approaches. Future implementations of Ising machines may be inspired by this simplified design. [Phys. Rev. Applied 24, 054009] Published Tue Nov 04, 2025"
