Increasing environmental impact concerns and regulatory pressures drive the search for alternatives with comparable or superior performance. We present an AI-driven polymer design pipeline employing virtual forward synthesis (VFS) to generate PET-replacement copolymers. Inspired by the esterification route of PET synthesis, we systematically combined a down-selected set of Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)-listed monomers to create 12,100 PET-like polymers. Machine learning models predicted glass transition temperature (Tg), band gap, and tendency to crystallize, for all designs. Multi-objective screening identified 1,108 candidates predicted to match or exceed PET in $T_{\\rm g}$ and band gap, including the ``rediscovery'' of other known commercial PET-alternate polymers (e.g., PETG, Tritan, Ecozen) that provide retrospective validation of our design pipeline, demonstrating a capability to rapidly design experimentally feasible polymers at a scale. Furthermore, selected, entirely new (previously unknown) candidates designed here have been synthesized and characterized, providing a definitive validation of the design framework."

      "summary": "In this study, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, the water flow in carbon nanocones is studied using the TIP4P/2005 rigid water model. The results demonstrate a nonuniform dependence of the flow on the cone apex angle and the diameter of the opening where the flow is established, leading to a significant increase in the flow in some cases. The effects of cone diameter and pressure gradient are investigated to explain flow behavior with different system structures. We observed that some cones can optimize the water flow precisely. Nanocones with a larger opening facilitate the sliding of water, significantly increasing the flow, thus being promising membranes for technological use in water impurity separation processes. Nanocones with narrower opening angles limited water mobility due to excessive confinement. This phenomenon is linked to the ability of water to form a larger hydrogen-bond network in typical systems with diameters of this size, obtaining a single-layer water structure. Nanocones act as selective nanofilters capable of allowing water molecules to pass through while blocking salts and impurities. The conical shape of their structures creates a directed flow that improves separation efficiency. Membranes based on carbon nanocones are becoming promising for clean, smart, and efficient technologies. The combination of transport speed, selectivity, and structural control put them ahead of other nanostructures for various purposes."

      "summary": "Polymer packaging plays a crucial role in food preservation but poses major challenges in recycling and environmental persistence. To address the need for sustainable, high-performance alternatives, we employed a polymer informatics workflow to identify single- and multi-layer drop-in replacements for polymer-based packaging materials. Machine learning (ML) models, trained on carefully curated polymer datasets, predicted eight key properties across a library of approximately 7.4 million ring-opening polymerization (ROP) polymers generated by virtual forward synthesis (VFS). Candidates were prioritized by the enthalpy of polymerization, a critical metric for chemical recyclability. This screening yielded thousands of promising candidates, demonstrating the feasibility of replacing diverse packaging architectures. We then experimentally validated poly(p-dioxanone) (poly-PDO), an existing ROP polymer whose barrier performance had not been previously reported. Validation showed that poly-PDO exhibits strong water barrier performance, mechanical and thermal properties consistent with predictions, and excellent chemical recyclability (95% monomer recovery), thereby meeting the design targets and underscoring its potential for sustainable packaging. These findings highlight the power of informatics-driven approaches to accelerate the discovery of sustainable polymers by uncovering opportunities in both existing and novel chemistries."

Depending on the system and forcing parameters, liquid-vapor and liquid-solid co-existing states are possible. For the solid-liquid coexistence that is observed in quasi-two-dimensional vibrated systems, both first- and second-order transitions have been reported. Experiments show that particles in the solid cluster move collectively, synchronized with the cell's vibration, in a similar way to the collect-and-collide regime observed in granular dampers. Here, we present a model that proposes a microscopic origin of this granular phase transition and co-existence. Imposing synchronicity, we model the solid cluster as an effective particle of zero restitution coefficient. In addition, we use the mechanical equilibrium between the two phases, with an equation of state validated for hard spheres relating the horizontal velocities in each phase. Balancing energy input and dissipation per unit time we obtain a global power equation, which relates the characteristic vertical and horizontal velocities to the microscopic relevant parameters (geometric and dissipation coefficients) as well as to the vibration amplitude and solid cluster's size. The predictions of the model compare quite well with our experimental results and with the experimental and dynamic simulation results reported elsewhere."

Motivated by the recent experimental reports, we study an 11-band Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \\textit{ab initio} calculations of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, by using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory approaches. Our results demonstrate that the major antiferromagnetic superexchange couplings in thin-film La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ can be significantly weaker than in the bulk at 29.5 Gpa. The out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is significantly reduced by about 27% in film, whereas, the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unchanged. We estimate the antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\\parallel}$ and $J_{\\perp}$ by using perturbation theory. Regarding charge transfer, we find that biaxial compression in the thin films results in reduced charge-transfer gap compared to the bulk material. We determine the distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) orbitals and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals. A significant particle-hole asymmetry regarding carrier doping is revealed. Our results provide a foundation for subsequent studies of the low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, and ofer key insights into the understanding of physical differences between the film and bulk bilayer nickelate high-temperature superconductors."

      "summary": "We report the first observation of controlled, strain-induced square moire patterns in stacked graphene. By selectively displacing native wrinkles, we drive a reversible transition from the usual trigonal to square moire order. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals elliptically shaped AA domains, while spectroscopy shows strong electronic correlation in the form of narrow bands with split Van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. A continuum model with electrostatic interactions reproduces these features under the specific twist-strain combination that minimizes elastic energy. This work demonstrates that the combination of twist and strain, or twistraintronics, enables the realization of highly correlated electronic states in moire heterostructures with geometries that were previously inaccessible."

      "summary": "We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator. By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon."

      "summary": "Spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) are promising nanoscale microwave sources for spintronic applications, serving as signal generators or elements in neuromorphic computing systems. In this paper, we investigate the experimental realization of an oscillator based on a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) comprising two magnetic layers: a reference layer (RL) and a free layer (FL). We demonstrate that when magnetic vortices with opposite chirality and polarity are formed in the layers, the application of a current induces auto-oscillations even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect is observed in devices with diameters ranging from 800 to 1000 nm, exhibiting oscillation frequencies between 110 and 60 MHz. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the action of a spin current with vortex-like polarization injected from the RL, interacting with the magnetic vortex in the FL. This interaction generates a local out-of-plane effective field due to spin-transfer torque, which acts on the vortex core and initiates its motion. The observed mechanism differs qualitatively from the case of uniformly polarized spin currents perpendicular to the plane, where the resulting in-plane field acts on the planar components of the vortex magnetization."

      "summary": "The possibility of controlling spins using ultrashort light and strain pulses has triggered intense discussions about the mechanisms responsible for magnetic re-ordering. All-optical magnetisation switching can be achieved through ultrafast heat-driven demagnetisation or transient modifications of magnetic anisotropy. During the phononic switching of magnetic dielectrics, however, mid-infrared optical excitations can modify the crystal environment via both the thermal quenching of anisotropy and the generation of strain respectively, with the relative distinction between these thermal and non-thermal processes remaining an open question. Here, we examine the effect of mid-infrared pulses tuned to the frequency of optical phonon resonances on the labyrinthine domain structure of a cobalt-doped yttrium iron garnet film. We find that the labyrinthine domains are transformed into stable parallel stripes, and quantitative micromagnetic calculations demonstrate this stems predominantly from a partial quenching of the anisotropy. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, we find that this heat-facilitated process of magnetisation switching is spectrally strongest not at the maximum of absorbed optical energy but rather at the epsilon-near-zero points. Our results reveal that the epsilon-near-zero condition provides an alternative pathway for laser-driven control of magnetisation, even when the underlying mechanism is primarily thermal."

Our experimental results indicate that the magnetic ground state is neither a conventional three-dimensional (3D) long-range order (LRO) nor a pure gapless spin-liquid state, as conjectured previously [Boya et al., APL Mater. 10, 101103 (2022)]. Specifically, the observation of a nearly field-independent NMR linewidth below $T^{*}$ = (3.5 $\\pm$ 0.4) K, and a significant enhancement of spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ below $2T^{*}$ (where $T^{*}$ is the characteristic temperature identified from the magnetic susceptibility), indicate a complex magnetic ground state where spin freezing coexists with persistent dynamics. Furthermore, we argue that the lack of magnetic LRO and the persistence of strong magnetic fluctuations in KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ are unlikely to originate from intersite K/Sr disorder, rather arise due to intrinsic magnetic frustration. Our findings position KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ into a broader family of geometrically frustrated magnets characterized by coexisting spin freezing and pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, marking it as a promising platform for investigating exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets."

      "summary": "Ultra-low-crosslinked (ULC) microgels are among the softest colloidal particles nowadays routinely synthesized experimentally. Despite a growing literature of experimental results, their microscopic behavior under crowded conditions is yet to be revealed. To this aim, we resort to realistic monomer-resolved computer simulations to investigate their structural, mechanical, and dynamical properties across a wide range of packing fractions. Using particle-resolved analyses, we unveil the role of outer chains in the ULCs, which manifest in peculiar behaviors, utterly different from those of regularly crosslinked microgels. In particular, we report the absence of faceting and the dominance of interpenetration between microgels at high densities. Furthermore, we observe no signs of local ordering in the radial distribution functions, nor the structural reentrance characteristic of Hertzian-like particles. This is accompanied by the lack of a dynamical arrest transition, even well above random close packing. Altogether, our results establish ULCs as a distinct class of soft colloids in which polymeric degrees of freedom are highly predominant over colloidal ones, providing for the first time a robust, microscopic framework to interpret their unusual behavior."

      "summary": "Magnetic monopoles, long hypothesised as fundamental particles carrying isolated magnetic charge, emerge in spin-ice systems as fractionalised excitations governed by the ice rule. Yet their three-dimensional field structure has never been directly visualised. Here, we use two-photon lithography and processing to fabricate a fully three-dimensional artificial spin-ice lattice with diamond-bond geometry. We then use scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry to directly measure the stray magnetic fields of both charge-neutral and monopole vertices. We find that ice-rule vertices produce antivortex textures directly above their vertices, stabilised by the local frustrated two-in/two out ordering principle. Direct imaging of the monopole stray field shows a highly divergent profile. By correlating experiment with micromagnetic simulations and performing a multipole expansion of the reconstructed magnetisation, we reveal that monopoles in 3DASI are non-trivial micromagnetic entities, carrying both magnetic charge and an intrinsic moment, giving rise to anisotropic interactions that are dependent upon the quasiparticles position on the lattice. Results suggest that as monopoles separate under an applied field, the dipolar contribution to their interaction reorients relative to the underlying Coulombic field, revealing that monopole coupling is tunable through geometry, being set by the local vertex topology. These findings establish 3DASI as a programmable magnetic metamaterial in which nanoscale geometry governs the energetics and dynamics of emergent magnetic charges."

Temperature and gate dependent transport measurements, supported by a self consistent approximation model, reveal that electron hole puddles dominate charge transport in this regime, highlighting the essential role of impurity disorder in stabilizing quantized critical transport. These findings establish a tunable experimental framework that connects gap-closing physics with universal conductivity, offering both microscopic insight into critical transport in magnetic topological insulators and a robust platform for probing quantum criticality in topological systems."

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterize CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ as a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) compound with mixed-valent Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$ on a single crystallographic site. $^{57}$Fe M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy indicates that the Fe sublattice is nonmagnetic, in direct contrast with recent reports of this compound. Low-temperature electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements show no evidence of magnetic ordering, and a modest Sommerfeld coefficient ($\\gamma$) of 22.7 mJ/mol$\\cdot$K$^2$ make extensive Kondo hybridization unlikely. DC and AC magnetic susceptibility data suggest short-range magnetic order at $\\sim$5.2 and 7.6 K with no frequency dependence, ruling out canonical spin-glass behavior in this compound. Additionally, the magnetic susceptibility data does not contain any broad features that are typically associated with an intermediate valence state in Ce, suggesting either high-temperature valence fluctuation or a different mechanism of mixed valency. This work demonstrates that mixed-valent Ce inhibits magnetic ordering in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ and provides a broader picture for how to analyze short-range spin interactions in Q1D intermetallics."

Density-functional theory combined with machine-learning molecular dynamics show that intrinsic lattice mismatch between bonded component crystals imprints asymmetric prestrain states at crack tips, governing bond-breaking thresholds through charge redistribution. The failure criterion obeys a universal exponential scaling law between normalized charge density and bond strain, insensitive to bonding chemistry and local atomic environment. The magnitude of nonreciprocity scales systematically with lattice mismatch, reaching 49% at 10% mismatch. Validation across hexagonal, square, rectangular, and oblique two-dimensional lattices confirms universality, establishing interface strain engineering as a general design principle that bridges electronic structure to nanoscale failure, enabling rational design of damage-tolerant nanostructures."

Further, we clarify the meaning of entropy as the uncertainty arising from unconstrained degrees of freedom and separate configurational contributions from intra-configurational ones. Building on this, we derive the partition function, as used in zentropy, by maximizing entropy in its recursive form. The resulting framework is exact for a chosen level of description and enables principled coarse-graining, thereby reducing computational complexity while preserving thermodynamic consistency. These results position zentropy as a rigorous bridge between microscopic and macroscopic behavior, facilitating quantitative predictions and the study of emergent phenomena."

This study uses Ne$^{+}$ ion irradiation at fluences from $10^{11}$ to $10^{14}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$ to systematically vary defect densities in 80 nm epitaxial FeGe films and quantify the resulting modifications to magnetic phase boundaries and electronic scattering. Temperature- and field-dependent Hall measurements reveal that increasing disorder progressively extends the topological Hall signal from a narrow window near 200\\~K in pristine films down to 4\\~K at the highest fluence, with peak amplitude more than doubling. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect transitions from quadratic Berry curvature scaling to linear skew scattering behavior, with the skew coefficient increasing threefold. These results establish quantitative correlations between defect concentration, skyrmion phase space, and transport mechanisms in a chiral magnet. It demonstrates that ion-beam modification provides systematic control over both topological texture stability and electrical detectability."

Ultrabroadband THz far-field spectroscopy (0.15-16 THz) distinguishes doped graphene layers near the substrate from quasi-neutral layers (QNLs) further from the substrate. Temperature-dependent THz conductivity spectra are dominated by intra-band transitions both in the doped and QNLs. Photoexcitation then alters mainly the response of the QNLs: these exhibit a very high carrier mobility and a large positive THz photoconductivity with picosecond lifetime. The response of QNLs strongly depends on the carrier temperature $T_c$: the scattering time drops by an order of magnitude down to ~10 fs upon an increase of $T_c$ from 50 K to $T_c >$ 1000 K, which is attributed to an enhanced electron-electron and electron- phonon scattering and to an interaction of electrons with mid-gap states."

      "summary": "The Kagome lattice has attracted extensive attention due to the diverse magnetic properties and non-trivial electronic states generated by its unique atomic arrangement, which provides an excellent system for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior. Here, we report the anomalous transport properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals. The quadratic and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) can be observed depending on the directions of the field and the current. Integrating Hall resistivity and quantum oscillation measurements, we found that the LMR could match well with the Abrikosov model. However, this model encounters difficulties in explaining the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. To solve the issue, we extrapolate the Abrikosov model to the case of two-dimensional linear dispersion. It was found that when the field is parallel to the linear dependence momentum, the quantized energy is $\\epsilon_n^{\\pm}$ = $\\pm v\\sqrt{p^2+2eHn/c}$, resulting in LMR. By contrast, when it is parallel to the non-linear dependence momentum, the energy is $\\epsilon_n^{\\pm}$ = $\\pm v\\sqrt{2eHn/c}$, without yielding LMR. Through the combination of experiment and theory, the modified Abrikosov model could interpret the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. The present research provides a new perspective for understanding the LMR behavior."

We show that, in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers, rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault model of the compound."

In contrast, ultrafast melting is governed by the microscopic response to a rapid energy input and, thus, can reveal the strength and dynamics of atomic bonds as well as the energy flow rate to the lattice. Accurately describing these processes remains challenging and requires detailed insights into transient states encountered. Here, we present data from femtosecond electron diffraction measurements that capture the structural evolution of copper during the ultrafast solid to liquid phase transformations. At absorbed energy densities 2 to 4 times the melting threshold, melting begins at the surface slightly below the nominal melting point followed by rapid homogeneous melting throughout the volume. Molecular dynamics simulations reproduce these observations and reveal a weak electron lattice energy transfer rate for the given experimental conditions. Both simulations and experiments show no indications of rapid lattice collapse when its temperature surpasses proposed limits of superheating, providing evidence that inherent dynamics limits the speed of disordering in ultrafast melting of metals."

To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum dots."

The CLS form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice. Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\\pi$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids."

Our simulations are performed for excitation of the strongly bound intralayer exciton of an inversion-symmetric homobilayer of MoS2 with in-plane electric fields. We demonstrate that for resonant excitation at the 1s K-exciton the SHG and the THG show complex dependencies on both the strength of the static field and the peak amplitude of the optical pulse. For sufficiently intense optical excitation, the THG increases and the SHG increases superlinearly with the amplitude of the static field as long as exciton ionization is not yet dominating. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that these dependencies arise from an interplay between several effects including static and transient Stark shifts, exciton ionization, Wannier-Stark localization, off-resonant Rabi oscillations, and a modified interference between optical nonlinearities induced by the intraband acceleration. Our findings offer several new possibilities for controlling the strong-field dynamics of systems with strongly bound excitons."

Our approach is based on an effective single particle Hamiltonian which mimics the alternating spin splitting characteristic for the $d$-$wave$ and $i$-$wave$ altermagnetic state. By supplementing the model with intersite pairing term we characterize the principal features of the coexistent altermagnetic-superconducting state as well as the possibility of inducing the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase. Our calculations show that the subtle interplay between the symmetries of the superconducting and altermagnetic order parameters as well as the shape/size of the Fermi surface lead to various types of anisotropic behaviors of the resultant non-zero momentum pairing, which has not been possible in the originally proposed FFLO state. Moreover, in the considered systems additional pairing symmetries appear leading to an exotic multi-component order parameter with singlet-triplet mixing. To interpret the obtained data we analyze the Cooper pair density in the momentum space and the corresponding Fermi wave vector mismatch resulting from the altermagnetic spin splitting. We discuss our result in the context of possible applications like, e.g., the superconducting diode."

Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin precession in real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the Hall voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor. The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications."

As a result, we confirm the intertwined nature of CDW and PDW fluctuating orders for intermediate-to-strong couplings. We also verify that, while an applied magnetic field favors the formation of a CDW and allows the subsequent emergence of a PDW as a secondary order, strain effects favor unidirectional PDW as a primary order over the subdominant appearance of a stripe-like CDW. These results underscore the value of the HK model as an interesting platform in order to investigate (via an exactly solvable framework) the emergence of charge order and unconventional superconductivity in fermionic systems with strong interactions. Finally, we briefly discuss an orbital generalization of the HK model, which has been recently argued to be relevant to describe the properties of realistic strongly correlated systems."

While simple theories predict coarsening until only macroscopically large phases remain, concrete models often exhibit patterns with finite length scales. To unify such models, we here propose a general field-theoretic model that combines phase separation with non-local interactions. Our analysis reveals that long-range interactions generally suppress coarsening, whereas systems with non-local short-range interactions additionally exhibit a continuous phase transition to patterned phases. Only the latter system allows for the coexistence of homogeneous and patterned phases, which we explain by mapping to the conserved Swift-Hohenberg model. Taken together, our generic model reveals an underlying framework that describes similar phenomena observed in many complex phase-separating systems."

Here, we report the effect of uniaxial stress on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the hexagonal frustrated antiferromagnetic Heusler compound Mn3Ge. Our x-ray diffraction results show that the c/a ratio varies linearly with strain when stress is applied along the a axis, as well as a significantly higher Young's modulus along the c direction. The linear behavior of the c/a ratio under uniaxial stress mirrors that seen under hydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa, but results in a characteristically different behavior of the AHE. Stress applied along the a axis induces a distortion in the ab plane, smoothing the abrupt jump in the AHE signal at zero magnetic field. In contrast, stress applied along the c axis has little effect, presumably due to the higher Young's modulus. We argue that this is due to pronounced changes in magnetic order."

      "summary": "Bi alloying is predicted to transform GaAs from a semiconductor to a topological insulator or semi-metal. To date, studies of the GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ alloy band structure have been limited, and the origins of Bi-induced enhancement of the spin-orbit splitting energy, $\\Delta_\\mathrm{SO}$, are unresolved. Here, we present high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of droplet-free epitaxial GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ films with $x_{\\mathrm{Bi}}$ = 0.06. In addition to quantifying the Bi-induced shifts of the light-hole and heavy-hole valence bands, we probe the origins of the Bi-enhanced $\\Delta_\\mathrm{SO}$. Using exact-two-component density functional theory calculations, we identify the key role of Bi p-orbitals in the upward shift of the light-hole and heavy-hole bands that results in the Bi-enhanced $\\Delta_\\mathrm{SO}$."

Building on the known mapping between the kicked rotor and the Anderson model, we show that both interparticle interactions and quasiperiodic modulations of the kicking strength can independently and simultaneously generate synthetic dimensions. In the absence of modulation, interactions between two bosons already promote an effective two-dimensional Anderson model. Introducing one or two additional incommensurate frequencies further extends the system to three and four effective dimensions, respectively. Through extensive numerical simulations of the two-body dynamics and finite-time scaling analysis, we observe Anderson localization and the associated critical behavior characteristic of the orthogonal universality class. This combined use of interactions and quasiperiodic driving thus provides a versatile framework for emulating Anderson localization and its transition in arbitrary dimensions."

This work presents a systematic approach to optimize the antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method, where the experimental design is guided by a theoretical methods at each step. A synergistic 9:1 (v/v) DMSO/DMF binary solvent was selected to balance solubility and kinetics, a choice rationalized by an analysis of Gutmann's donor numbers. Subsequently, ethanol was selected as a promising antisolvent by evaluating its properties against key criteria of miscibility and diffusion rate using Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and Fick's law expressed in terms of saturated vapor pressure. Within this rationally-defined chemical system, the \"growth window\" was experimentally mapped, identifying an optimal precursor concentration of 0.35 M and a preliminary titration step to induce a controlled metastable state. The optimized protocol consistently yields phase-pure, orthorhombic CsPbBr$_3$ SCs up to 1 cm in size within one week at room temperature. The resulting crystals exhibit high crystallinity and thermal stability up to \\SI{550}{\\celsius}"

We show that physical observables such as nonlinear optical and Hall responses can be obtained from compact on-shell amplitudes, bypassing the complexity of Feynman diagrams. As a concrete demonstration, we derive the nonlinear Hall conductivity of a Dirac semimetal from a single parity-odd three-photon amplitude, highlighting the analytic and conceptual power of amplitude-based approaches for strongly correlated condensed-matter systems."

Our analysis focuses on planar diffusion dynamics and their coarse-grained approximations by discrete-state Markov chains. Using finite-volume approximations, we derive an approximate master equation directly from the underlying diffusion and show that this discretisation preserves key features of the nonequilibrium steady-state. In particular, we show that the entropy production rate of the approximation converges as the number of discrete states goes to the limit. These results are illustrated with analytically solvable diffusions and numerical experiments on nonlinear processes, demonstrating how this approach can be used to explore the dependence of entropy production rate on model parameters. Finally, we address the problem of inferring discrete-state Markov models from continuous stochastic trajectories. We show that discrete-state models significantly underestimate the true entropy production rate. However, we also show that they can provide tests to determine if a stationary planar diffusion is out of equilibrium. This property is illustrated with both simulated data and empirical trajectories from schooling fish."

The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($\\gamma=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism.

Beyond the conventional deterministic spin-transfer torque, we identify an intrinsic channel for the transfer of spin quantum fluctuations. By extending the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to include both quantum and thermal stochastic fields, we reveal a temperature regime where quantum fluctuations dominate spin dynamics. Furthermore, voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy can exponentially amplify these quantum fluctuation signals, enabling their binary detection via tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions. These results establish a microscopic framework for quantum fluctuation-driven spin dynamics and provide a fundamental route toward spin-based quantum true random number generation."

Here, we define the saturation defect concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{sat}}$) as the highest defect density that still allows the total mobility to remain within 90\\% of the phonon-limited value, providing a direct measure of how many defects a device can tolerate. Based on $C_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, we find a clear ranking of defect impact: selenium substituting for sulfur is relatively tolerant, with $C_{\\mathrm{sat}}\\approx2.07\\times10^{-4}$, while selenium vacancies are the most sensitive, with $C_{\\mathrm{sat}}\\approx3.65\\times10^{-5}$. Our $C_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ benchmarks and defect hierarchy provide quantitative, materials-specific design rules that can guide the fabrication of high-mobility field-effect transistors, electronic devices, and sensors based on Janus MoSSe."

The technique is based on optimizing the agreement between experimental and calculated intensities. Today, the most commonly used measure of agreement is Pendry's $R$ factor $R_\\mathrm{P}$. While $R_\\mathrm{P}$ has many advantages, it also has severe shortcomings, as it is a noisy target function for optimization and very sensitive to small offsets of the intensity. Furthermore, $R_\\mathrm{P} = 0$, which is meant to imply perfect agreement between two $I(E)$ curves can also be achieved by qualitatively very different curves. We present a modified $R$ factor $R_\\mathrm{S}$, which can be used as a direct replacement for $R_\\mathrm{P}$, but avoids these shortcomings. We also demonstrate that $R_\\mathrm{S}$ is as good as $R_\\mathrm{P}$ or better in steering the optimization to the correct result in the case of imperfections of the experimental data, while another common $R$ factor, $R_\\mathrm{ZJ}$ (suggested by Zanazzi and Jona) is worse in this respect."

The branch points of the ABC star terpolymers are localized in core regions, modeled as cylinders in three dimensions, and our framework is applicable to morphologies with single and multiple core types. Our central idea is that all the structures we wish to model can be assembled from a flexible base motif, which we call Strongly Segregated Polygons. This method is useful for exploring a wide range of complex morphologies, using a range of compositions and interaction strengths. We focus on 2D morphologies of ABC star terpolymers, but our method could be extended into three dimensions and to other molecular architectures, and in principle to large, irregular quasiperiodic two-dimensional structures."

Starting from poroelasticity theory, the equilibrium equations governing the LC were formulated and analytically solved by applying appropriate mechanical and hydraulic boundary conditions. The results indicate that both strain and stress measures (in the form of shear strain and von Mises stress) peak in the peripheral region of the LC, which is currently suspected to be the initial site of glaucomatous damage. These quantities increase with IOP, suggesting a pressure-dependent mechanical insult to the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. In parallel, the model predicts a monotonic reduction in fluid content as IOP rises, which may contribute to ischemic phenomena and disc haemorrhages. The influence of material anisotropy was also examined, revealing that isotropic assumptions tend to underestimate the fluid content while overestimating shear strain. Given the current experimental challenges in measuring blood flow within the LC, the proposed model provides a valuable framework for exploring the coupled mechanical hemodynamic behavior of the tissue and for inverse estimation of its mechanical parameters, such as the stiffness of the opening for the central retinal vessels."

The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena."

      "summary": "Materials used in nuclear reactors are constantly exposed to the effects of neutron irradiation, which leads to changes in their mechanical properties. In particular, the steels employed in reactor pressure vessels experience a reduction in the ductile-to brittle transition temperature. Given that the pressure vessel is a non-redundant component, understanding this phenomenon is of significant interest. In this work, we focus on studying the effects of accelerated irradiation by maintaining constant neutron fluence while varying neutron flux, which results in different lead factors. This approach enables the extrapolation of accelerated test results to real operational conditions of the reactor pressure vessels. In our study, we analyzed irradiated steels using three magnetic techniques. Each technique responds differently to the microstructural changes induced by irradiation, allowing for a better characterization of its effects on the material. Through DC magnetometry, the analysis of minor loops shows that the remanence, coercivity, and saturation of the steel depend not only on the fluence with which the material was irradiated but also on the irradiation rate, which means, more specifically, on the lead factor. The AC susceptibility technique shows that the response of the irradiated steel to the applied magnetic field increases with fluence but also with the lead factor. For the real part of XAC, there is an increase with the lead factor, while the imaginary component of XAC grows with the size of the nanoprecipitates. Finally, Barkhausen noise measurements show a clear increase in the RMS of the signal with the lead factor."

Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system. Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the ratio between the two-level splitting $\\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\\omega$ satisfies $\\Delta/\\omega \\gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states. Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime where $\\Delta/\\omega \\gg 1$."

      "summary": "Neural network quantum states emerge as a promising tool for solving quantum many-body problems. However, its successes and limitations are still not well-understood in particular for Fermions with complex sign structures. Based on our recent work [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 21, 10252-10262 (2025)], we generalizes the restricted Boltzmann machine to a more general class of states for Fermions, formed by product of `neurons' and hence will be referred to as neuron product states (NPS). NPS builds correlation in a very different way, compared with the closely related correlator product states (CPS) [H. J. Changlani, et al. Phys. Rev. B, 80, 245116 (2009)], which use full-rank local correlators. In constrast, each correlator in NPS contains long-range correlations across all the sites, with its representational power constrained by the simple function form. We prove that products of such simple nonlocal correlators can approximate any wavefunction arbitrarily well under certain mild conditions on the form of activation functions. In addition, we also provide elementary proofs for the universal approximation capabilities of feedforward neural network (FNN) and neural network backflow (NNBF) in second quantization. Together, these results provide a deeper insight into the neural network representation of many-body wavefunctions in second quantization."

      "summary": "Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for investigating molecular structures, orientations, and dynamics at surfaces. However, its spatial resolution is fundamentally restricted to the micrometer scale by the optical diffraction limit. Tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) using a scanning tunneling microscope has been developed to overcome this limitation. The acquired spectra exhibit characteristic dips originating from vibrational responses located within the strong broadband non-resonant background (NRB), which distorts and obscures the molecular signals. By making the second pulse temporally asymmetric and introducing a controlled delay between the first and second laser pulses, the NRB was effectively suppressed, which in turn amplified the vibrational response through interference and facilitated the detection of weak vibrational signals. This interference also made the technique phase-sensitive, enabling the determination of absolute molecular orientations. Furthermore, forward- and backward-scattered signals were simultaneously detected, conclusively confirming that the observed signals originated from tip enhancement rather than far-field contributions. Finally, the signal enhancement factor in TE-SFG was estimated to be $6.3\\times 10^6-1.3\\times 10^7$, based on the experimental data. This phase-sensitive TE-SFG technique overcomes the optical diffraction limit and enables the investigation of molecular vibrations at surfaces with unprecedented detail."

This work establishes analogous relations for \\textit{thermodynamically} conjugate variables -- specifically, a classical intensive parameter $\\theta$ and its corresponding extensive quantum operator $\\hat{O}$ -- in equilibrium states. We develop a framework to derive a rigorous thermodynamic uncertainty relation for such pairs, where the uncertainty of the classical parameter $\\theta$ is quantified by its quantum Fisher information $\\mathcal{F}_\\theta$. The framework is based on an exact integral representation that relates $\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta}$ to the autocorrelation function of operator $\\hat{O}$. From this representation, we derive a tight upper bound for the quantum Fisher information, which yields a thermodynamic uncertainty relation: $\\Delta\\theta\\,\\overline{\\Delta O} \\ge k_\\text{B}T$ with $\\overline{\\Delta O}\\equiv\\partial_\\theta\\langle\\hat{O}\\rangle\\,\\Delta\\theta$ and $T$ is the system temperature.

      "summary": "Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments."

Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or large amounts of configurations, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as DFT. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires $3N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces, which is not negligible as the system size increases. This paper presents a way to replace the $3N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. This improves the computational cost and scalability of the method. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the corrected VMC forces with those obtained by the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are significantly biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values much closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones."

Further limiting to systems described by real wave functions, our formalism recovers the well-known result that the fidelity between two probability mass functions is the generating function of the classical Fisher information matrix, indicating a hierarchy of quantum to information geometry. The Bloch representation of the generating functions is given explicitly for $2\\times 2$ density matrices, and the application to canonical ensemble of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model suggests the mitigation of quantum geometry at finite temperature."

This study compares Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) in modeling quantum probability distributions for the H$_{2}^+$ ion, leveraging data generated via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While ANN achieved superior accuracy (R$^2$ = 0.99 vs ANFIS's 0.95 with Gaussian membership functions), it required over 50x more parameters (2,305 vs 39-45). ANFIS, however, provided unique interpretability: its Gaussian membership functions encoded spatial electron localization near proton positions ($\\mu = 1.2 A$), mirroring Born probability densities, while fuzzy rules reflected quantum superposition principles. Rules prioritizing the internuclear direction revealed the system's 1D symmetry, aligning with Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals theory--a novel data-driven perspective on orbital hybridization. Membership function variances ($\\sigma$) further quantified electron delocalization trends, and peak prediction errors highlighted unresolved quantum cusps. The choice of functions critically impacted performance: Gaussian/Generalized Bell outperformed Sigmoid, with errors improving as training data increased, showing scalability. This study underscores the context-dependent value of ML: ANN for precision and ANFIS for interpretable, parameter-efficient approximations that link inputs to physical behavior. These findings advocate hybrid approaches in quantum simulations, balancing accuracy with explainability to accelerate discovery. Future work should extend ANFIS to multi-electron systems and integrate domain-specific constraints (e.g., kinetic energy terms), bridging data-driven models and fundamental physics."

Classical covalent chemistry of carbon concerns molecular substances whose valence bond structure includes segregate or chained single sp3C-C bonds. Substances with double sp2C-C and triple sp1C-C bonds are the subject of spin covalent chemistry of carbon. The mathematical apparatus of spin covalence forms the basis of algorithms governing the chemical modification of carbon substances, polymerization processes, and catalysis involving them, making it possible to supplement the empirical spin covalent chemistry of carbon with its virtual analog."

However, this idealization may not always be applicable in experimental settings, where dissipation can be frequency-dependent. Such frequency-dependent dissipation leads to non-Markovian behavior. In this work, we demonstrate how a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model, a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system with nonreciprocal hopping, arises microscopically in a quasi-one-dimensional dissipative lattice. This is achieved using non-equilibrium Green's functions without requiring any approximation like weak system-bath coupling or a time-scale separation, which would have been necessary for a Markovian treatment. The resulting effective system exhibits nonreciprocal hopping, as well as uniform dissipation, both of which are frequency-dependent. This holds for both bosonic and fermionic settings. We find solely non-Markovian nonreciprocal features like unidirectional frequency blocking in bosonic setting, and a non-equilibrium dissipative quantum phase transition in fermionic setting, that cannot be captured in a Markovian theory, nor have any analog in reciprocal systems. Our results lay the groundwork for describing and engineering non-Markovian nonreciprocal quantum lattices."

Progress is complicated by lacking understanding how TLS are created and in which parts of a qubit circuit they are most detrimental. Here, we present a method to determine the individual positions of TLS at the surface of a transmon qubit. We employ a set of on-chip gate electrodes near the qubit to generate local DC electric fields that are used to tune the TLS' resonance frequencies. The TLS position is inferred from the strengths at which TLS couple to different electrodes and comparing them to electric field simulations. We found that the majority of detectable surface-TLS was residing on the leads of the qubit's Josephson junction, despite the dominant contribution of its coplanar capacitor to electric field energy and surface area. This indicates that the TLS density is significantly enhanced near shadow-evaporated electrodes fabricated by lift-off techniques. Our method is useful to identify critical circuit regions where TLS contribute most to decoherence, and can guide improvements in qubit design and fabrication methods."

      "summary": "Glassy dynamics in active biological cells remain a subject of debate, as cellular activity rarely slows enough for true glassy features to emerge. In this study, we address this paradox of glassy dynamics in epithelial cells by integrating experimental observations with an active vertex model. We demonstrate that while crowding is essential, it is not sufficient for glassy dynamics to emerge. A mechanochemical feedback loop (MCFL), mediated by cell shape changes through the contractile actomyosin network, is also required to drive glass transition in dense epithelial tissues, as revealed via a crosstalk between actin-based cell clustering and dynamic heterogeneity in the experiments. Incorporating the MCFL into the vertex model reveals that glassy dynamics can emerge even at high cellular activity if the strength of the MCFL remains high. We show that the MCFL can counteract cell division-induced fluidisation and enable glassy dynamics to emerge through active cell-to-cell communication. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the existence of novel collective mechanochemical oscillations that arise from the crosstalk of two MCFLs. Together, we demonstrate that an interplay between crowding and active mechanochemical feedback enables the emergence of glass-like traits and collective biochemical oscillations in epithelial tissues with active cell-cell contacts."

The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale.

The mechanism is rooted in the intrinsic nonequilibrium steady state associated with local nonchaoticity. In the current investigation, we experimentally validate this concept, with the weak gravitational force in the \"toy model\" being changed to the strong Coulomb force. The tests are performed on a set of nanoporous carbon electrodes immersed in aqueous cesium pivalate solutions. The key characteristic is that the effective nanopore size is only slightly larger than the effective ion size, less than twice the ion size. At first glance, the supercapacitive cells exhibit \"normal\" charge curves. However, the steady-state distribution of the large ions in the charged small nanopores inherently differs from thermodynamic equilibrium, because of the confinement effect of the nanopore walls. The measured potential difference is nearly one order of magnitude larger than the upper limit calculated from the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Although counterintuitive, such a phenomenon is consistent with the molecular dynamics simulations in open literature."

One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from the self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves and construct the corresponding phase diagram, which is also applicable to general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems."

      "summary": "Active nematics are fluids in which the components have nematic symmetry and are driven out of equilibrium due to the microscopic generation of an active stress. When the active stress is high, it drives flows in the nematic and can lead to the proliferation of topological defects, a state we refer to as defect chaos. Using numerical simulations of active nematics, we observe energy transfer between length scales during defect chaos. We demonstrate that this energy transfer is driven by the exchange between variations in the orientation and degree of order in the nematic that predominantly occur during defect creation and annihilation. We then show that the primary features of energy transfer during defect chaos scale with the active length scale. Finally, we identify a second regime that features few defects, but rather bend walls. Similar to topological defects, these bend walls co-localize variations in the orientation with variations in the scalar order parameter leading to energy transfer."

On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems."

      "summary": "In ultrathin ferromagnetic films sandwiched between two distinct heavy metal layers or between a heavy metal and an oxide layer, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is of interfacial origin. Its chirality and strength are determined by the properties of the adjacent heavy metals and the degree of oxidation at the interfaces. Here, we demonstrate that the DMI chirality can change solely with variations in the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer - an effect that has not been experimentally studied in details or explained until now. Our experimental observation in the trilayer system Ta/FeCoB/TaOx is supported by ab initio calculations: they reveal that variations in orbital filling and inter-atomic distances at the interface, driven by the structural relaxations in the ultrathin regime, lead to an inversion of DMI chirality. We hence propose a new degree of freedom to tune DMI chirality and the associated chiral spin textures by tailoring crystal structure e.g. using strain or surface acoustic waves."

      "summary": "Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement\" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments."

      "summary": "This article is dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and presents a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic, and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds not possessing symmetry in respect of space and time inversion but are symmetric in respect of the product of these operations. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermagnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in combinations with rotations and reflections of a crystal lattice. Similar splitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types of materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets, there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas, in altermagnets, we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state."

      "summary": "Understanding the mechanical properties of active suspensions is crucial for their potential applications in materials engineering. Among the various phenomena in active matter that have no analogue in equilibrium systems, motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in active colloidal suspensions is one of the most extensively studied. However, the mechanical properties of this fundamental active state of matter remain poorly understood. This study investigates the rheology of a suspension of active colloidal particles under constant and oscillatory shear. Systems consisting of pseudo-hard active Brownian particles exhibiting co-existence of dense and dilute phases behave as a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid at low and high frequencies, displaying exclusively shear thinning across a wide range of densities and activities. Remarkably, the cross-over point between the storage and loss moduli is non-monotonic, rising with activity before the MIPS transition but falling with activity after the transition, revealing the subtleties of how active forces and intrinsically out-of-equilibrium phases affect the mechanical properties of these systems."

The rapid advancement of solid-state technologies has significantly improved qubit quality, including the time scales characterizing electrical operation, relaxation, and dephasing. At this stage of development, understanding the relations between the underlying spin-orbit coupling and experimental parameters, such as quantum dot geometry and external electric and magnetic fields, has become a priority. Here we focus on a Ge hole double quantum dot in the Pauli spin blockade regime and present a complete analysis of the leakage current under an out-of-plane magnetic field. By considering a model of anisotropic in-plane confinement and $k^3$-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we determine the behaviour of the leakage current as a function of detuning, magnetic field magnitude, interdot distance, and individual dot ellipticities. We identify regions in which the leakage current can be suppressed by quantum dot geometry designs. Most importantly, by rotating one of the quantum dots, we observe that the quantum dot shape induces a strongly anisotropic leakage current. These findings provide guidelines for probing the spin-orbit coupling, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the precision of Pauli spin blockade readout in hole qubit architectures."

Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Ghosh - Pan Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed."

      "summary": "Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications."

      "summary": "Interactions between charged colloidal particles are profoundly influenced by charge regulation and charge renormalization, rendering the effective potential highly sensitive to local particle density. In this work, we investigate how a dynamically evolving, density-dependent Yukawa interaction affects the stability of out-of-equilibrium colloidal structures. Motivated by a series of experiments where unexpectedly long-lived colloidal crystals have suggested the presence of like-charged attractions, we systematically explore the role of charge regulation and charge renormalization. Using Poisson-Boltzmann cell theory, we compute the effective colloidal charge and screening length as a function of packing fraction. These results are subsequently incorporated into Brownian dynamics simulations that dynamically resolve the evolving colloid charge as a function of time and local density. In the case of slow relaxation dynamics, our results show that incorporating these charging effects significantly prolongs the lifetimes of out-of-equilibrium colloidal crystals, providing an explanation for the experimental observation of long-lived crystals. These findings demonstrate that the interplay of surface charge dynamics and colloidal interactions can give rise to complex and rich nonequilibrium behavior in charged colloidal suspensions, opening new pathways for tuning colloidal stability through electrostatic feedback mechanisms."

According to this property, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau action from the microscopic Hamiltonian of the BCS theory for the tilted Dirac cone materials. This derivation is performed near the critical point within the framework of curved spacetime. The novelty of the present work lies in deriving a general Ginzburg-Landau action that depends on spacetime curvature, where the curvature is tuned by an external electric field. Furthermore, this finding enables us to apply the Ginzburg-Landau theory at high temperatures by changing the spacetime metric, potentially offering insights into achieving high-temperature superconductivity in these materials."

By confining thermal excitation to microsecond timescales, this approach minimizes lateral heat diffusion, reduces heat capacity addenda to below 10^{-9} J K^{-1}, and achieves noise densities as low as 75 pJ K^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} mm^{-2}, unlocking precise thermodynamic characterization of subnanogram samples in areas as small as 30 x 30 \\mu m^{2}. The method delivers exceptional temperature homogeneity, as demonstrated by resolving sharp phase transitions, such as the antiferromagnetic transition in ultrathin CoO films, with unprecedented clarity. Its quasi-static operation is inherently compatible with external stimuli, including magnetic and electric fields, thereby expanding its utility for in-operando thermodynamic studies.

However, most universal MLIPs overfit to narrow datasets or computational protocols, limiting their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%) and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni, achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains."

However, directly probing these complex interface conditions remains challenging. Here, we reveal the coupled in-plane strain and out-of-plane bonding conditions in strain-engineered WS2 flakes by combining dual-harmonic electrostatic force microscopy (DH-EFM) and scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM). A striking contradiction is observed between the compressive-strain-induced larger bandgap (lower electrical conductivity) detected by DH-EFM, and the enhanced conductivity probed by sMIM. Comparative measurements under different sMIM modes demonstrate that this contradiction originates from a tip-loading-force-induced dynamic puckering effect, which is governed by the interfacial bonding strength. Furthermore, the progressive accumulation and subsequent release of conductivity during forward/backward sMIM-contact scans further confirms this dynamic puckering behavior, revealing pronounced differences in interface conditions between the open- and closed-ring regions of WS2. This work resolves the correlation between electrical properties and interface conditions, and provides fundamental insights for interface-engineered devices."

      "summary": "Detecting L\\'evy flights of cells has been a challenging problem in experiments. The challenge lies in accessing data in spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, which is necessary for reliably extracting a power-law scaling. Differential dynamic microscopy has been shown to be a powerful method that allows one to acquire statistics of cell motion across scales, which is a potentially versatile method for detecting L\\'evy walks in biological systems. In this article, we extend the differential dynamic microscopy method to self-propelled L\\'evy particles, whose run-time distribution has a algebraic tail. We validate our protocol using synthetic imaging data and show that a reliable detection of active L\\'evy particles requires accessing length scales of one order of magnitude larger than its persistence length. Applying the protocol to experimental data of E. coli and E. gracilis, we find that E. coli does not exhibit a signature of L\\'evy walks, while E. gracilis is better described as active L\\'evy particles."

      "summary": "We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles. For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm occ}$ with the flavor part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\\rm occ}$ reduces to the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime, this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk thermodynamics."

      "summary": "Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinite layer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta."

      "summary": "The supercurrent diode effect (SDE), characterized by nonreciprocal critical currents, represents a promising building block for future dissipationless electronics and quantum circuits. Realizing SDE requires breaking both time-reversal and inversion symmetry in the device. Here we use conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) lithography to pattern reconfigurable superconducting weak links (WLs) at the LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) interface. By deliberately engineering the WL geometry at the nanoscale, we realize SDE in these devices in the presence of modest out-of-plane magnetic fields. The SDE polarity can be reversed by simply changing the WL position, and the rectification efficiency reaches up to 13% under optimal magnetic field conditions. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations reveal that the observed SDE originates from asymmetric vortex motion in the inversion-symmetry-breaking device geometry. This demonstration of SDE in the LAO/KTO system establishes a versatile platform for investigating and engineering vortex dynamics, forming the basis for engineered quantum circuit elements."

While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process."

Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called $R$-parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication."

We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Quasiparticle band structures are fundamental for understanding strongly correlated electron systems. While solving these structures accurately on classical computers is challenging, quantum computing offers a promising alternative. Specifically, the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) method, combined with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), provides a quantum algorithm for calculating quasiparticle band structures. However, optimizing the variational parameters in VQE becomes increasingly difficult as the system size grows, due to device noise, statistical noise, and the barren plateau problem. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that combines QSE with the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method for calculating quasiparticle band structures. QSCI may leverage the VQE ansatz as an input state but, unlike the standard VQE, it does not require full optimization of the variational parameters, making it more scalable for larger quantum systems. Based on this approach, we demonstrate the quantum computation of the quasiparticle band structure of a silicon using 16 qubits on an IBM quantum processor."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\\Delta t$ with the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the same thermal steady state for both settings, although even in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents. Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme. Finally, we consider how our results are impacted when the system-environment interaction leads to strict homogenisation. Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of non-Markovian interactions."

The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020)."

The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter."

Unlike TRAF6, LUBAC is largely dispensable for activating NF-﻿κB, but it modifies BCL10 and regulates MALT1 protease activity by controlling substrate selectivity."
