By probing spin orientation and magnetic anisotropy at ultra-low fields, key energy scales — the spin–orbit coupling and intervalley Hund’s exchange — have been extracted, shedding new light on the phase hierarchy in strongly correlated electron systems."

A setup allows inducing magnetic hyperthermia using an alternating magnetic field while simultaneously measuring the magneto-induced birefringence and optical absorption. As the temperature increases, the birefringence and absorption of magnetic nanoparticles decrease and vice versa. These findings offer a noninvasive and nondestructive method for probing temperature, and in particular provide a way to measure local temperature. [Phys. Rev.

This work introduces a general framework to study how symmetry-breaking impurities influence the relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems. The authors analytically show that the remnants of the original symmetries can persist for long times, leading to slow relaxation in correlation functions with a larger power-law decay exponent or long prethermal plateaus. The methods apply to both conventional symmetries, such as charge conservation, and unconventional ones like Hilbert space fragmentation. [Phys. Rev. B 112, 155108] Published Thu Oct 02, 2025"
