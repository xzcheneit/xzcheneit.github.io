      "summary": "Recent measurements on 2d materials tuning between fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases and a plethora of correlated electronic states call for a detailed understanding of the dynamics of anyons. Here we develop a general theory of the statistical mechanics of anyon gases at finite temperature, valid in regimes where the anyons are sufficiently dilute and can be treated as weakly interacting particles. We find that with a minimal set of universal braiding and fusion data, along with information about the hierarchy of anyon gaps, it is possible to construct a distribution function for any dilute anyon gas, as well as derive thermodynamic observables. Our results are built on an anyon exclusion principle manifesting as a constraint on fusion outcomes of physical states. Our approach unifies and streamlines a range of results for itinerant anyon models, from solvable lattice Hamiltonians to large-N field theories."

      "summary": "We study the relationship between the quantities that encode the insulating properties of matter: the ground-state quantum metric, the average localization length, and the electric susceptibility. By examining the one-dimensional Anderson insulator model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with chiral disorder, we demonstrate that the former two measures are proportional in one-dimensional systems near criticality, and both are determined by the properties of the hybridized localized states around the Fermi energy. We employ these insights to demonstrate that the behavior of the electric susceptibility is drastically different in the bond-disordered SSH chain, with the possibility that it may diverge even when the localization length and the quantum metric remain finite. This divergence, caused by the proliferation of impurity resonances at a particular energy, leads to a novel regime that exhibits mixed characteristics of metals and insulators. We term this regime superdielectric: an insulating state characterized by a finite quantum metric and divergent static electric susceptibility, which implies perfect screening in the absence of the dc conductivity. We demonstrate that the superdielectric phase also emerges in higher-dimensional materials, such as graphene with vacancies and Kekul\\'e bond distortion."

      "summary": "A challenge in the study of conformal field theory (CFT) is to characterize the possible defects in specific bulk CFTs. Given the success of numerical bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects. We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous evidence that the $\\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to domain wall proliferation."

      "summary": "In this work, we investigate the nature of magnetic interactions in intrinsic magnetic topological insulator Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (MBST in short) systems, which possesses highly-ordered ferromagnetic septuple-layers (SLs), using two types of structures: MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 heterostructures and MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3/MBST(1 SL) sandwich structures. The out-of-plane magnetization in the sandwich structure turned out to be significantly larger than that in the heterostructure, indicating that the interlayer magnetic interaction between two MBST layers is ferromagnetic. Furthermore, the Curie temperature increased with decreasing the in-plane Mn-Mn distance in the MBST layer, which suggests the enhancement of the intralayer ferromagnetic interaction within each MBST layer. Meanwhile, in the sandwich structures with various spacer thicknesses, the Curie temperature with the spacer layer was higher than that with no spacer layer. In addition, the curve shape of anomalous Hall effects for the sandwich structure was almost unchanged by carrier-density modulation, which implies that the ferromagnetism in this system is carrier-independent. Based on the above results, magnetic behaviors in our systems cannot be explained only by the direct exchange nor superexchange interactions reported previously for MBST systems, and are instead proposed to arise from topology-related mechanisms such as the van Vleck and Bloembergen-Rowland mechanisms. This work provides a new perspective on magnetic mechanisms in MBST systems, which helps us to realize next-generation spintronic and electronic devices by flexibly controlling magnetism in intrinsic magnetic topological insulators."

      "summary": "RuO$_{2}$ has been proposed as the prototypical altermagnetic material. However, several reports have recently questioned its intrinsic magnetic ordering, leading to conflicting findings, especially in thin film heterostructures pointing to possible interface effects being convoluted with supposed antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic signatures. Here, extensive magnetometry measurements were performed on two independently grown thin film heterostructures of RuO$_{2}$ interfaced with either NiFe or Fe acting as the ferromagnetic layer. Below about 15 K, both samples exhibit exchange bias fields when cooled to approximately 2 K in a $+$1 T field, and a spin transitional feature is observed around 31 K. Magneto-Raman measurements on RuO$_{2}$ thin films only reveal a magnon mode when there is a NiFe layer, suggesting that RuO$_{2}$ does not intrinsically possess long range magnetic ordering.. When in contact with a ferromagnet, RuO$_2$ displays effects that could be ascribed to antiferromagnetism. However, the lack of intrinsic magnon modes points toward possible diffusion between the layers or spin disorder at the interface as seen by density functional theory (DFT) calculations."

It depends on a variety of factors, with anharmonicity and, ultimately, melting playing a pivotal role. In this work we develop a first-principles model from an analytically tractable semi-harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The resulting specific heat expression depends not only on the Einstein temperature of the material but also on other physical parameters. We compare our predictions with experimental data for copper, aluminum, lead, silicon, and germanium with rather satisfactory results, especially considering that there are no fitting parameters in our theory. We finish this work by showing that our results formally justify the otherwise purely empirical formula by Maier and Kelley, also providing its coefficients in terms of elementary physical quantities."

It is based on the hydrodynamics of active matter and allows for the changes of polarization of both bacteria and the medium. Natural light is assumed to intensify the motion of clusters with different refraction indices within the bacteria and to modify their polarization. Such motion of polarized globules causes an increase in deformations and inhomogeneous polarization distribution on the bacteria surfaces. The free energy functional is used to calculate the perturbation of the bacteria surfaces and inhomogeneous polarization distributions that may either move along the bacteria or rotate. Mechanical interaction of surface deformations with water flows or interaction of the inhomogeneous polarization with free charges causes bacteria motion in the medium. Estimates of the bacteria motion velocity in the case of the proposed mechanism are made and it corresponded to experimentally observed values."

Using armchair silicene nanoribbons as a model platform, we analyze how both quantities and their ratio depend on chemical potential at room temperature. While the Seebeck coefficient captures transport properties through the energy dependence of the electronic transmission, the DEP is directly connected to the system's electronic entropy, offering a direct thermodynamic alternative for estimating $S$. We evaluate these transport-thermodynamic properties considering diverse ribbon widths, defining metallic and semiconducting regimes. We find both quantities $S$ and $s$, are highly interconnected within the ribbon's band gap energy region, and their ratio $s/S$ converges to the elementary charge $e$ across that energy window, fulfilling the Kelvin formula $S=s/e$. On the contrary, $s/S$ is undefined for gapless ribbons in the energy window of the first transmission channel. These results establish the ratio between the DEP and the Seebeck coefficient as a reliable and complementary probe for the determination of the elementary charge, and to identify the cleanness of electronic band gaps as $s/S$ matches with $e$."

      "summary": "Melting is conventionally understood as a bulk first-order phase transition, where nucleation of the liquid phase is followed by rapid growth until the solid disappears. However, in thin crystalline films containing local heterogeneities, this process can be dramatically altered by interfacial forces. Here, we report experimental evidence of suspended melting in molecularly thin films of long-chain alkanes containing trapped liquid droplets. As temperature increases, these droplets expand and flatten, yet remain pinned within the surrounding solid layers, preventing full melting. The observed sensitivity of apparent contact angle to small temperature changes is explained by a theoretical model balancing bulk melting enthalpy and interfacial energies. This work highlights how melting in thin films can be frustrated and spatially arrested by local wetting constraints, revealing a rich interplay between phase transition dynamics, confinement, and interfacial topology. Beyond alkanes, these results suggest a generic mechanism by which melting, wetting, and film morphology conspire to locally suspend phase transitions."

Through molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and reflection electron diffraction studies, we identify an incorporation limited deposition regime that enables a 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio in the growing film leading to single phase CaMoO$_4$ formation that can be in-situ doped with Er (typically 2-100 ppm). We further show that growth on silicon substrates is single phase but polycrystalline in morphology; while growth on YSZ substrates leads to high-quality epitaxial single crystalline CaMoO$_4$ films. We perform preliminary optical and microwave characterization on the suspected $Y_1 - Z_1$ transition of 2 ppm, 200 nm epitaxial CaMoO$_4$ annealed thin films and extract an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.1(1) GHz, an optical excited state lifetime of 6.7(2) ms, a spectral diffusion-limited homogeneous linewidth of 6.7(4) MHz, and an EPR linewidth of 1.10(2) GHz."

We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2."

Using NbOCl2 monolayer with competing ferroelectric (FE) and antiferroelectric (AFE) phases as a 2D material platform, we demonstrate the emerging of intrinsic antiferroelectricity in NbOCl2 monolayer under the experimentally accessible shear strain, and new functionality associated with electric field induced AFE-to-FE phase transition. Specifically, the complex configuration space accommodating FE and AFE phases, polarization switching kinetics and finite temperature thermodynamic properties of 2D NbOCl2, are all accurately predicted by large-scale molecular dynamic (MD) simulations based on deep learning interatomic potential (DP) model. Moreover, room temperature stable antiferroelectricity with low polarization switching barrier and one-dimensional (1D) collinear polarization arrangement is predicted in shear deformed NbOCl2 monolayer. Transition from AFE to FE phase in 2D NbOCl2 can be triggered by the low critical electric field, leading to the double polarization-electric (P-E) loop with small hysteresis. A new type optoelectronic device composed of AFE-NbOCl2, enabling electric \"writing\" and nonlinear optical \"reading\" logical operation with fast operation speed and low power consumption is also proposed."

      "summary": "Active matter systems, due to their spontaneous self-propulsion ability, hold potential for future applications in healthcare and environmental sustainability. Marangoni swimmers, a type of synthetic active matter, are a common model system for understanding the underlying physics. Existing studies of the interactions of active matter with passive particles have mostly focused on the modification of the behavior of the passive particles. In contrast, we analyse here experimentally the impact on the self-propulsion of camphor-infused agarose disks (active) of their interactions with floating hollow glass microspheres (passive) within an annular channel. Two distinct regimes are observed: a steady regime with uni-directional motion of the swimmer at low packing fractions (\\phi_{\\textrm{ini}} \\lesssim 0.45) and an oscillatory regime with to-and-fro motion at higher packing fractions (\\phi_{\\textrm{ini}} \\gtrsim 0.45). In the former, the swimmer pushes nearly the entire particle raft together with it, like a towing cargo, causing a decrease in swimmer speed with increasing packing fraction due to the additional drag from the particle raft. A simplified force-balance model is finally proposed that captures the experimental trend in swimmer speed reasonably well."

      "summary": "The interaction of a suspension of rotating colloids with a periodically patterned structure is here investigated by means of continuum theoretical predictions and hydrodynamic simulations. Close to the obstacle surface, rotors circulate opposite to their inherent direction of rotation as a result of unidirectional rotational stresses, which is in agreement with a prediction of the generalised Stokes equation. The resulting stationary background flow significantly affects the system dynamics and coexists with the intrinsic active turbulent behaviour. The relative importance of either of the two contributions can be controlled with the rotor density and the obstacle size, such that the system is either dominated by stationary vortices pinned to the obstacles or vivid active turbulent dynamics. While momentum dissipation into an underlying frictional substrate damps the related flows, small values of the friction can enhance the vortex flow around an obstacle. The colloids' diffusive dynamics are governed by odd diffusive fluxes guiding the colloids around the excluded volume introduced by obstacles, such that enhanced effective diffusive transport is obtained at finite obstruction. Our results pave the way to systematically address how confinement can be employed in order to control or harness the dynamics of colloidal chiral active turbulence and how the interplay of emerging edge currents and active turbulent dynamics at varying densities can be systematically determined."

      "summary": "Active matter can consume energy to generate active forces that propel themselves and to exhibit numerous fascinating out-of-equilibrium features. The paradigmatic model, active Brownian particles, even without attractive and alignment interactions, can form a phase coexistence of low- and high-density phases. Recent researches have revealed that particles within the high-density phase move in a coordinated manner, creating either aligned or vortex-like velocity-correlation domains. However, the mechanism underlying the translation or rotation of these domains remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the velocity-correlation domains are spatially consistent with the ordered microphases. The microphases, surrounded by defects, are hexatic and differently oriented microdomains. The direction of particles' active forces at the edge of a microphase tends to point inward, creating compression that maintains this microphase. The net active force or active torque acting on the microphase causes it to translate or rotate, thereby generating the velocity-correlation domains."

This series features unprecedented layered structural motifs, rutile-based PtO$_6$ octahedra and one-dimensional PtO$_4$ square-planar columns, which enables systematic control of dimensionality. Furthermore, we demonstrate a computationally-assisted identification of isomeric and putative members of this homologous series as confirmed by controlled synthesis and quantitative analysis of diffuse scattering data.

      "summary": "Rectification of electromagnetic fields into direct current (DC) is pivotal for energy harvesting, wireless charging, and next-generation communication technologies. The superconducting diode effect, which exploits the nonreciprocal transport of dissipationless superconducting currents, offers ultra-low power consumption and high rectification ratios. Combining the superconducting diode effect with the AC Josephson effect holds promise for converting radio-frequency (rf) irradiation into a quantized DC output. However, experimental realization has been hindered by challenges in achieving the necessary symmetry breaking and fabricating high-performance Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate the quantum rectification in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, which hosts emergent Josephson effects and a zero-field Josephson diode. Under rf irradiation, a DC voltage emerges without applied bias, scaling linearly with frequency as V = hf/2e, where h is Planck's constant, f is the microwave frequency, and e is the electron charge. Furthermore, the rectified voltage exhibits quantized steps with increasing rf power, consistent with Shapiro step quantization. Our work establishes CsV3Sb5 as a versatile platform for wireless quantum power supplies and charging, and underscores the intertwined order parameters as a promising pathway for precise quantum matter control."

The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This \"train-small, generate-large\" capability establishes a new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems described by continuous fields on a lattice."

Self-assembly simulations of proteins, driven by short-range non-polar interactions, can find the biologically correct assembly as the energy minimizing state. Short-ranged potentials produce rugged energy landscapes however, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional, local minimizers. Successful self-assembly simulations depend both on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space. We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales. Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes."

We show HI binding to a monovacancy in vanadium produces a non-monotonic dependence between diffusivity and gas concentration, unlike the tungsten system. We demonstrate the difference between multiple single occupancy traps and multi-occupancy traps in long-term diffusion dynamics. The applicability of the multi-occupancy, multi-isotope model in steady state is assessed by comparison to an isotope exchange experiment between hydrogen and deuterium in self-ion irradiated tungsten.

Within this framework, we derive exact expressions for the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and time-dependent diffusivity, showing how chirality and density coupling renormalize orientational persistence and generate dynamical crossovers. The theory predicts: (i) anomalously high initial diffusivity in denser regions, arising from a transient drift driven by local swim-pressure gradients; (ii) a finite crossover time $t_c$ for homogenizing density inhomogeneities, with steady-state diffusivity retaining memory of the initial environment; (iii) a non-monotonic $t_c(\\Omega)$ with a global minimum at intermediate chirality, and a three-regime suppression of $D_\\infty(\\Omega)$ consistent with clustered phases in simulations; and (iv) a resonance-like peak in early-time oscillatory transport at an optimal chirality $\\Omega^*$.

The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions."

      "summary": "Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 40- to 600-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles before failure. These gains stem from residual stress fields generated at the interface between silica pockets and BNT bricks, which delay crack initiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both functional and structural performance are critical."

      "summary": "When a nanoribbon is bent under a homogeneous external magnetic field, the effective magnetic field inside becomes either homogeneous or inhomogeneous, depending on the direction of the field. This enables the selective creation of bulk, interface, and edge magnetic states in the bent structure, for a magnetic field with a strength. We establish theoretically that these tuneable states lead to a strong geometry-induced anisotropic magnetoconductance (GAMC) in perpendicularly bent nanoribbon, which can reach up to 100\\%. Moreover, the GAMC can be further enhanced to 200\\%, 300\\%, or even higher by either further bending or tuning the bending angle. The potential of this phenomenon for practical applications is demonstrated by its stable anisotropy, which remains consistent across a wide range of Fermi energies, can be observed even at weak magnetic fields and room temperature, and occurs in various systems such as two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and graphene."

      "summary": "The broken inversion symmetry at interfaces of complex oxides gives rise to emergent phenomena, including ferromagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which profoundly influence the electronic structure by entangling spin and momentum. While the interplay between Rashba SOC and ferromagnetism is theoretically intriguing, its experimental manifestations remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic 2DEGs at SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces exhibit spontaneous nonreciprocal transport - a distinctive hallmark of Rashba ferromagnets - even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This nonreciprocal response, along with clear signatures of ferromagnetism such as anisotropic magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), is strongly tunable by gate voltage. Remarkably, the AHE not only varies in amplitude but even reverses sign, reflecting a subtle interplay between Fermi level position and Berry curvature distribution. These results establish SrTiO$_3$ 2DEGs as a model platform for studying Rashba ferromagnetism and demonstrate active control over transport phenomena in time- and inversion-symmetry-broken systems, paving the way for gate-tunable spintronic devices."

In the infinite system limit the model exhibits a critical line, which ends at a tricritical point. Unexpectedly, the critical Casimir force (CCF) is \\textit{repulsive} near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly upon departure from those two regions and becoming \\textit{attractive}. This violates the widely-accepted ``boundary condition rule,'' which presumes that the CCF is attractive for equivalent boundary conditions (BC) and repulsive for conflicting BC. For the HF we find that it also changes sign as a function of temperature and the magnetization. We conclude, that CCF and HF have a behavior quite different from each other as a function of the tunable parameters (temperature, magnetic field, or magnetization) of the model.

We unravel the unconventional Hall response in the nonmagnetic Dirac material ZrTe5, known for its massive Dirac bands and unique electronic and transport properties. Using the Kubo-Streda formula within the Landau level framework, we explore the interplay of quantum effects induced by the magnetic field (B) and disorder across the semiclassical and quantum regimes. In the semiclassical regime, the Hall resistivity remains linear in the magnetic field, but the Hall coefficient will be renormalized by the quantum geometric effects and electron-hole coherence, especially at low carrier densities where the disorder scattering dominates. In quantum limit, the Hall conductivity exhibits an unsaturating 1/B scaling. As a result, the transverse conductivity dominates transport in the ultra-quantum limit, and the Hall resistivity crosses over from B to B^{-1} dependence as the system transitions from the semiclassical regime to the quantum limit. This work elucidates the mechanisms underlying the unconventional Hall effect in ZrTe5 and provides insights into the AHE in other nonmagnetic Dirac materials as well."

Here, we study spin-wave dynamics in M\\\"obius-shaped soft-magnetic nanostrips using micromagnetic simulations. By comparing single-, double-, and triple-twisted M\\\"obius strips to a topologically trivial bent ring, we isolate the roles of helical twist and non-orientable topology. M\\\"obius geometries exhibit non-degenerate mode doublets associated with counterpropagating spin waves, in contrast to the standing-wave doublets in the trivial case. This splitting arises from a twist-induced geometric (Berry) phase that breaks propagation symmetry, producing non-reciprocal dispersion relations. The M\\\"obius topology further imposes antisymmetric boundary conditions, resulting in half-integer wavelength quantization. Local RF excitation allows for the selective generation of spin waves with defined frequency and direction. An analytical model reproduces the dispersion behavior with excellent agreement. These results highlight how geometric and topological design can be leveraged to engineer spin-wave transport in three-dimensional magnonic systems."

      "summary": "Halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated a rapid increase in power conversion efficiencies. Understanding and mitigating remaining carrier losses in halide perovskites is now crucial to enable further increases to approach their practical efficiency limits. Whilst the most widely known non-radiative recombination from solar cells relates to carrier trapping and is first order in carrier density, recent reports have revealed a non-radiative pathway that is second order. However, the origin and impact of this second-order process on devices remain unclear. Here, we understand this non-radiative second-order recombination (k2non) pathway by manipulating the charge carrier dynamics via controlling the bulk and surface conditions. By combining temperature-dependent spectroscopies, we demonstrate that the value of k2non depends on extrinsic factors, in contrast to intrinsic second-order recombination, which aligns with theoretical evaluations through van Roosbroeck-Shockley relations. Based on density functional theory simulations and Quasi-Fermi level calculations, we propose that shallow surface states are the primary origin of this second-order non-radiative component, contributing up to ~80 mV of the overall reduction in Voc at room temperature. This work reveals that carrier losses from two non-radiative recombination types (first and second order) are not linked, emphasizing the need for distinctive mitigation strategies targeting each type to unlock the full efficiency potential of perovskite solar cells."

Despite their significant potential, the reliable electrical readout of individual skyrmions remains a fundamental challenge. While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous-Hall-effect-based techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications. Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. These advances establish a robust platform for skyrmion-based sensors, counters and unconventional computing systems that depend on precise individual skyrmion control and detection."

In this work an extensive NMR study, supported by the bulk magnetization measurements has been performed at 4.2 K on a self-organized single crystal MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te4)n heterostructure. 55Mn and 209Bi NMR signal have been recorded as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field up to 6T, covering a spin-flop transition from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) to the canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) configuration of the Mn layers. Structural defects were shown to contribute a small ferromagnetic component below the spin-flop field. Presence of the AFM-coupled Mn antisites has been evidenced and shown to induce an antiparallel magnetic moment on Bi atoms within the host Bi layer. Detection of the induced magnetic moment on bismuth which contributes a new ferromagnetic component is of utmost importance for understanding the magnetic interactions in the MBT/BT system.

The CSF energy shows a moderate decrease from 300K to about 1200 K, followed by a stronger drop. We demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the individual thermal excitations. We also propose a way to analyze the origin of the significant anharmonic contribution to the CSF energy through atomic pair distributions at the CSF plane. With the newly available high-temperature CSF data, an increasing energy barrier for the cross-slip process in Ni3Al with increasing temperature is unveiled, necessitating the refinement of existing analytical models."

      "summary": "In this work, the nonequilibrium pathways of the collapse of the helix-forming biopolymer polyalanine are investigated. To this end, the full time evolution of the helix-coil transition is simulated using molecular dynamics simulations. At the start of the transition short $3_{10}$-helices form, seemingly leading to the molecule becoming more aspherical midway through the collapse. After the completed collapse, the formation of $\\alpha$-helices seems to become the prevalent ordering mechanism leading to helical bundles, a structure representative for the equilibrium behavior of longer chains. The dynamics of this transition is explored in terms of the power-law scaling of two associated relaxation times as a function of the chain length."

      "summary": "Post-transfer in-depth morphological characterization of graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is of great importance to evaluate the quality and to understand the origin of defects of the transferred sheets. Herein, a semi-dry transfer technique is used to peel off millimeter-sized CVD graphene flakes from polycrystalline copper foils and transfer them onto SiO2/Si substrates. We take advantage of the unique feature of this semi-dry process: it preserves the copper substrate, enabling location-specific morphological comparisons between graphene and copper at various stages of the transfer. Thanks to a combination of morphological characterization techniques, this leads to trace and elucidate the origin of various post-transfer graphene defects (cracks, wrinkles, holes, tears). Specifically, thermally induced wrinkles are shown to evolve into nanoscale cracks, while copper surface steps lead to folds. Furthermore, we find that the macroscale topography of the copper foil also plays a critical role in defect formation. This work provides guidelines on how to correctly interpret the post-transfer morphology of graphene films on relevant substrates and how to properly assess their quality. This contributes to the optimization of both the graphene CVD growth and transfer processes for future applications."

      "summary": "We introduce a class of models containing robust and analytically demonstrable multifractality induced by disorder correlations. Specifically, we investigate the statistics of eigenstates of disordered tight-binding models on two classes of rooted, high-dimensional graphs -- trees and hypercubes -- with a form of strong disorder correlations we term `radial disorder'. In this model, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical, while those at different distances are independent random variables (or their analogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is also considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are used to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal states. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse participation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to a qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and typical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the multifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be underpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective one-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson localisation. The interplay between the exponential localisation of states on these chains, and the exponential growth of the number of sites with distance from the root, is the origin of the observed multifractality."

In such applications, atomic diffusion critically governs essential properties including creep resistance and microstructural stability. The present study systematically investigates impurity diffusion of Co, Mn, and Zn in single phase (BCC solid solution) HfTiZrNbTa and HfTiZrNbV RHEAs applying the radiotracer technique. A neutron total scattering technique is used to evaluate the pair distribution functions and element-specific lattice distortions in these alloys. \\textit{Ab initio}-based calculations give access to lattice distortions and solubilities of the impurities under investigation, including the impact of short-range order. The diffusion results are discussed in relation to calculated substitutional and interstitial solution energies, local lattice distortions, and short-range order effects. Co diffusion is found to be dominated by the interstitial mechanism, exhibiting fast diffusion. These findings reveal important structure-property relationships between local atomic environments and diffusion kinetics in BCC RHEAs, providing critical insights for designing alloys with enhanced high-temperature performance through targeted control of impurity diffusion processes."

Here we use a simple microswimmer model inspired by swimming biflagellates which consists of a spherical cell body and two small spherical beads representing the motion of the two flagella. Using reinforcement learning we identify for different microswimmer morphologies quasi-optimized swimming strokes. For all studied cases the identified strokes result in symmetric and quasi-synchronized beating of the two flagella beads. Interestingly, the stroke-averaged flow fields are of pusher type, and the observed swimming gaits outperform previously used biflagellate microswimmer models relying on predefined circular flagella bead motion."

      "summary": "Whether and how a system approaches equilibrium is central in nonequilibrium statistical physics, crucial to understanding thermalization and transport. Bogoliubov's three-stage (initial, kinetic, and hydrodynamic) evolution hypothesis offers a qualitative framework, but quantitative progress has focused on near-integrable systems like dilute gases. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of a one-dimensional diatomic hard-point (DHP) gas, presenting a phase diagram that characterizes relaxation behavior across the full parameter space, from near-integrable to far-from-integrable regimes. We analyze thermalization (local energy relaxation in nonequilibrium states) and identify three universal dynamical regimes: (i) In the near-integrable regime, kinetic processes dominate, local energy relaxation decays exponentially, and the thermalization time $\\tau$ scales as $\\tau \\propto \\delta^{-2}$. (ii) In the far-from-integrable regime, hydrodynamic effects dominate, energy relaxation decays power-law, and thermalization time scales linearly with system size $N$. (iii) In the intermediate regime, the Bogoliubov phase emerges, characterized by the transition from kinetic to hydrodynamic relaxation. The phase diagram also shows that hydrodynamic behavior can emerge in small systems when sufficiently far from the integrable regime, challenging the view that such effects occur only in large systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the system's relaxation depends on the order in which the limits ($N \\to \\infty$ or $\\delta \\to 0$) are taken. We then analyze heat transport (decay of heat-current fluctuations in equilibrium), demonstrating its consistency with thermalization, leading to a unified theoretical description of thermalization and transport. Our approach provides a pathway for studying relaxation dynamics in many-body systems, including quantum systems."

Among various strategies to create porous gels, polymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS) has shown particular promise. However, the conditions that trigger and control PIPS remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of solvent quality, polymeric precursor molecular weight, and polymer concentration on phase separation in polymerizing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate gels. We find that phase separation occurs when the precursor solution concentration is below the overlap concentration. Phase-separated gels have a pore geometry that is controlled by solvent quality: better solvents result in smaller pores, while worse solvents can create superporous, highly-absorbant gels. Motivated by our results, we propose a theory that predicts when phase separation occurs in polymerizing gels, applicable across a wide range of polymer/solvent gel systems. Our results provide a framework for the rational design of porous gels."

However, their effective impact on material behavior remains elusive, as condensed matter studies struggle to capture their intricate interplay with atomic defects in the crystal. In this work, we present an automated workflow for modeling polarons within density functional theory (DFT). Our approach enables a fully automatic identification of the most favorable polaronic configurations in the system. Machine learning techniques accelerate predictions, allowing for an efficient exploration of the defect-polaron configuration space. We apply this methodology to Nb-doped TiO$_2$(110) surfaces, providing new insights into the role of defects in surface reactivity. Using CO adsorbates as a probe, we find that Nb doping has minimal impact on reactivity, whereas oxygen vacancies contribute significantly depending on their local arrangement via the stabilization of polarons on the surface atomic layer. Our package streamlines the modeling of charge trapping and polaron localization with high efficiency, enabling systematic, large-scale investigations of polaronic effects across complex material systems."

The transmission properties leading to this optimal performance are identified. We showcase our findings with the example of a refrigerator exploiting experimentally relevant nonthermal resources, which could result from competing environments or from light irradiation.

      "summary": "Molecular modeling of thermally activated chemistry in condensed phases is essential to understand polymerization, depolymerization, and other processing steps of molecular materials. Current methods typically combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe short-time relaxation with a stochastic description of predetermined chemical reactions. Possible reactions are often selected on the basis of geometric criteria, such as a capture distance between reactive atoms. Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local, molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials"

However, further improvements in mechanical properties remain untapped, as alloy design has historically focused on systems with specific CrCoNi- or FeCoCrNi-based FCC matrix and Ni3Al L12 phase compositions. This study introduces novel Co-Ni-Mo-Al alloys with L12 precipitates by systematically altering Al content, aiming to bridge this research gap by revealing the strengthening mechanisms. The (CoNi)81Mo12Al7 alloy achieves yield strength of 1086 MPa, tensile strength of 1520 MPa, and ductility of 35 %, demonstrating an impressive synergy of strength, ductility, and strain-hardening capacity. Dislocation analysis via transmission electron microscopy, supported by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations using density functional theory (DFT), demonstrates that Mo substitution for Al in the L12 phase alters dislocation behavior, promoting the formation of multiple deformation modes, including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains. These behaviors are facilitated by the low stacking fault energy (SFE) of the FCC matrix, overlapping of SFs, and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase boundaries (APBs). The increased energy barrier for superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) formation compared to APBs, due to Mo substitution, further influences dislocation activity. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for designing high-performance M/HEAs by expanding the range of FCC matrix and L12 compositions through precipitation hardening."

This externally imposed modulation leads to a reconstructed multi-band structure with flat bands emerging in certain energy regions. When the chemical potential is tuned into one of these flat bands, the associated increase in the density of states can strongly enhance the superconducting critical temperature Tc compared to the homogeneous case while maintaining the superfluid stiffness Ds at a sizeable value. We also clarify the role of the quantum geometric effect for flat bands in such topologically trivial systems. While the overall paramagnetic interband contribution to the stiffness is negative we identify a class of certain interband scattering processes which enhance Ds and scale with the interaction, playing therefore the same role as quantum geometric effects in conventional flat band models. The enhancement of superconductivity is found to be robust against weak to moderate disorder, suggesting that the system is not overly sensitive to imperfections which is an important prerequisite for experimental realizations. Our results demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a compelling alternative to twist-based moire systems, providing a pathway toward tailoring superconductivity via lithographic design."

In ABX3 halide perovskites, localized and often aspherical local electron densities from B-site lone pairs or polarizable X- anions can distort the lattice. However, the links among electronic structure fluctuations and distortions like tilting of the BX6 octahedra and off-centering of the B-site from the center of its octahedron are not fully understood. Using group theory and ab initio molecular dynamics, we quantify how lone pairs, halide polarization, off-centering, and octahedral tilting interact in the cubic phase CsBBr3, with B = Pb, Sn, and Ge. We find that lone pair-induced off-centering and octahedral tilting are symmetry-decoupled. Instead, stereochemical lone pair expression of the B-site ion is correlated to octahedral tilting through the propensity of the B-site to form a transient, partial covalent bond with the surrounding halide ions that stiffens octahedral tilting modes. These results link local electronic asymmetry to structural fluctuations and suggest that dynamic modulation of electronic symmetry offers a pathway to control functional properties in halide perovskites."

Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01-0.02 angstrom and errors in the energy below 10~meV/atom across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal machine learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces."

      "summary": "Understanding the structural origins of glass formation and mechanical response remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Recent studies have identified the local caging potential experienced by a particle due to its nearest neighbors as a robust structural metric that links microscopic structure to dynamics under thermal fluctuations and applied shear. However, its connection to locally favored structural motifs has remained unclear. Here, we analyze structural motifs in colloidal crystals and glasses and correlate them with the local caging potential. We find that icosahedral motifs in glasses are associated with deeper caging potentials than crystalline motifs such as face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures. Both crystalline and amorphous systems also contain large number of particles belonging to stable defective motifs, which are distortions of the regular motifs. Under shear, large clusters of defective motifs fragment into smaller ones, driving plastic deformation and the transition from a solid-like to a liquid-like state in amorphous suspensions. Particles that leave clusters of stable motifs are associated with shallower caging potentials and are more prone to plastic rearrangements, ultimately leading to motif disintegration during shear. Our results thus reveal that the loss of mechanical stability in amorphous suspensions is governed by the topological evolution of polytetrahedral motifs, uncovering a structural mechanism underlying plastic deformation and fluidization."

      "summary": "We propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to directly measure energy dissipation for a linearly driven superfluid confined in a harmonic trap. The method relies on a perturbed version of the harmonic-potential theorem, according to which a potential perturbation - effectively acting as a stirrer - converts center-of-mass motional energy into internal energy. Energy conservation then enables a direct, quantitative determination of the dissipated energy from measurements of the macroscopic center-of-mass observables. Applying this method to a perturbed, driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe dissipation curves characteristic of superfluid flow, including a critical velocity that depends on the stirrer strength, consistent with previous studies. Our results are supported by mean-field simulations, which corroborate both the theoretical framework and the experimental findings."

      "summary": "Over the last decade, high-harmonic spectroscopy has been successfully extended to the study of ultrafast electron motion in solids, shedding light on fundamental processes such as Bloch oscillations and higher-order nonlinear phenomena. In this work, we present theoretical studies of high-harmonic spectroscopy applied to topological materials including higher-order ones, focusing on several key observables associated with high-harmonic generation - namely, helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity dependence. We extend current all-optical measurement approaches from lower-order topological insulators (LOTIs) to higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), employing three distinct models: a Haldane model for Chern insulators, Kane-Mele model for topological insulators, and a breathing Kagome lattice for HOTIs. This work aims to resolve whether helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity dependence can reveal signatures of topological states. For the Chern insulators and topological insulators, we find that these observables can indeed capture topological phases. In contrast, for HOTIs, no clear signatures of topology emerge in the harmonic spectrum, suggesting that a more careful analysis is required to identify topological invariants in higher-order topological insulators. In particular, for the topological semimetal phase, we find a harmonic enhancement by two to three orders of magnitude in the Kagome lattice. Our study delineates the conditions under which high-harmonic spectroscopy serves as a unique tool for diagnosing topological phases, particularly for those associated with topological corner states."

Specifically, we vary the encapsulation conditions and doping of graphenes, seeking to identify SHG \"fingerprints\" that are unsensitive to external perturbations. We identify characteristic features in the infrared regime that may be used as a stacking-order fingerprint for the mixed stacking tetralayer and the trilayer polytypes caused by a strong double resonance effect. Further to this, we find that the tetralayers systematically produce an SHG response that is significantly larger as compared to the trilayers. We then studied the SHG signal by the tetralayer polytypes in the terahertz regime and demonstrated the signal is highly sensitive the environmental conditions. Furthermore, we also find that accidental doping of graphene will strongly suppress the SHG signal in this regime. The above findings emphasize the need for a spectral approach to the identification of stacking order by SHG. Thus, measurements at one frequency are insufficient to confidently identify the stacking order due to the environmental sensitivities, since SHG can be readily induced with a comparable magnitude in the centrosymmetric polytypes through external symmetry-breaking."

In this work, we extend the theoretical framework of altermagnetism to quasicrystals (QCs), which lack translational symmetry. We classify magnetic phases in 2D QCs with $n$-fold rotational symmetry without spin-orbit coupling, by using the irreducible representation (IRRP) of the $D_n$ point group. Based on symmetry analysis, we propose the conjecture that magnetic phases corresponding to 1D non-identity IRRPs are generally altermagnetic, with the exception of those possessing parity-time symmetry. To verify our conjecture, we take the Hubbard model as an example and develop a systematic approach to determine the magnetic pattern in the QC, which effectively avoids getting trapped at local energy minima. Consequently, our tests for the Hubbard model on various QCs with different symmetries are unexceptionally consistent with our proposal. Our work highlights the QC as a platform where the altermagnetism is common among magnetic phases."

Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between the N\\'eel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles, the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones. The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge conductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$ channels. These findings highlight altermagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions as a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure."

We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

BW-s2 achieves high accuracy for cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli in metals, semiconductors, and molecular crystals, rivaling or surpassing coupled-cluster with singles and doubles at lower cost. In rare gas solids, where MP2 already underbinds, $\\kappa$-MP2 does not make the results much worse while BW-s2 struggles. These results illustrate both the potential and the limitations of regularized perturbation theory for efficient and accurate solid-state simulations. While broader testing is warranted, BW-s2($\\alpha$ = 2) appears particularly promising, with possible advantages over modern random-phase approximations and coupled-cluster theory."

While 2D melting in skyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in skyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform energy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions in thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be directly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their dynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce geometric confinements of varying shapes. Combining Kerr microscopy experiments with Thiele model simulations, we demonstrate that confinement geometry critically influences lattice order. Specifically, hexagonal confinements commensurate with the skyrmion lattice stabilize monodomain hexagonal ordering, while incommensurate geometries induce domain formation and reduce overall order. Understanding these boundary-driven effects is essential for advancing the study of 2D phase behavior and for the design of skyrmion-based spintronic applications, ranging from memory devices to unconventional computing architectures."

To bridge this gap, we here develop a bottom-up physical model that explicitly incorporates these two fundamental cell-level drivers of protein aggregation dynamics. We show that our model naturally explains the characteristic long, slow development of pathology followed by a rapid acceleration, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the model reveals the existence of a critical switch point at which the system's dynamics transition from being dominated by slow, spontaneous formation of diseased cells to being driven by fast propagation. This framework provides a robust physical foundation for interpreting pathological data and offers a method to predict which class of therapeutic strategies is best matched to the underlying drivers of a specific disease."

Here we perform the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the case of small systems at finite temperature using the complex Langevin method (CLM), which has been successfully applied to various interesting systems with the sign problem over the decade. In particular, we show the existence of a parameter region in which the validity criterion for the CLM is satisfied and the expectation value of the energy obtained by exact diagonalization is correctly reproduced.

While B doping introduced impurity states near the Fermi level that limited thermoelectric charge transport, $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ photoelectrodes doped by other elements exhibited notable improvements, including enhanced visible-light absorption, increased carrier concentration, improved electrical conductivity ($\\sigma$), and efficient thermal management. Additionally, these doped photoelectrodes exhibited a remarkable increase in Pauli magnetic susceptibility ($\\chi$) by two orders of magnitude compared to pristine $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, indicating exciting potential for generating spin-selective polarized currents. Overall, our findings revealed that the co-doping conditions are the most effective for enhancing the performance of $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, providing a low-cost and high-efficiency solution for sustainable green hydrogen (H$_2$) generation in photocatalytic water splitting."

In this work, we demonstrate the junction-embedded resonator (JER) as a platform which enables us to identify and quantify various dissipation mechanisms of JJ. JER is constructed by embedding JJ in the middle of an open-circuit, 1/2 {\\lambda} transmission-line resonator. When the 1st and 2nd harmonics of JER are excited, JJ experiences different boundary conditions, and is dominated by internal and external dissipations, respectively. We systematically study these 2 dissipation mechanisms of JJ by varying the JJ area and number. Our results unveil the completely different behaviors of these 2 dissipation mechanisms, and quantitatively characterize their contributions, shedding a light on the direction of JJ optimization in various applications."

      "summary": "The preparation of long-range entangled (LRE) states via quantum measurements is a promising strategy, yet its stability against realistic, non-commuting measurement noise remains a critical open question. Here, we systematically investigate the rich phase structure emerging from a minimal model of competing, non-commuting weak measurements: nearest-neighbor Ising ($Z_iZ_j$) and single-qubit transverse ($X_i$) operators. We analyze three experimentally relevant scenarios based on which measurement outcomes are read out: complete readout, no readout, and partial readout. Using a replica mean-field theory for higher dimensions, complemented by numerical simulations in one dimension, we derive the complete finite-time and stationary phase diagrams. Our analysis reveals a striking dependence on the readout protocol. Complete readout yields a direct transition between a short-range entangled (SRE) phase and a pure LRE phase. No readout (pure decoherence) precludes entanglement but exhibits a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) transition into a classically ordered mixed state. Most intriguingly, partial readout interpolates between these limits, featuring a mixed-state phase transition where the system can become trapped in the SWSSB phase or, for weaker non-commutativity, undergo successive symmetry breaking to reach a mixed LRE phase. A novel technical contribution is the use of a channel-fidelity-based partition function that allows us to simultaneously characterize both entanglement and SWSSB order, revealing a deep interplay between them in the replica limit. These results provide a cohesive picture for understanding measurement phase transitions, SWSSB, and mixed-state phase transitions, offering crucial insights for designing robust state preparation protocols on noisy quantum devices."

      "summary": "Due to their low density and large specific surface area, metal foams are increasingly used as cellular materials that combine excellent structural and thermal properties. Their cellular structure makes them particularly suitable for use in heat exchangers, insulation, and fire protection layers. The heat transport that takes place within them is a complex phenomenon characterized by the simultaneous presence of heat conduction, heat transfer, and heat radiation, making their modeling a significant challenge. The aim of the research is to develop a one-dimensional, time-dependent, discrete numerical model capable of describing the effective thermal behavior of metal foams. The model takes into account heat conduction through the solid phase, conductive heat transfer in the closed cavities, thermal radiation between the pore walls, and by-passing heat conduction around the cavity. The results highlight that geometric features such as cavity size and arrangement have a significant impact on temperature distribution and confirm that classical Fourier-based models are not accurately applicable to porous materials, but the Guyer--Krumhansl equation is an adequate candidate. Furthermore, we correlated the static and dynamic thermal diffusivity with the metal foam parameters, showing a significant sensitivity to the cavity thermal attributes."

      "summary": "Deterministically tailoring optical Fock states beyond the single-photon level is crucial for boson sampling, loss-tolerant photonic qubits, and quantum-enhanced sensing, however has yet remained elusive. Here, we report an all-linear-optical protocol that converts a resonantly driven single-photon emitter into a deterministic generator of vacuum--single-photon--two-photon states. A phase-stabilized, path-unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer combines vacuum--single-photon interference and Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, providing two knobs to shape photon-number probabilities. By tuning these knobs, we observe a dynamic transition from antibunching to strong bunching in correlation measurements. A fully quantum-mechanical, discrete time-bin model maps these results onto the tailored photon statistics. The same framework predicts that two indistinguishable emitters would extend the accessible space to deterministic NOON states and single-photon filtering. This protocol relying on linear optics and available single-photon sources provides a scalable, chip-compatible, and platform-independent route to on-demand and deterministic few-photon resources for quantum metrology, photonic computing, as well as long-distance quantum networks."

      "summary": "The inherently weak nonlinear optical response of bulk materials remains a fundamental limitation in advancing photonic technologies. Nanophotonics addresses this challenge by tailoring the size and morphology of nanostructures to manipulate the optical near field, thus modulating the nonlinear response. Here, we explore a complementary strategy based on engineering the electronic band structure in the mesoscopic regime to enhance optical nonlinearities. Specifically, we demonstrate an increase in second-harmonic generation (SHG) from crystalline silver films as their thickness is reduced down to just a few atomic monolayers. Operating at the boundary between bulk and two-dimensional systems, these ultra-thin films exhibit a pronounced enhancement of SHG with decreasing thickness. This enhancement stems from quantum confinement effects that modify the interaction between electronic states and incident light, which we explain based on quantum-mechanical calculation. Our atomically-thin crystalline silver films provide a new means to overcome the small interaction volumes inherent to nanophotonic platforms, enabling efficient nanoscale nonlinear optics with potential applications in photonics, sensing, and quantum technologies."

We then numerically demonstrate that this bound can be attained already at finite $N$ using experimentally accessible strategies: continuous photodetection and, in particular, continuous homodyne detection. Moving towards realistic implementations, we derive the fundamental precision limits for inefficient detection ($\\eta<1$). While inefficiencies asymptotically restore SQL scaling, a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible, diverging as $\\eta\\!\\to\\!1$. Numerical simulations show that homodyne detection outperforms photodetection in approaching the ultimate bound and consistently provides a collective advantage over independent single-qubit protocols, which grows with $N$."

Mapping biological computation onto architectures familiar to computer science remains an outstanding challenge. Here, inspired by Crick's proposal for molecular memory, we analyse a thermodynamically-consistent model of a protein complex subject to driven, nonequilibrium enzymatic reactions. In the strongly driven limit, we find that the system maps onto a stochastic, asynchronous variant of cellular automata, where each rule corresponds to a different set of enzymes being present. We find a broad class of phenomena in these 'molecular automata' that can be exploited for molecular computation, including error-tolerant memory via multistable attractors, and long transients that can be used as molecular stopwatches. By systematically enumerating all possible dynamical rules, we identify those that allow molecular automata to implement simple computational architectures such as finite-state machines. Overall, our results provide a framework for engineering synthetic molecular automata, and offer a route to building protein-based computation in living cells."

This study investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval, or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval. The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices, resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community, is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic community and industry."

Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems, swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that this results from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, our estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production."

While typical multireference diagnostics compare some derived property of the solution with the ideal picture of a single determinant, we try to answer a more practical question, how far is the solution from the exact one. Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to provide an approximate FCI solution for the self-consistently determined relevant active space, we compare the low-level CI expansions and one-body reduced density matrixes to determine the distance of the two solutions ($\\tilde{d}_\\Phi$, $\\tilde{d}_\\gamma$). We demonstrate the applicability of the approach for the CCSD method by benchmarking on the W4-17 dataset, as well as on transition metal-containing species. We also show that the presented moderate-cost, purely wavefunction-based metric is truly unique in the sense that it does not correlate with any popular multireference measures. We also explored the usage of CCSD natural orbitals ($\\tilde{d}_{\\gamma,\\mathrm{NO}}$) and its effect on the active space size and the metric. The proposed diagnostic can also be applied to other wavefunction approximations, and it has the potential to provide a quality measure for post-Hartree-Fock procedures in general."

Interestingly, we find that in the attractive (repulsive) van der Waals potential case, the short-range interaction can be effectively modeled by an infinite square barrier (finite square well), which leads to narrow and dense (broad and sparse) resonance structures in the quantum defect parameter. In the quasi-2D attractive case, shape resonances can appear in an ordered fashion across different partial waves, characterized by sharp phase jumps as the scattering energy is varied. Furthermore, the low-energy analytical expansions derived from QDT show excellent agreement with the exact numerical results, validating the accuracy and usefulness of our analytical approach in describing two-body physics governed by long-range van der Waals interactions."

      "summary": "Quantum confinement of surface electrons in two-dimensional metal-organic porous networks offers a powerful route to engineer electronic states for emerging quantum and spintronic technologies at the molecular scale. To date, such confinement has been understood primarily in terms of lateral, two-dimensional surface potential landscapes. Here, we demonstrate the pivotal role of vertical variations in the surface potential on the quantum confinement of surface electrons. We investigate the confinement behavior of both Shockley surface state and image potential state electrons with their distinct vertical electron density distributions in an exemplary Cu-T4PT metal-organic porous network on Cu(111). Advanced spectroscopic techniques reveal a substantial band renormalization for the image state electrons, manifested as a significant increase in their effective mass, whereas the Shockley state electrons remain almost unchanged. Such striking divergence is attributed to the distinct three-dimensional potential landscape of the Cu-T4PT network with a strong repulsive potential at the vertical position of the molecular backbone and leaky channels underneath the Cu coordination spheres. Our findings demonstrate the essential role of vertical potential engineering in designing quantum confined states and thus advance the control of electronic properties and quantum phenomena on the nanoscale."

In this study, we report fundamental experimental evidence of the altermagnetic nature of hematite ($\\alpha$-\\ch{Fe2O3}), combining electrical transport with advanced XPEEM imaging with linear and circular dichroism contrast. Our measurements directly visualize the N\\'eel vector's coupling to the crystal orientation, confirming hematite's altermagnetic order and its symmetry-driven transport behavior. Transport measurements reveal an anisotropic AHE with a pronounced crystal orientation dependence, including a sign inversion for specific N\\'eel vector alignments. Supported by first-principles theoretical calculations, we explain how the interplay between collinear spin and crystal symmetry breaking drives the observed anomalous Hall effect. These findings establish hematite as an altermagnet, paving the way for experimental identification of altermagnetic materials and their integration into spintronic technologies."

      "summary": "Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for shell models. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, by assuming the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the Kolmogorov multiplier, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade."

      "summary": "Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from the environment. At the same time, a finite degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Therefore, detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. While various platforms enabled single-shot readout of nuclear spins, their direct environments were either unknown or impossible to controllably modify on the atomic scale. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its lifetime to be in the order of seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on the pumping and relaxation mechanisms of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and tunnelling current, which is supported by model calculations. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically assembled qubit platforms."

However, the compositional design space is immense. Exhaustively mapping this space with conventional CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) is impractical because database coverage and run times scale poorly with millions of candidate chemistries. To address this, we train a deep-learning surrogate on CALPHAD outputs that preserves the thermodynamic fidelity while accelerating temperature-dependent phase-fraction predictions of RMPEA phases. The model achieves high accuracy in predicting phase fractions for up to eight distinct phases across different temperatures and offers a speedup of two orders of magnitude compared to CALPHAD. Using this model, we screen the Ti, Fe, Al, V, Ni, Nb and Zr elemental space for potentially stable single-phase BCC alloys at different annealing temperatures and extract design insights to guide the synthesis of new BCC RMPEAs in experiments. Finally, we develop an analytical model that enables rapid, interpretable identification of single-phase BCC RMPEAs."

These microscopic, hair-like appendages exhibit asymmetric beating patterns that break time-reversal symmetry needed to facilitate fluid transport at the cellular level. The intrinsic anisotropies in ciliary structure can promote preferential beating directions, further influencing their dynamics. In this study, we employ numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of a filament driven by a follower force at its tip to explore how intrinsic curvature and direction-dependent bending stiffnesses impact filament dynamics. Our results show that while intrinsic curvature is indeed able to induce asymmetric beating patterns when filament motion is restricted to a plane, this beating is unstable to out of plane perturbations. Furthermore, we find that a 3D whirling state seen for isotropic filament dynamics can be suppressed when sufficient asymmetry or anisotropy are introduced. Finally, for bending stiffness ratios as low as 2, we demonstrate that combining structural anisotropy with intrinsic curvature can stabilise asymmetric beating patterns, highlighting the crucial role of anisotropy in ciliary dynamics."

Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we uncover a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs. inter-band contributions. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space in gapped systems with both linear dispersion, such as for massive Dirac Fermions, and with quadratic dispersion, as e.g. for bilayer graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon increasing dephasing, destructive interference between intra- and inter-band contributions is lifted. This leads to reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics, i.e. a crossover from the characteristic spectral \"shoulder\" to a slowly decaying signal involving much higher harmonics."

Using supervised machine learning, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions. Additionally, we conduct a regression task to predict superfluid density, which reflects non-local properties of the quantum system, and achieve good accuracy. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Finally, using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the machine learning models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data.

So far, the highly desirable electrical control of the JD effect has not been demonstrated in any JTJ prepared by techniques used in semiconductor industry. We report the fabrication of JTJs featuring a composite tunnel barrier of Al$_2$O$_3$ and Hf$_{\\mathrm{0.8}}$Zr$_\\mathrm{0.2}$O$_2$ prepared by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). These JTJs were found to show the JD effect in nominally zero magnetic fields with the nonreciprocity controllable using an electric training current, yielding a surprisingly large diode efficiency not achieved previously. The quasiparticle tunneling, through which the Josephson coupling in a JTJ is established, was found to show no nonreciprocity. We attribute these observations to the simultaneous presence of positive and negative Josephson couplings, with the latter originating from indirect tunneling. The resulted spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and the double-minima washboard potential for the ensemble averaged phase difference in the resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model are shown to fully account for the experimentally observed JD effect."

      "summary": "The vibrational dynamics of adsorbate molecules in single-molecule junctions depend critically on the geometric structure and electronic interactions between molecule and substrate. Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by external stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy dissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes, and the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular manipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning probe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle adsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density functional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule junction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation experiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the interplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon relaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively depend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive effect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling enhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with infrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline how our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments."

Within classical kinetics of 2D electrons, such correlations are described as subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons, temporarily joined in pairs. Corresponding correlation-induced retarded terms in the fluid dynamic equations can be described for slow flows as the dependence of the electron fluid viscosity on the flow velocity gradient, that is Non-Newtonian behavior of the fluid. We analytically calculate flow profiles in long samples in a stationary highly non-linear regime and the corresponding magnetoresistance. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic non-monotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on non-linear magnetotransport of high-purity GaAs quantum wells; we conclude that our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance."

Recent progress in trap anisotropy control under rapid rotation has renewed interest in ultracold atomic FQH physics, enabling experiments that impart much larger angular momentum per particle and offer in-situ imaging with resolution finer than the cyclotron orbit size. In this paper, we present a theoretical investigation of a rapidly rotating anisotropic Bose gas. By projecting the full Hamiltonian, including both kinetic and interaction terms, onto the lowest Landau level, we derive a compact two-parameter model that captures the effects of interaction strength, rotation rate, and anisotropy. Using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group, we obtain a phase diagram that features broken-symmetry phases and topologically ordered quantum Hall states, while also highlighting the distinctive physics arising from the system's edges. Our results demonstrate the potential for future theoretical and experimental exploration of anisotropic quantum fluids, offering a unified framework for weakly interacting Bose condensates, vortex matter, and strongly correlated topological phases."

Although characterizing the CDW phase is essential for understanding and modeling these exotic phenomena, its nature remains unresolved. In this work, we employ first-principles free-energy calculations, accounting for both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results uncover that the CDW ground state is formed by reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers in a triangular hexagonal pattern, featuring energetically degenerate different stacking orders. This accounts for the various out-of-plane modulations observed experimentally and supports the coexistence of multiple domains. The discovered symmetry-broken ground state is consistent with the absence of any electronic anisotropy in transport experiments. By combining anharmonic phonons with the calculation of electron-phonon matrix elements, we predict a superconducting critical temperature for the CDW phase in agreement with experiments, showing that superconductivity is phonon mediated. These findings not only resolve a long-standing structural puzzle, but also clarify the impact of the CDW in superconductivity, highlighting its fundamental importance in shaping the low-temperature quantum phase diagram of Kagome metals."

      "summary": "Understanding the flow behaviors of supercooled liquids presents a major challenge in liquid-state physics due to the strong nonlinearity and rich phenomena. To unravel this complexity, we introduce the concept of local configurational relaxation time $\\tau_\\rm{LC}$, which allows us to embody the solid-liquid duality, proposed by Maxwell for phenomenologically describing materials' response to external load, at the particle level. The spatial distribution of $\\tau_\\rm{LC}$ in flow is heterogeneous. Depending on the comparison between the local mobility measured by $\\tau_\\rm{LC}$ and the external shear rate, the shear response of local regions is either solid-like or liquid-like. In this way, $\\tau_\\rm{LC}$ plays a role similar to the Maxwell time. By applying this microscopic solid-liquid duality to different conditions of shear flow with a wide range of shear rates, we describe the emergence of shear thinning in steady shear, and predict the major characteristics of the transient response to start-up shear. Furthermore, we reveal a clear structural foundation for $\\tau_\\rm{LC}$ and the solid-liquid duality associated with it by introducing an order parameter extracted from local configuration. Thus, we establish a framework that connects microscopic structure, dynamics, local mechanical response, and flow behaviors for supercooled liquids. Finally, we rationalize our framework in terms of activations from energy basins that are facilitated by shear. This model illustrates how local structure, convection and thermal activation collectively determine $\\tau_\\rm{LC}$. Notably, it predicts two distinct response groups, which well correspond to the microscopic solid-liquid duality."

      "summary": "Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li$^+$). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr$_{14}$][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x$_{LiTFSI}$ $\\le$ 0.3. We find that the charge-charge and density-density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI doped [pyr$_{14}$][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density-density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x$_{LiTFSI}$-sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems."

To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field, as a finite-wavevector extension of the Green--Kubo formula.

However, most imaging demonstrations thus far have relied on costly, millimeter-sized bulk diamond substrates, which cannot be easily scaled or integrated with other materials. Here, we report a scalable method for fabricating NV-containing dense and homogenous fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) layers through electrostatic self-assembly and demonstrate the utility of the FND layers for magnetic imaging. We investigate the effect of FND concentration in suspension, substrate immersion time, and solvent pH on the FND density on the substrate. We identify optimized self-assembly conditions that maximize the FND density while minimizing aggregation. Using FND layers on a quartz substrate, we demonstrate magnetic field and magnetic noise imaging at the microscale, based on NV optically detected magnetic resonance magnetometry and T$_1$ relaxometry, respectively. Our results provide a direction for the development of cost-effective and scalable FND layers and surface coatings. This paves the way for on-demand quantum sensing and imaging on a broad range of surfaces based on NV centers and other diamond quantum emitters."

Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably, the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics."

      "summary": "Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \\(G^*\\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \\(G^*\\) for \\(\\omega\\lambda \\alt 1\\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \\(G^*\\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \\(\\omega \\approx \\tau_{s}^{-1}=\\eta_{s}/\\rho_{f}a^{2}\\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\\(t \\ll \\tau_{s}\\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \\(G^*\\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions."

      "summary": "Halide vacancies are the dominant point defects in perovskites with VCl identified as a detrimental trap for the optoelectronic performance of CsPbCl3, with applications ranging from photodetectors to solar cells. Understanding these defects under operating conditions is key since their electronic levels exhibit large thermal fluctuations that challenge the validity of static 0 K models. However, quantitative modelling of defect processes requires hybrid density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling, which is too expensive for direct molecular dynamic simulations. To address this, we train a multi-task machine learning force field to study VCl in orthorhombic CsPbCl3 at 300 K. While we observe strong oscillations in the optical transition level arising from the soft potential energy surface, neither the non-radiative capture barriers nor the thermodynamic charge transition levels are affected. Our results reveal that VCl is not responsible for the non-radiative losses previously assumed. Instead, its impact on performance arises from other mechanisms, such as limiting the open-circuit voltage and promoting ionic migration. Our findings demonstrate that, despite strong dynamical effects in halide perovskites, the conventional static formalism of defect theory remains valid for predicting thermodynamic behavior, providing a sound basis for the design of high-performance energy materials."

After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion."

We observe that this link invariant is the properly regularized Wilson line observable of abelian Chern-Simons theory, and show, in consequence of the main theorem, that this arises equivalently as the expectation value of pure quantum states on the group algebra, under link sum, of cobordism classes of framed links. Observing that these quantum states regard framed links as worldlines of anyons in that they assign a fixed complex phase factor to each crossing (braiding) of strands, we close with an outlook on implications for the identification of anyonic solitons in 2D electron gases as exotic flux quantized in Cohomotopy instead of in ordinary cohomology."

The resulting generators have matrix elements that match CFT predictions with accuracy varying from sub-percent level for the lowest-lying states up to several percent accuracy for states with dimension $\\sim 5$ with $N=16$ fermions. We show that the generators can be used to accurately identify primary operators vs descendant operators in energy ranges where the spectrum is too dense to do the identification solely based on the approximate integer spacing within conformal multiplets."

Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parameterized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed in [Stokes et al., Quantum 4, 269 (2020)], by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix-the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices-for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state."

In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set."

To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ``dressed invasion fitness'', which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics."

Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The Wilczek-Zee (WZ) holonomy arises in degenerate states while the Uhlmann holonomy characterizes finite-temperature topology. We investigate possible relationships between the Uhlmann phase and the scalar WZ phase, which reflects the Uhlmann and WZ holonomy respectively, in an exemplary four-level model with two doubly degenerate subspaces. Through exact solutions, we contrast the behavior of the Uhlmann and WZ connections and their associated phases. In the zero-temperature limit, the Uhlmann phase may or may not agree with the scalar WZ phase of the degenerate ground states due to obstructions from the Hamiltonian manifested as Dirac points. This is in stark contrast to non-degenerate systems where the correspondence between the Uhlmann and Berry phases in general holds. Our analyses further show that for the example studied here, the Uhlmann phase catches the singular behavior at the Dirac points while the WZ connection and scalar WZ phase vanish along a zero-field axis. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets\" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior."

The hyperfine structure of reactive ligands of these clusters can be studied experimentally and theoretically by means of hyperfine spectroscopy, which can reveal catalytic intermediates in these biochemical processes. Their theoretical prediction, however, requires either advanced methods that describe strongly correlated systems, or Hamiltonian modeling based on symmetry-broken electronic structure methods. This work shows that the addition of electron-transfer interactions to the Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck Hamiltonian model leads to the quantitative explanation of hyperfine coupling constants at active organic ligand sites. Comparison with experimentally available results confirms our extended approach can be used in calculations aimed at describing cutting-edge systems."

The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science."
