      "summary": "The authors show here that the scalar spin chirality (SSC) can be thermally induced in magnets where ground states have zero SSC. The results are obtained for 2D ferromagnets on kagome and honeycomb lattices, where Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions break effective time-reversal symmetry for magnons, yielding finite SSC at nonzero temperatures that can reach magnitudes comparable to those of noncoplanar spin structures under certain situations. These results reveal a significant manifestation of SSC in collinear spin systems, providing new insights into chiral magnetism. [Phys. Rev. B 112, 104440] Published Thu Sep 25, 2025"
