The common assumption is that stronger magnets always improve SNR t , without fully accounting for constraints on the specific absorption rate (SAR). This study analyzes how SNR t scales with magnetic field strength under realistic SAR limits. Surprisingly, for a given pulse sequence there exists an optimal field that maximizes SNR t . This insight should improve clinical MRS by prioritizing the “just right” field strength and SAR-aware pulse timing to achieve truly time-efficient spectroscopy. [Phys. Rev.
