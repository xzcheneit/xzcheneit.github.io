The authors solve this puzzle here using topologically trivial Al–InSb nanosheet junctions, showing the missing step comes from a measurement blind region caused by sharp superconducting switching jumps. Tuning temperature, magnetic field, microwave power, or frequency restores the step when jumps are softened or lowered, identifying that there exists a ubiquitous non-topological origin. [Phys. Rev.

The common assumption is that stronger magnets always improve SNR t , without fully accounting for constraints on the specific absorption rate (SAR). This study analyzes how SNR t scales with magnetic field strength under realistic SAR limits. Surprisingly, for a given pulse sequence there exists an optimal field that maximizes SNR t . This insight should improve clinical MRS by prioritizing the “just right” field strength and SAR-aware pulse timing to achieve truly time-efficient spectroscopy. [Phys. Rev.

The results show that valence fluctuations stem from the degeneracy of the 5 f 2 and 5 f 3 configurations as well as the hybridization of the 5 f electrons with the surrounding electron bath. The 5 f bands in UTe 2 turn out to be very narrow, which naturally explains the high tunability of its phase diagram. [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 043195] Published Thu Nov 20, 2025"
