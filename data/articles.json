Small-twist bilayers, heavily reconstructed, might equally remain superlubric, or turn spontaneously pinned through a so-called Aubry transition. Here, simulation and theory show that small twist graphene and other 2D bilayers remain unpinned even under high loads. A geometric criterion useful for future microscale friction planning–-the width of moiré domain walls larger than four lattice spacings-–characterizes this robust superlubricity. [Phys. Rev.

      "summary": "Nature Physics, Published online: 09 October 2025; doi:10.1038/s41567-025-03014-4 Imposing shear flow on a cell layer induces an ordering transition. Now it is shown that an intermediate phase of ordering occurs driven by an interplay between cellular activity and the aligning field."
