      "summary": "Spatial light modulation is vital for precision control in optics applications such as quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, but at ultraviolet wavelengths it has been hampered by device degradation and limited switching speed. This work overcomes those bottlenecks by employing a reflection‑based piston-micromirror array to shape UV light fields, correct aberrations, and switch patterns in sync with laser pulses at 1 kHz, without adding detectable phase noise. The method yields e.g. optical tweezers with subpercent intensity variation, and exceptionally uniform flat‑top beams, opening up the UV spectral range for applications based on arbitrary light shaping.

      "summary": "The authors show how specific geometric arrangement of finite-sized artificial square-ice structures directly governs their energy-relaxation pathways, and thus their probability of finding low-energy states. By systematically combining and modifying basic building blocks (4-loop and 4-vertex motifs), embedded and connected configurations can be designed to favor either monotonic ( quasi -deterministic) or intermittent (probabilistic) relaxation. Dipolar energy calculations and magnetic force microscopy support the findings. This research provides a design principle for creating spin ices for future computing applications. [Phys. Rev.

The all-in-one, plug-and-play nature of versatile RC offers substantial convenience for maintaining the functionality of real-world complex systems that suffer sporadic or temporary component failures.
