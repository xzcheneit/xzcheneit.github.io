      "summary": "To investigate the mechanism of radiation detection in diamonds, we developed a real time time dependent density functional theory based calculation scheme to evaluate changes in the density of states induced by alpha ray irradiation. A bulk diamond structural model was constructed, with impurities optionally introduced to assess their effect on electronic excitation. Simulations revealed that the passage of high speed helium ions, representing alpha particles, produced significant electronic excitation in the diamond model. Subsequent calculations of the excited state dynamics after ion removal indicated that excitation can persist for several hundred femtoseconds without triggering nonradiative relaxation. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a robust theoretical framework for evaluating the performance of diamond-based radiation detectors."

      "summary": "Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature -- supposedly unique to two dimensions -- that relaxation by head-on scattering is not efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists in isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\\sim T^2$ low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity relaxation rates as large as $40\\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic-like regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via transport measurements."

      "summary": "Altermagnets are an emerging class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization. These materials can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions. Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity altermagnetism."

      "summary": "Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems."

      "summary": "Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer a tunable platform for the realization of emergent phenomena in layered electron systems. While scanning probe microscopy techniques have proven useful for the characterization of surface states and 2D crystals, the subsurface imaging of quantum phenomena in multi-layer systems presents a significant challenge. In 3D heterostructures, states that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal detected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and interpretation. Here we present a quantum imaging technique that offers a glimpse into the third dimension by resolving states out of plane: it extracts the charge density landscape of individual atomic planes inside a vdW heterostructure, layer by layer. As a proof-of-concept, we perform layer-resolved imaging of quantum Hall states and charge disorder in double-layer graphene using milliKelvin microwave impedance microscopy. Here the discrete energy spectrum of the top layer enables transmission of microwaves through gapped states, thus opening direct access to quantum phases in the subsurface layer. Resolving how charge is distributed out-of-plane offers a direct probe of interlayer screening, revealing signatures of negative quantum capacitance driven by many-body correlations. At the same time, we extract key features of the band structure and thermodynamics, including gap sizes. Notably, by imaging the charge distribution on different atomic planes beneath the surface, we shed light on the roles of surface impurities and screening on the stability of fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that the uppermost graphene layer can serve as a top gate: This unlocks access to a wide range of phenomena that require displacement field control, from fractional Chern insulators in Moir\\'e superlattices to correlated states in multilayer graphene."

Depending on the processes that are suppressed by interference, the constraint may or may not be associated with an emergent global conservation; the latter kind having no mechanism of generation in time-independent settings. As an example, we construct an one-dimensional interacting spin model exhibiting strong Hilbert space fragmentation with and without dipole moment conservation, depending on the drive frequency. By probing the spatiotemporal profile of the out-of-time-ordered correlator, we show that this model, in particular, has initial states in which quantum information can be spatially localized - a useful feature in the field of quantum technologies. Our paradigm unifies various types of Hilbert space fragmentation that can be realized in driven systems."

Compared to standard approaches, the method converges rapidly and improves the accuracy of predictions for systems with sharp features in the density of states. This approach can be directly integrated into existing materials screening workflows, enabling the rapid identification of promising candidates that might otherwise be overlooked."

This exposes a conformal window at finite $N$. We further show that symmetry-breaking masses, far from being trivial, can collapse this window and drive the system to strong coupling, triggering dynamical mass generation."

The model incorporates the difference in average ligand-hole occupancy between Cu and Fe, the staggered magnetization of the Fe sublattice, volume strain, and intrinsic thermal expansion, together with their couplings. It qualitatively reproduces key thermodynamic properties of the ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ family, including the staggered magnetization, lattice volume, magnetic susceptibility, and the nearly linear temperature-pressure phase boundary. The framework predicts a pronounced elastic softening near the phase boundary, consistent with experiments where the bulk modulus of the low-pressure, charge-transferred antiferromagnetic phase exceeds that of the high-pressure, non-transferred paramagnetic phase. It also yields pressure-driven isothermal entropy changes, revealing that the intrinsic thermal expansion of the high- and low-temperature phases significantly shapes the overall barocaloric response. These results contrast with previous analyses of NdCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$, where thermal expansion was neglected in the entropy construction, and call for a reevaluation of barocaloric effects in quadruple perovskites."

      "summary": "Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a versatile technique for templating hierarchical porous materials. However, the underlying mechanisms of pattern formation remain incompletely understood. In this work, we present a detailed derivation and analysis of a quantitative phase-field model for simulating this nonequilibrium process. The phase-field model extends the thin-interface formulation of dilute binary alloy solidification with anti-trapping to incorporate the highly anisotropic energetic and kinetic properties of the partially faceted ice-water interface. This interface is faceted in the basal plane normal to the directions and atomically rough in other directions within the basal plane. On the basal plane, the model reproduces a linear or nonlinear kinetic relationship that can be linked to experimental measurements. In both cases, spontaneous parity breaking of the solidification front is observed, leading to the formation of partially faceted ice lamellae that drift laterally in one of the directions. We demonstrate that the drifting velocity is controlled by the kinetics on the basal plane and converges as the thickness of the diffuse solid-liquid interface decreases. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the form of the kinetic anisotropy, which is chosen here such that the inverse of the kinetic coefficient varies linearly from a finite value in the directions to zero in all other directions within the basal plane. Our results indicate that the drifting velocity of ice lamellae is not affected by the slope of this linear relation, and the radius and undercooling at the tip of an ice lamella converge at relatively small slope values. Consequently, the phase-field simulations remain quantitative with computationally tractable choices of both the interface thickness and the slope assumed in the form of the kinetic anisotropy."

      "summary": "This contribution provides a partial response to the titular statement since, it will be claimed,the ``why'' is not yet understood, but there is a pathway for achieving a more complete understanding. The sense of the community has been that, given a prospective metal hydride and pressure, the energy landscape can be surveyed computationally for thermodynamic and dynamic stability, the Eliashberg spectral function with its required input (energy bands, phonon modes, coupling matrix elements) can be calculated, and the critical temperature T$_c$ obtained. Satisfyingly large values of the electron-phonon coupling strength $\\lambda$=2-3 at high mean frequency are obtained, giving very reasonable agreement with existing high T$_c$ hydrides. Typically 80-85\\% of $\\lambda$ is attributable to high frequency H vibrations. This much was envisioned by Ashcroft two decades ago, so why should there be any angst? This paper addresses more specifically the question {\\it why hydrogen?} Light mass is indeed a factor, but with possibilities not yet explored. This paper provides a concise overview of related formal developments occurring sporadically over several decades that, when implemented, could resolve the question of {\\it why hydrogen, why so high T$_c$.} The dearth of success of numerous high throughput searches proposing higher T$_c$ materials, especially hydrides, is touched on briefly. Based on as yet unapplied developments in simplifying effects of atomic displacement, it is proposed that there is a straightforward path toward a deeper understanding of ``metallic hydrogen superconductivity\" in conjunction with added computational efficiency, and that some human-learning should assist in focusing the search for higher T$_c$ superconductors."

Recently, it has been recognized that floppy-rigid or fluid-solid transitions are harnessed by biological systems at all scales to drive form and function. This review focuses on the different mechanisms that can drive emergent rigidity transitions in biomechanical networks, and describes how they arise in mathematical formalisms and how they are observed in practice in experiments. The goal is to aid researchers in identifying mechanisms governing rigidity in their biological systems of interest, highlight mechanical features that are universal across different systems, and help drive new scientific hypotheses for observed mechanical phenomena in biology. Looking forward, we also discuss how biological systems might tune themselves towards or away from such transitions over developmental or evolutionary timescales."

The stacking sequences explored are inspired by the possible use of MXenes as precursors to enable relatively low temperature processing of high-temperature ceramics. We identified 67 new hexagonal, layered materials with thermal stability comparable or better than previously observed zeta phases. To assess their potential for high temperature applications, we used machine learning and physics-based models with DFT inputs to predict their melting temperatures and discovered several candidates on par with the current state of the art zeta-like phases and five with predicted melting temperatures above 2500 K. The findings expand the range of chemistries and structures for high-temperature applications."

Our Chain Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with parameters obtained from Pad\\'e approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient simulations: short chains are tractable with exact diagonalization, and longer ones with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular phases differ substantially with dot number. Here, large parameter regions are entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for exploring complex SC nanostructures."

      "summary": "The vertex model with homogeneous cell properties is known to exhibit a parameter degeneracy in which the system's dynamics is independent of the target area. Here, we show, for the heterogeneous vertex model where cells differ in size and stiffness, that degeneracy is also present with the average product of target areas and stiffness becoming dynamically irrelevant. Fixing this quantity is equivalent to fixing the global internal tissue pressure. Unless properly treated, this degeneracy undermines the physical relevance of key observables' numerical values, such as the shape index, cell pressure, and cell stress tensor. We present methods to resolve the degeneracy and to correctly set the gauge pressure via symmetry transformations applied to the cells' target areas. We further demonstrate that the degeneracy is removed under certain boundary conditions and partially lifted when spherical tissues are modeled using a locally planar approximation, leading to numerical consequences when fitting model parameters to experimental data. The approach extends beyond vertex models and provides a framework for testing whether the parameter spaces of other physical models are free from degeneracy."

      "summary": "Electron--phonon (e--ph) coupling governs electrical resistivity, hot-carrier cooling, and critically, thermal transport in solids. Recent first-principles advances now predict e--ph limited thermal conductivity from d-band metals and wide-band-gap semiconductors to 2D Dirac crystals without empirical parameters. In bulk metals, ab-initio lifetimes show that phonons, though secondary, still carry up to 40\\% of the heat once e--ph scattering is included. We next survey coupled Boltzmann frameworks, exemplified by \\textsc{elphbolt}, that capture mutual drag and ultrafast non-equilibrium in semiconductors. For 2D Dirac crystals, mirror symmetry, carrier density, strain, and finite size rearrange the scattering hierarchy: ZA modes dominate pristine graphene yet become the main resistive branch in nanoribbons once symmetry is broken. At low Fermi energies and high temperatures, the standard 3-particle decay is partially cancelled, elevating 4-particle processes and necessitating dynamically screened, higher-order theory. Throughout, we identify the microscopic levers such as the electronic density of states, phonon frequency, deformation potential, and show how doping, strain, or dielectric environment can tune e--ph damping. We conclude by outlining open challenges such as: developing coupled e--ph solvers, solving the full mode-to-mode Peierls--Boltzmann equation with 4-particle terms, embedding correlated electron methods in e--ph workflows, and leveraging higher-order e--ph coupling and symmetry breaking to realise phononic thermal diodes and rectifiers. Solving these challenges will elevate e--ph theory from a diagnostic tool to a predictive, parameter-free platform that links symmetry, screening, and many-body effects to heat and charge transport in next-generation electronic, photonic, and thermoelectric devices."

      "summary": "Twisted light (TL), a special kind of light carrying orbital angular momentum, provides a powerful tool for driving symmetry resolved transitions in quantum confined nanostructures. We study a realistic model where a TL pulse excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. To include image charge effects in layered systems, we use an effective electron electron potential of the form 1/r^n. For n = 2, the system exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and angular momentum resolved absorption. We show that the bare Coulomb 1/r interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light driven excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise symmetry-forbidden. In particular, TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem, exposing internal excitations through multi quanta orbital processes. More broadly, our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations, symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems, uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption."

      "summary": "The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which originates from spin-orbit coupling and relies on broken inversion symmetry, is recognized as a key ingredient in forming magnetic skyrmions. However, most 2D magnets exhibit inversion symmetry; therefore, the DMI is suppressed. Here, we propose a strategy to induce large DMI via lithium absorption on the surface of 2D magnets -- an experimentally feasible approach. Using first-principles and atomistic spin simulations, we predict the formation of nanoscale skyrmions in lithium-decorated monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ by imposing small out-of-plane magnetic fields ($B_z$). Notably, we find very large skyrmion energy barriers of more than 300 meV at $B_z = 0.4$ T, comparable to those observed in ferromagnet/heavy-metal interfaces. The origin of these unique skyrmions is attributed to the competition between strong DMI, exchange frustration, and small magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. We further show that the lifetimes of metastable skyrmions exceed one hour for temperatures up to 75 K."

      "summary": "The liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules is an important process for intracellular organization. Biomolecular sequence combinatorics leads to a large variety of proteins and nucleic acids which can interact to form a diversity of dense liquid (`condensate') phases. The relationship between sequence design and the diversity of the resultant phases is therefore of interest. Here, we explore this question using the DNA nanostar system which permits the creation of multi-phase condensate droplets through sequence engineering of the sticky end bonds that drive particle-particle attraction. We explore the theoretical limits of nanostar phase diversity, then experimentally demonstrate the ability to create 9 distinct, non-adhering nanostar phases that do not share components. We further study how thermal processing affects the morphology and dynamics of such a highly diverse condensate system. We particularly show that a rapid temperature quench leads to the formation of a densely packed 2-D layer of droplets that is transiently stabilized by caging effects enabled by the phase diversity, leading to glassy dynamics, such as slow coarsening and dynamic heterogeneity. Generally, our work provides experimental insight into the thermodynamics of phase separation of complex mixtures and demonstrates the rational engineering of complex, long-range, multi-phase droplet structures."

      "summary": "Van der Waals integration enables the creation of electronic and optoelectronic devices with unprecedented performance and novel functionalities beyond the existing material limitations. However, it is typically realized using a physical pick-up-and-place process to minimize interfacial damages and is hardly integrated into conventional lithography and metallization procedures. Here we demonstrate a simple in situ transfer strategy for van der Waals integration, in which a thin film of amorphous water ice acts as a buffer layer to shield against the bombardment of energetic clusters during metallization. After ice sublimation, the deposited metal film can be gently and in situ placed onto underlying substrates, to form an atomically clean and damage-free metal-semiconductor interface. This strategy allows ultra-clean and non-destructive fabrication of high-quality contacts on monolayer MoS2, which is extremely beneficial to produce a high-performance 2D field-effect transistor with an ultra-high on/off ratio of 1010, mobility of 80 (cm2 V-1s-1), and also with reduced Fermi level pinning effect. We also demonstrate the batch production of CVD-grown MoS2 transistor arrays with uniform electrical characteristics. Such a gentle and ultra-clean fabrication approach has been further extended to materials with high reactivity, such as halide perovskites. Our method can be easily integrated with mature semiconductor manufacturing technology and may become a generic strategy for fabricating van der Waals contacted devices."

However, conventional synthesis techniques offer limited control over the in-plane alignment of Te's crystallographic c-axis, hindering large-scale integration. Here, we report a novel, non-contact method to dynamically manipulate the c-axis orientation of Te thin films using linearly polarized picosecond laser pulses. We show that the c-axis can be omnidirectionally reoriented perpendicular to the laser polarization, even in initially polycrystalline films. This reorientation is fully reversible, allowing for rewritable and spatially selective control of the c-axis orientation post-deposition. Our light-driven approach enables programmable anisotropy in Te, opening new avenues for reconfigurable optoelectronic and photonic devices, such as active metasurfaces and CMOS-compatible architectures."

      "summary": "Chirality of spin waves offers an advantageous binary carrier for data transmission and processing with ultrafast dynamics and low power consumption. Altermagnets possess intrinsic chirality-splitting spin waves and vanishing net magnetization, thus emerging as ideal platforms to host chirality bits. However, active control of the chiral states remains a key challenge for realizing logic operations in chirality-based circuits. Here, we propose a novel scheme for reversibly switching spin-wave chirality in altermagnets between right- and left-handedness by tuning spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. Specifically, for in-plane spin polarization, SOC hybridizes with the altermagnetism, which induces a momentum-dependent competition. The chirality-splitting structure of spin waves is dominated by either SOC or altermagnetism in different Brillouin zone regions, allowing chirality switching by altering their relative strength. An experimental design utilizing an antiferromagnetic substrate to induce SOC and a heavy-metal stripe for chirality detection is proposed. Our work establishes a novel pathway for controlling spin-wave chirality in altermagnets via SOC, laying the groundwork for developing spintronic devices utilizing switchable chiral spin waves as dynamic information carriers."

      "summary": "Many mechanical structures, both engineered and biological, combine heavy rigid elements such as bones and beams with lightweight flexible ones such as cables and membranes. These are referred to as tensegrities, reflecting that cables can only support extensile tension. We model such systems via simulations of depleted triangular lattices in which we minimize the energies of tensegrities subject to strained boundary conditions. When there are equal numbers of cables and struts (which support only compressive tension), a cable and a strut together each contribute as much toward rigidity as a rod, with the two contributions being equal in the case of shear strain. Due to the highly nonaffine deformations at the rigidity transitions, the contribution of a cable (strut) can be significant even under global compression (dilation) despite a cable's inability to resist local compression. Further, we find that when neighboring elements tend to point away from one another, as is common in real systems, cables interact significantly more strongly with other cables than do cables with struts in supporting stress. These phenomena shed new light on a variety of realistic, disordered systems at the threshold of mechanical stability."

Focusing on open quantum systems governed by Markovian Lindblad dynamics, we derive general ensemble relations that connect the two approaches at all times, and we clarify how the steady states reached at long times relate to those reached at large jump counts. In regimes of metastability, long-lived intermediate states cause violations of experimentally testable cumulant relations, as we discuss. We also formulate a fluctuation theorem governing the probability of rare fluctuations in the first-passage time distributions based on results from full counting statistics. Our results apply to general integer-valued trajectory observables that do not necessarily increase monotonically in time. Three illustrative applications, a two-state emitter, a driven qubit, and a variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, highlight the physical implications of our results and provide guidelines for practical calculations. Our framework provides a complete picture of first-passage time statistics in Markovian quantum systems, encompassing multiple earlier results, and it has direct implications for current experiments in quantum optics, superconducting circuits, and nanoscale heat engines."

      "summary": "Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is a fascinating topic with broad scientific and technological impact. Twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer (tMoTe$_2$) is a newly discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI), exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect. Since the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the CI/FCI states. Here, we demonstrate control and switching of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe$_2$. At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e., electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature. Both optical training and direct switching of ferromagnetism are most effective near CI/FCI states, which we attribute to a gap enhanced valley polarization of photo-injected holes. We show that the magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of a ferromagnetic, and thus a CI (or FCI) domain. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological spintronics, quantum memories, and creation of exotic edge states by programmable patterning of integer and fractional QAH domains."

The topological band remains isolated from the rest of the bands for a substantial area of the $\\alpha - \\theta$ plane (where $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$ correspond to the hopping ratio and twist angle respectively) while exhibiting multiple phase transitions as a function of the aforementioned parameters via hybridization with its nearest bands. We study the evolution of the hybrid Wannier charge center and the Chern number to characterize the different emergent topological phases. Finally, the degree of flatness of the topological band is studied as a function of both $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$ to explicitly show the influence of quantum interference and band folding on the width of the topological band."

This is justified by flat bands and Dirac points susceptible to gap opening by spin-orbit coupling or magnetic ordering. The theoretical investigation of this quantum effect is possible exploring strategies like magnetic proximity, and strain or electric gating tuning. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall effect with a system Hamiltonian involving nearest-neighbour and complex next nearest-neighbour hopping, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, exchange field due to magnetic proximity, and charge density wave. Our preliminary analysis with these ingredients reveals that the system hosts multiple bands whose Chern numbers values suggest weak topological characteristics-not yet quantized, but showing signs of nontrivial Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing momentum-space winding, mimicking an orbital magnetic flux, through the momentum-dependence of the phase of the complex hopping, we find that two bands in the multiple band system carry opposite Chern numbers, indicating the emergence of chiral edge states and a quantized anomalous Hall effect. The rest remain trivial, but the system as a whole is no longer topologically inert."

Understanding the microscopic mechanisms that govern such unusual transport behavior is necessary to unravel the complex interplay of crystal structure, phonons, and collective excitations of these quasi-particles. Here, we use state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on quantum density functional theory to investigate the origin of experimentally measured unusually low and glassy thermal conductivity in semiconducting TlAgTe. Utilizing a unifying framework of anharmonic lattice dynamics theory that combine phonon self-energy induced frequency renormalization, particle-like Peierls ($kappa_l^P$) and wave-like coherent ($kappa_l^C$) thermal transport contributions including three and four-phonon scattering channels, we successfully explain the experimental results both in terms of magnitude and temperature dependence. Our analysis reveals that TlAgTe exhibits several localized phonon modes arising from concerted rattling-like vibration of Tl atoms, which show strong temperature dependence and enhanced four-phonon scattering rates that are dominated by Umklapp processes, suppressing $kappa_l^P$ to ultralow values. The ensuing strong anharmonicity induced by local structural distortions, lone-pair electrons, and rattling-like vibrations of the heavy cations lead to a transition from particle-like behavior to wave-like tunneling characteristics of the phonon modes above 40 cm$^-1$, contributing significantly to $kappa_l^C$ which increases with temperature. Our analysis uncovers important structure-property relationship, which may be used in designing of novel materials with tunable thermal conductivity."

We measure a large torque efficiency of -0.31, which originates from the significant orbital Hall effect in the SRO layer. Leveraging the low thermal conductivity of the mica substrate, a thermally-assisted switching mechanism is activated, enabling an ultralow threshold current density of 9.2x109 A/m2. This value represents a 90% reduction compared to conventional spin-torque devices and a 52% reduction against its rigid counterpart on a SrTiO3 substrate.

      "summary": "Conventional spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) face fundamental power limitations due to the low anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR < 0.3%) of ferromagnetic layers. To address this, we developed a synthetic antiferromagnetic spin-valve (SAF-SV) heterostructure [Ta/NiFe/Ru/NiFe/Cu/NiFe/Hf/Pt] that enables efficient giant magnetoresistance (GMR)-based detection of SHNO dynamics at room temperature. The NiFe/Ru/NiFe SAF reference layer, operating in the spin-flop state, couples with the NiFe free layer through a Cu spacer to achieve a remarkable GMR ratio of 0.568% - exhibiting complete independence of magnetic field/current orientation. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) verifies that the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of the free layer can be effectively modulated by dc current through the Pt heavy metal layer, while maintaining decoupled dynamics from the SAF layer. Thermal management via high-thermal-conductivity SiC substrates and AlN capping layers successfully mitigates current-shunting-induced Joule heating. Notably, stable auto-oscillation peaks are observed at 820 mA bias current, with oscillation frequency tunable by external magnetic field and potential dual-mode behavior at low fields. This work establishes a new paradigm for room-temperature, high-power spintronic oscillators, offering significant potential for neuromorphic computing and coherent RF communication applications."

      "summary": "Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature. Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the spin-wave control fields -selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy axes orthogonal to the film magnetization- and by using color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave technologies."

      "summary": "Layers of perovskites, found in 3D materials, 2D heterostructures, and nanotubes, often distort from high symmetry to facilitate dipole polarisation that is exploitable in many applications. Using density-functional theory calculations, ferroelectricity in bilayers of the 2D materials PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 is shown to be controlled by bond breakage and formation processes that act as binary switches. These stacking-dependent processes turn on and off as a function of relaxation from high-symmetry structures and the application of biaxial strain, and their concerted rearrangements lead to low energy barriers for ferroelectric polarisation switching. Structures with symmetry intermediate between high-symmetry octahedral forms and low-symmetry ferroelectric forms are identified, allowing the intrinsic processes associated with traditional \"ferrodistortive\" and \"antiferrodistortive\" distortions of TiO6 octahedra to be identified. Ferrodistortive-mode activity is shown to be generated by the simultaneous application of two different types of curvilinear antiferrodistortive motions. In this way, four angular variabes control polarisation switching through the concerted making and breaking of chemical bonds. These subltities make the polarisation sensitive to chemical-environment and temperature effects that manipulate strain and structure, features exploitable in futuristic devices."

      "summary": "The self-amplifying creeping of salts can produce striking macroscopic structures, such as desert roses in arid regions and salt pillars near saline lakes. While these formations are visually remarkable, salt crystallization, often seen as efflorescence on surfaces, also poses significant challenges for cultural heritage conservation, materials science, and soil management. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms underlying self-organized crystallization within efflorescence deposits. Our findings reveal that these porous salt deposits exhibit pronounced self-similarity, with the crystallization process recurring at multiple length scales. This results in smaller replicas of the overall structure nested within larger ones, creating fractal geometries similar to those found in cauliflower and broccoli. By performing controlled evaporation experiments and microscale analysis using advanced imaging techniques combined with fractal dimension analysis, we uncover the hierarchical and size-controlled precipitation of cubic microcrystals within the porous efflorescence. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical growth model demonstrating that the ultimate height of the macroscopic salt deposit is primarily determined by the initial mass of salt, rather than by the interplay of capillary and viscous forces when salt solution flows within the porous salt structure."

      "summary": "We employ mesoscopic simulations to study active polymers in a solvent via multi-particle collision dynamics. We investigate linear chains in which either the head or tail monomer exerts an active force, directed away from or towards its neighbor, respectively, while the remaining monomers are passive. We find that, in contrast to flexible chains, for stiff chains the position of the active monomer has minimal influence on both the structural and dynamic properties of the chain. An active head monomer pulls the chain behind it, straightening the backbone -- an effect that can be interpreted as activity-induced stiffening. In contrast, an active tail pushes into the chain, causing crumpling. This leads to faster decorrelation of the polymer backbone over time, rendering the active motion less persistent. These effects occur regardless of whether hydrodynamic interactions are included or not. Hydrodynamics is included by the imposition of a local counter-force in the surrounding fluid, as opposed to distributing the former equally to all fluid elements. By specifying the position of this counterforce onto the fluid, we can tune the hydrodynamic flow fields of the active polymers being both contractile and extensile. Interestingly, the emerging pusher- and puller flow fields are strongly influenced by the force propagation inside the polymer chain."

      "summary": "The frustrated insulating magnet can stabilize a spiral spin liquid, arising from cooperative fluctuations among a subextensively degenerate manifold of spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space. The atomic-mixing-free honeycomb antiferromagnet GdZnPO has recently emerged as a promising spiral spin-liquid candidate, hosting nontrivial topological excitations. Despite growing interest, the transport and topological properties of spiral spin liquids remain largely unexplored experimentally. Here, we report transport measurements on high-quality, electrically insulating GdZnPO single crystals. We observe a giant low-temperature magnetic thermal conductivity down to $\\sim$50 mK, described by $\\kappa_{xx}^\\mathrm{m}$ $\\sim$ $\\kappa_0+\\kappa_1T$, where both $\\kappa_0$ and $\\kappa_1$ are positive constants associated with excitations along and off the spiral contour in reciprocal space, respectively. This behavior parallels the magnetic specific heat, underscoring the presence of mobile low-energy excitations intrinsic to the putative spiral spin liquid. Furthermore, the observed positive thermal Hall effect confirms the topological nature of at least some of these excitations. Our findings provide key insights into the itinerant and topological properties of low-lying spin excitations in the spiral spin-liquid candidate."

The total number of Ba-based ternary chalcogenides in the Materials Project database was found to be 279. Materials screening based on bandgap size and stability reduced the number of compounds to 19. The performance of an absorber depends on the charge carrier lifetime, which is controlled by non-radiative processes involving defects. Hence, we investigated the intrinsic defects and p-type dopability of the compounds. We identified two Ba-based compounds, namely \\ch{BaCu2Se2} and \\ch{ZrBaSe3}, as promising absorbers for single-junction and tandem cells and investigated them in detail."

      "summary": "Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases, temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models."

We reveal that the linear optical conductivity reflects quantum metric, which remains finite irrespective of the diminishing joint density-of-states at lower photon energy. It is also confirmed that the magnetic injection current enhances depending on the energy of the Fermi level relative to the Dirac point.

In addition, other stationary states are found without the quasi-particle assumption and in a strongly coupled system.

Superconducting materials exhibiting high uniformity, large absorption cross-section and atomic-scale thickness are desirable to extend single-photon detection from the near-infrared up to the terahertz regime, where existing material choices are especially constrained. Substrate independence would further open the way to integrate detectors onto functional materials and heterostructures, enhancing performance and enabling proximal read-out of a wide range of individual excitations. Here, we top-down shape the prototypical two-dimensional superconductor niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) into few-layer nanowires less than 100 nm wide and demonstrate single-photon detection at 780 and 1550 nm. At the same time, the dark-count rate remains below 1 Hz up to the switching current and we achieve a timing jitter below 50 ps. We use a diffusive hot-spot model to estimate a theoretical cut-off wavelength that surpasses the millimetre range. Our results open up routes toward quantum limited detectors integrated into quantum-photonic circuits and quantum devices, with the potential for novel detection capabilities and unprecedented energy sensitivity."

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover striking dynamical similarities despite their fundamentally different structural organizations. Both systems exhibit pronounced dynamic heterogeneities, as evidenced by the cage-trapping plateaus in the mean-squared displacement and the pronounced peaks in the non-Gaussian parameter. In both cases, we observe a strong correlation between local structural order and dynamic propensity, indicating similar structure-dynamics relationships, albeit driven by distinct microscopic mechanisms. Despite these parallels, their vibrational properties diverge: the DDQC exhibits multiple peaks linked to phason dynamics, while the supercooled liquid displays a characteristic boson peak. Analysis of vibrational eigenmodes shows that both systems exhibit extended modes at low frequencies. At high frequencies, however, the DDQC maintains a higher density of topological defects, reflecting its quasi-long-range order. Finally, we contextualize these findings by comparing both systems to a square crystal. While the dynamics appears similar across all three systems, the vibrational and topological features clearly distinguish the DDQC and glass from the crystalline state. These results underscore a surprising universality in dynamical behavior across structurally diverse systems and provide new insights into how structural organization shapes motion in soft-matter systems."

However, bulk anisotropic materials suitable for such applications remain relatively scarse and are often challenging to synthesize as thin films. Additionally, the optical losses as well as the complex structuration of anisotropic metamaterials hinder their integrability in photonic devices. Based on ellipsometry measurements coupled with reflectance, it is demonstrated here that Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) SrO(SrTiO 3 ) N phases (STO-RP N ), epitaxial thin films composed of a SrTiO 3 lattice periodically interrupted by one SrO atomic plane every N unit cells, exhibit pronounced dichroism and birefringence over a broad spectral range. Notably, this anisotropy is tunable by adjusting the RP order N. In contrast to most other anisotropic materials reported in the literature, STO-RP N thin layers can be fabricated using industry-standard growth processes. As it can be epitaxially grown on Si and GaAs using SrTiO 3 templates, the work paves the way for their compact integration on these photonic platforms."

Here, we demonstrate microscale back-contacted optoelectronic halide perovskite artificial synapses that leverage ion migration induced by a bias voltage to modulate their photocurrent. The photocurrent changes are due to the accumulation of mobile ions, which induces a transient electric field in the perovskite. The photocurrent changes are volatile, decaying on the order of seconds. The photocurrent changes can be controlled by both the applied voltage and illumination. The symmetric device supports changing of the photocurrent polarity, switching between inhibitory and exhibitory functioning. The photocurrent can be updated by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)-learning rules inspired by biology. We show with simulations how this could be exploited as an attention mechanism in a neuromorphic detector. Our fabrication procedure is compatible with high-density integration with CMOS and memristive neuromorphic networks for energy-efficient visual data processing inspired by the brain."

Starting from a lattice model with pairwise dynamics that minimally break detailed balance, we derive a coarse-grained dynamical theory for spatio-temporal density fluctuations and reveal an elevated effective temperature at short wavelengths.

      "summary": "We present direct observation of the ring-down dynamics in the rotating frame of a resonantly driven single-mode nonlinear nanomechanical resonator. An additional close to resonance harmonic force excites nonlinear oscillations about the fixed point in the rotating frame. When the secondary drive is removed, we measure decay of the in-phase and quadrature components toward this fixed point. We show that the decay of the in-phase signal is non-exponential, even though the vibration amplitude decays exponentially if both forces are switched off. A minimalistic model captures these dynamics as well as the spectrum of the vibrations excited by the additional force, relating them to the dissipation-induced symmetry breaking of the dynamics in the rotating frame."

For this reason, the measurement of the 3D strain field is crucial for a detailed understanding and for further developments of material properties through strain engineering. However, measuring strain variations along the electron beam direction has remained a major challenge for (scanning-) transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). In this article, we present a method for 3D strain field determination using 4D-STEM. The method is based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects, which occur at strain field variations along the beam direction. We test the method against simulated data with a known ground truth and demonstrate its application to an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown Al$_{0.47}$Ga$_{0.53}$N layer."

      "summary": "The wear behavior of two amorphous and polycrystalline forms of MoS2 prepared by magnetron sputtering has been characterized in a combined nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy study. From the analysis of the depth and width of wear tracks estimated after scratching the surfaces with a Berkovich indenter and a loading force up to 2 mN, we conclude that both forms follow the Archard wear equation, and the wear resistance is about four times higher on the amorphous MoS2. Moreover, a comparison of lateral force maps on pristine and worn areas shows a considerable reduction of friction on both forms, which is possibly due to the significant smoothing of the surfaces caused by scratching. With normal forces in the micro N range, the analysis is made difficult by the fact that the linear dimensions of the wear tracks are comparable to those of the granular structures forming the surfaces. Even if the Archard equation could not be tested in this case, the wear resistance is considerably larger on amorphous MoS2 also on the nanoscale. In this way, our results disclose information on the nanotribology of MoS2 thin films in forms different from the layered structures commonly discussed in the literature. The amorphous form outperforms the polycrystalline one."

Magnetron sputtering was used to fabricate the Ta-Cu NMM films with a periodicity (equal Ta and Cu layer thickness) from 6 to 80 nm, with resulting structure exhibiting strongly incoherent tetragonal beta-Ta and face-centered cubic Cu phase. The high-load indentation test, TEM studies, and the rCLS model collectively demonstrate that all NMM films predominantly undergo plastic deformation. This plastic deformation primarily occurs within the soft Cu layer, while the propagation of dislocations across the incoherent interface is largely excluded."

      "summary": "We investigate Coulomb drag in a system of two capacitively coupled superconducting nanowires. In this context, drag refers to the appearance of a stationary voltage in the passive wire in response to a current bias applied to the active one. Quantum phase slips (QPS) in the biased wire generate voltage fluctuations that can be transmitted to the other. Using perturbative and semiclassical approaches, we show that when both wires are superconducting the induced voltage vanishes due to exact cancellation of plasmon contributions. By contrast, when the second wire is tuned below the superconductor-insulator transition and develops a mass gap, this cancellation is lifted and a finite drag voltage emerges. The drag coefficient exhibits a crossover from weak drag in short wires to a maximal value set by the mutual capacitance in long wires. A semiclassical picture of voltage pulse propagation clarifies the physical origin of the effect: the mass term synchronizes plasmon modes and prevents complete cancellation of induced signals. Our results establish a mechanism of mass-induced Coulomb drag in low-dimensional superconductors and suggest new routes for probing nonlocal transport near quantum criticality."

The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal."

We show that polysilicon exhibits electroadhesion only under positive bias applied to the substrate monocrystalline wafer, which we interpret as a result of the reduced mobility of holes, with respect to electrons, within polysilicon. Overall, our findings reveal that electrostatic interactions can significantly enhance adhesion and friction between stiff and smooth surfaces, which can be important for example in precision positioning applications."

Similar junctional fluctuations have proven a very useful tool in the vertex model literature, and we hope they will be equally helpful to the multi-phase field model approach.

In Poiseuille flow, particle deformability and nematic elasticity induce banding, where particles near the walls are aligned, and those near the centre of the channel oscillate in direction and shape. Our results show that particle deformability can lead to complex behaviour even in simple flows, suggesting new microfluidic experiments."

      "summary": "The relationship between cell density and velocity is often assumed to be negative, reflecting crowding-induced suppression of movement. However, observations across systems reveal a more nuanced picture: while some emphasize contact inhibition of locomotion, others suggest that dense regions exhibit enhanced activity due to force generation and stress buildup. Here, using experimental measurements we show that density-velocity relations in epithelial monolayers are inherently scale dependent. By coarse-graining cell trajectories over multiple spatial windows, we find that cell velocity correlates positively with local density at small scales, but negatively at large scales. Employing traction force measurements, we find that this crossover coincides with the emergence of mechanical pressure segregation, defining a characteristic length scale beyond which crowding dominates. A minimal model incorporating activity-induced shape changes reproduces this crossover and identifies the competition between active force generation and mechanical confinement as the underlying mechanism. Our results reconcile conflicting views of density-regulated migration and highlight an emergent length scale as a key factor in interpreting collective cell dynamics."

In this letter, we introduce a methodology to quantitatively determine the multipole moment contributions in anomalous Hall effect through angle-dependent anomalous Hall current, with explicit incorporation of discrete crystal symmetries. Our technique uniquely enables the investigation of octupole contribution in non-periodic systems, particularly at interfaces and surfaces. Typically, in (Ag$_{2}$Fe$_{5}$)$_{n}$ multilayers with quantum-well-engineered $k$-point selectivity, we observe an octupole-dominated anomalous Hall effect in conventional ferromagnetic materials, through first-principles calculations. These results fundamentally challenge the existing theoretical understanding of the anomalous Hall effect, showing that even the conventional contribution arises not only from the dipole moment (net magnetization). Furthermore, we establish practical control over the octupole contribution through two distinct approaches: interface engineering and magnetic ordering reconfiguration, opening new possibilities for manipulating higher-order transport effects."

Intrinsic crystal deformation mechanisms, investigated experimentally on single crystals with low dislocation densities, have been studied theoretically through atomistic simulations, mainly focusing on lattice-induced instabilities. Here, instead, we employ density functional theory and a thermodynamic analysis to probe and analyze the way in which the electronic charge of crystalline solids (Cu, Al and diamond) responds to uniaxial strain and affects their mechanical properties. Indeed, despite the very simple nature of our models, and in the presence of minimal atomic displacements, we find that the stress strain curves of Cu and Al deviate from a simple linear elastic behavior. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the features of such curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order phase transitions. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the features of such curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order phase transitions, which originate from Van-Hove singularities of the electronic density of states crossing the Fermi level and electron redistribution within the solid, respectively."

Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), known for its exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a cornerstone material for magnonics and is typically grown into thin films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates due to near-perfect lattice matching. However, the paramagnetic nature of GGG introduces damping mechanisms detrimental to quantum applications at low temperatures. Here, we present a study of magnetic damping in a 150$\\,$nm-thick YIG film grown on a 500$\\,\\mu$m-thick yttrium scandium gallium aluminium garnet (YSGAG) substrate, a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 30$\\,$mK, we compare the damping characteristics of the YIG/YSGAG system with those of a conventional YIG/GGG reference system. Our results demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains low magnetic damping from room temperature, with $\\alpha = 4.29\\times10^{-5}$, which is the lowest value reported so far for YIG/GGG films and comparable to the best YIG bulk material, and down to 30$\\,$mK, with no significant temperature-dependent increase in damping. In this substrate, the low-temperature damping mechanisms associated with paramagnetic spins, prominent in GGG, are effectively eliminated. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies."

However, achieving such optical control for strongly correlated electron systems in the steady-state has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate all-optical switching of the spin-valley degree of freedom of itinerant ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 homobilayers. This system uniquely features flat valley-contrasting Chern bands and exhibits a range of strongly correlated phases at various moir\\'e lattice fillings, including Chern insulators and ferromagnetic metals. We show that the spin-valley orientation of all of these phases can be dynamically reversed by resonantly exciting the attractive polaron transition with circularly-polarized light. These findings not only constitute the first direct evidence for non-thermal switching of a ferromagnetic spin state at zero magnetic field, but also demonstrate the possibility of dynamical control over topological order parameter, paving the way for all-optical generation of chiral edge modes and topological quantum circuits."

The system consists of 23Na, 39K, and 41K atomic species, in which the binary mixtures of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) can form self-bound quantum droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Two such droplets can bind together by the shared 39K component, forming a stable \"dimer\" structure, which displays vibrational modes analogous to a classical diatomic molecule. A simple protocol is proposed to create a stable linear chain formed by periodic repetition of this basic building block, i.e. an alternating sequence of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) droplets. This structure exhibits both periodic density modulations from the droplet ordering and global phase coherence due to the shared 39K component, satisfying the criteria for supersolidity, and therefore adding another system to the gallery of supersolid structures in cold atoms arena. The low-energy excitation spectrum, probed by density perturbations, identifies modes corresponding to droplet vibrations close to the ones expected from a classical diatomic chain."

      "summary": "We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in one-dimensional Mott insulators at energies below the charge gap. By employing nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we predict that in the presence of a magnetic impurity at the boundary, characteristic Fermi-edge singularity features can appear at subgap energies in the TDOS near the boundary. In contrast to the Kondo effect in a metal, these resonances are strongly asymmetric and of power-law form. The power-law exponent is universal and determined by the spinon-Kondo effect."

      "summary": "Kagome metals provide a material platform for probing new correlated quantum phenomena due to the naturally incorporated linear dispersions, flat bands, and Van Hove singularities in their electronic structures. Among these quantum phenomena is the charge density wave (CDW), or the distortion of the lattice structure due to the motion of correlated electrons through the material. CDWs lower the energy of the compound, creating an energy gap that facilitates behaviors akin to superconductivity, nonlinear transport, or other quantum correlated phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe has been shown to host a CDW transition at approximately 100 K, and its occurrence is strongly influenced by the sample annealing conditions. However, a notable gap in the literature is the lack of clear thermoelectric transport evidence for electronic structure changes associated with this CDW transition. Here we present evidence of electron behavior modification due to annealing disorder via thermoelectric measurements on FeGe crystals presenting a CDW transition and those without a CDW. The observed Nernst effect and Seebeck effect under sufficient annealing demonstrate modified electrical transport properties resulting from induced disorder, including a change in carrier sign and an enhancement of the Nernst effect due to the CDW. Our results provide evidence of multiple phase transitions, which confirms the influence of CDW on the thermal properties of FeGe and demonstrates the suppression of CDW with sufficient disordering."

Both the atomically disordered ($A1$) fcc phase, as well as the atomically ordered, tetragonal $\\textrm{L}1_0$ phase - which is under consideration as a material for a rare-earth-free 'gap' magnet for advanced engineering applications - are investigated. Across an ensemble of NEB calculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of compositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered structures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile than Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of the ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure. Specifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice distortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around vacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms remain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a key role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe atoms. These results shed atomic-scale insight into the longstanding experimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys."

Here we present a general method to identify topological materials by analyzing the local electronic density, $\\delta \\rho(\\boldsymbol{r})$, and connecting it to Atiyah Singer index theorems. This approach enables a direct measurement of the winding number, the topological invariant of Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry, through a contour independent dislocation pattern of $\\delta \\rho(\\boldsymbol{r})$ created by interference from topological defects. Our method thus provides a direct route to detect and characterize quantum topological states, paving the way for their use as robust and entangleable building blocks in quantum technologies."

This behavior is explained in the present paper as a result of the charge carrier trapping by impurities in the boron nitride. A kinetic equation for the charge carriers subject to trapping and interacting with acoustic phonons is derived. This equation is solved numerically, and the equilibrium solutions are used to evaluate the frequency exponent according to the quantum theory of 1/f noise. It is found that the frequency exponent does develop several minima and maxima, provided that the trapping probability is sufficiently wide and has a threshold with respect to the charge carrier energy. A detailed comparison with the experimental data is made, and the results are used to estimate the energy threshold and the trapping cross-section."

The geometries of structures with up to 64 atoms were then optimized using density-functional theory (DFT) with automated workflows and curated input protocols. The procedure was repeated for different functionals (and computational protocols), with the latest version (MC3D PBEsol-v2) comprising 32013 unique structures. All versions of the MC3D are made available on the Materials Cloud portal, which provides a graphical interface to explore and download the data.

Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \\sim 1$ K, evidenced by the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete spin freezing below $T_f \\approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T = 0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below $T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate, and a gapped excitation centered at $\\hbar\\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow component $\\tau_{\\mathrm{slow}} \\sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component $\\tau_{\\mathrm{fast}} \\sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for QSI systems.

The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\\\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \\textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \\textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification."

Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a \"global symmetry reduction\" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries."

This provides necessary conditions for arbitrary fermionic states and is sufficient within the Gaussian setting. Our main result is a finite de Finetti--type theorem: we derive trace-norm bounds between $(k_1,k_2)$-extendible fermionic Gaussian states and separable states, improving previous exponential scaling to linear in the number of modes, with complementary relative entropy and squashed entanglement bounds. For two modes, upper and lower bounds match at order $1/\\sqrt{k_1 k_2}$. Extendibility also provides operational support for one of the different notions of separability in fermionic systems.

We find that KUR violations arise only in one model. This asymmetry originates from spontaneous emission, which breaks the structural symmetry between the configurations and modifies their coherence dynamics. While we analyze several contributing factors-including statistical signatures such as the Fano factor and the ratio of dynamical activity to current-our results show that the decisive mechanism is the slower decoherence in one configuration, which enables quantum violations of the classical steady-state KUR bound. By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration suppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior. These findings highlight the critical role of decoherence mechanisms in determining fundamental thermodynamic bounds and provide insights for the design of quantum heat engines in which the control of decoherence is central to suppressing fluctuations and enhancing reliable performance."

Here, motivated by the evolutionary process of genetic hitchhiking in a selectively neutral population, we consider a model in which the mean size of the population increases linearly. We are interested in understanding how the fluctuations in the population size impact the first passage statistics, and study the fixation probability that a mutant reaches frequency one by a given time in a population whose size follows a conditional Wright-Fisher process. We find that at sufficiently short and long times, the fixation probability can be approximated by a model that ignores temporal correlations between the inverse of the population size, but at intermediate times, it is significantly smaller than that obtained by neglecting the correlations. Our analytical and numerical study of the correlation functions show that the conditional Wright-Fisher process of interest is neither a stationary nor a Gaussian process; we also find that the variance of the inverse population size initially increases linearly with time $t$ and then decreases as $t^{-2}$ at intermediate times followed by an exponential decay at longer times. Our work emphasizes the importance of temporal correlations in populations with fluctuating size that are often ignored in population-genetic studies of biological evolution."

      "summary": "The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems."

      "summary": "The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1) symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel, propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in stochastic QED and wide DNNs."

Here, we identify the molecular origin behind this ubiquitous phenomenon using macroscopic tribology and surface molecular spectroscopy. We demonstrate that reducing friction through surfactants hinges on charge complementarity: surfactants of opposite charge to the solid surface reduce friction even at extreme contact pressures, whereas like-charged or neutral surfactants are ineffective. Oppositely charged surfactants self-assemble into dense and robust molecular brushes, creating a persistent lubrication beyond the limits of conventional mechanisms. This charge-mediated approach offers a universal and scalable framework for friction control across length scales without significant surface modification."

      "summary": "Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms."

State-of-the-art approaches combine the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism and density functional theory (DFT). However, as device dimensions do not exceed a few nanometers anymore, electrons are confined in ultra-small volumes, giving rise to strong electron-electron interactions. To account for these critical effects, DFT+NEGF solvers should be extended with the GW approximation, which massively increases their computational intensity. Here, we present the first implementation of the NEGF+GW scheme capable of handling NRFET geometries with dimensions comparable to experiments. This package, called QuaTrEx, makes use of a novel spatial domain decomposition scheme, can treat devices made of up to 84,480 atoms, scales very well on the Alps and Frontier supercomputers (>80% weak scaling efficiency), and sustains an exascale FP64 performance on 42,240 atoms (1.15 Eflop/s)."

We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory."

      "summary": "The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media."

After an appropriate change of variables, Lanczos coefficients with even and odd indices are described by two independent Toda chains, related at the level of the initial conditions. Consistency of the resulting equations can be used to show that certain scale-invariant models necessarily have a degenerate spectrum. We dub this self-consistency-based approach the ''Krylov bootstrap''. The known analytic behavior of the Toda chain at late times translates into analytic control over the 2pt function and Krylov complexity at very low temperatures. We also discuss the behavior of Lanczos coefficients when the temperature is low but not much smaller than the spectral gap, and elucidate the origin of the staggering behavior of Lanczos coefficients in this regime."

Whereas our recent study reveals that the CN can be reasonablly addressed for individual microscopic configuration by two different measures of special vector field on configuration space2,3 and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence DKL, their direct correlation on real lattices, is still unclear. We here address this problem for fcc-based equiatomic binary alloys that have been one of the most studied system in the context of CN. We confirm that while local contribution to CN from DKL for each configuration exhibits strong, positive correlation with the vector field, non-local contribution from DKL exhibit no effective correlation. We find that depedence of the averaged non-local nonlinearity over all configurations can be well-characterized by normalied geometric distance in configurational polyhedra between for practical and separable system in terms of the structural degrees of freedom. This fact certainly indicates that non-local nonlinearity has profound connection to the geometric configuration for ground-state structures of alloys on configuration space."

At low temperatures, however, long-range correlations between the regions with different phases become important and establish global phase coherence and hence superconductivity in the system. We develop a mean-field theory to describe a phase transition between the preformed Cooper pair and superconducting states. This scenario of superconductivity applies not only to conductors with parabolic bands but also to the flat-band systems in which flat and dispersive bands coexist and are responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs as well as their phase synchronization."

The effective $g$-factor (15-45) is notably enhanced compared to bare PbTe wires ($<$ 10) due to the presence of In, differing from Al-hybrids. Josephson devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrents.

In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \\textit{ab\\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and as their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we show that the recoverable stored energy can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase due to a pinched double-loop field hysteresis."

In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches with varying thicknesses of the middle TI spacer layer. The well-quantized QAH effect is observed in all these samples, and the IEC modulates its critical behavior between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau phase transition (PPT), thinner QAH samples exhibit a two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent longitudinal resistance.

The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. In order to overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest including graphene, phosphorene, MoS$_2$, CrI$_3$, VSe$_2$, GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT."

      "summary": "The rapid advancement of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has significantly enhanced our ability to study microbial communities. The eubiotic composition of these communities is crucial for maintaining ecological functions and host health. Species diversity is only one facet of a healthy community organization; together with abundance distributions and interaction structures, it shapes reproducible macroecological states, i.e., joint statistical fingerprints that summarize whole-community behavior. Despite recent developments, a theoretical framework connecting empirical data with ecosystem modeling is still in its infancy, particularly in the context of disordered systems. Here, we present a novel framework that couples statistical physics tools for disordered systems with metagenomic data, explicitly linking diversity, interactions, and stability to define and compare these macroecological states. By employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions, we reveal two different emergent patterns of species interaction networks and species abundance distributions for healthy and diseased microbiomes. On the one hand, healthy microbiomes have similar community structures across individuals, characterized by strong species interactions and abundance diversity consistent with neutral stochastic fluctuations. On the other hand, diseased microbiomes show greater variability driven by deterministic factors, thus resulting in less ecologically stable and more divergent communities. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered system theory to characterize microbiomes and to capture the role of ecological interactions on stability and functioning."

We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading."

Recently, R\\'enyi entropy, a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, has gained attention across various fields of physics due to its simpler functional form, making it more practical for measurements. In this paper, we compute the R\\'enyi version of complexity for prototypical mean-field disordered models, including the random energy model, its generalization, referred to as the random free energy model, and the $p$-spin spherical model. We first demonstrate that the R\\'enyi complexity with index $m$ is related to the free energy difference for a generalized annealed Franz-Parisi potential with $m$ clones. Detailed calculations show that for models having one-step replica symmetry breaking (RSB), the R\\'enyi complexity vanishes at the Kauzmann transition temperature $T_K$, irrespective of $m>1$, while RSB solutions are required even in the liquid phase. This study strengthens the link between R\\'enyi entropy and the physics of disordered systems and provides theoretical insights for its practical measurements."

Using the three-orbital Emery model, we explore how, and under which conditions, doping-induced antiferromagnetic ordering of weak magnetic moments on the oxygen sites can lead to unconventional d-wave magnetism with spin-split electronic bands. The mechanism for forming such altermagnetic (AM) states in cuprates does not rely on a lowering of the crystal symmetry but rather on interaction-induced formation of magnetic moments on directional oxygen orbitals within the crystallographic unit cell. Therefore, we obtain two different types of AM, namely a (0,0)-AM and a ($\\pi$,$\\pi$)-AM. We explore different regimes and challenges for realizing oxygen AM supported by Hartree-Fock calculations and complementary exact diagonalization of small clusters. While the region of interacting parameters needed to realize these states may be difficult to achieve in known high-T$_c$ cuprates, we propose a scenario to realize AM induced by oxygen magnetic moments in a cuprate-based candidate compound using density functional theory and discuss experimental implications."

It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, current without density gradient, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a new transport effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active processes driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena."

Analysis of drainage in lattice-based pore networks identifies two key quantities, the percolation threshold and residual saturation, as topological invariants. These descriptors, which are based solely on connectivity rather than geometric details, capture the essential structure of the network. The percolation threshold is interpreted as a topological phase transition, marking the transition from global connectivity of the defending fluid to isolated clusters of trapped fluid. The universality of scaling exponents across different lattice geometries reveals the existence of topological universality classes, where systems with equivalent connectivity display identical critical behavior. This topological framework underscores the robustness of the identified invariants and provides a general basis for upscaling pore-scale processes in complex media."

Often, the dynamic critical exponent $z$ is set to be one as the most natural choice for quantum field theory representations, which further implies emergence of higher space-time symmetries near QCPs in many condensed matter systems. In this article, we study a family of topological quantum critical points (tQCPs) where the $z=1$ quantum field theory is prohibited in a fundamental representation by a protecting symmetry, resulting in tQCPs with $z=2$. We further illustrate that when strong interactions are properly taken into account, the stable weakly interacting gapless tQCPs with $z=2$ can further make a transition to another family of gapless tQCPs with dynamic critical exponent $z=1$, without breaking the protecting symmetry. Our studies suggest that dynamic critical exponents, as well as the degrees of freedom in fermion fields, can crucially depend on interactions in topological quantum phase transitions; in tQCPs, to a large extent, they are better thought of as emergent properties."

At large magnetic field, the competition between confinement and electronic interactions gives rise to a quantum dot located at the saddle point of the quantum point contact.

Unlike those with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the stable configurations of DWs in PMA nanotubes are influenced not only by exchange interactions but also by magnetostatic interactions induced by the radial component of magnetization. Particularly, the magnetostatic interactions lead to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)-like effects that stabilize chiral N\\'{e}el-type DWs. We derive expressions for the effective magnetic fields acting on DWs within PMA nanotubes and quantify spin-orbit torque (SOT) driven DW motion using an analytical one-dimensional model, which is validated by micromagnetic simulations. Our results show that the DMI-like field due to magnetostatic interactions can be as significant as the contribution of material-induced DMI in nanotubes with diameters below $100\\,$nm. This implies that the direction and speed of DW motion in the PMA nanotubes could differ from those observed in flat nanoribbons composed of the same material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DW velocity can be effectively controlled by adjusting the tube diameter and exchange stiffness constant of the magnetic layer, rather than relying solely on material-induced DMI. These insights are expected to greatly expand the potential applications of PMA nanotube-based DW devices."

      "summary": "We study the Josephson effect in one-dimensional SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnetic layers (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the potential barrier at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface can induce a quantized resonant tunneling effect. This effect not only modifies the amplitude of the critical current but also affects the phase of the Josephson current. As the exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, the critical current displays periodic resonance peaks. These peaks occur under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)} d_{1(2)} = \\left(n_{1(2)} + 1/2\\right) \\pi$, where $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\\hbar v_F)$ is the center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, with $v_F$ being the Fermi velocity, and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \\cdots$. It can be inferred that the potential barrier suppresses the transport of spin-singlet pairs while allowing spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis to pass through. As these spin-triplet pairs traverse the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers, the total phase they acquire determines the ground state of the Josephson junction. At the resonance peaks, the Josephson current primarily arises from the first harmonic in both the parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations. However, in perpendicular configurations, the second harmonic becomes more significant. In scenarios where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while allowing it to persist in the $\\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved."

In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle magnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers. Electrical transport measurements demonstrate a quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. For m 1 and m 2, the sample exhibits the well-quantized C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states, respectively. For 1 m 2, we observe a monotonic decrease in Hall resistance from h/e2 to h/2e2 with increasing m, accompanied by a peak in the longitudinal resistance. The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between the top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers. Our findings provide a scalable strategy for engineering QAH devices with a tunable Chern number. This approach enables precise control and enhanced functionality in chiral edge current-based electronic devices."

This paper investigates, both analytically and numerically, two types of excitations generated by the flow of a Lee-Huang-Yang quantum fluid past an obstacle: linear radiation and oblique dark solitons. We show that wave crests of linear radiation can be accurately described by the proper modification of the Kelvin original theory, while the oblique dark soliton solution is obtained analytically by transformation of the 1D soliton solution to the obstacle's reference frame. A comparison between analytical predictions and numerical simulations demonstrates good agreement, validating our theoretical approach."

However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. To address this challenge, we compute the DSF from a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion to frequency moments. We focus on nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models with spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We provide comprehensive benchmarks and consider a variety of frustrated two- and three-dimensional antiferromagnets as applications. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for the S=1 pyrochlore material NaCaNi2F7. An open-source numerical implementation for arbitrary lattice geometries is also provided."

Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions."

We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2 and 1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under {https://github.com/bsbierski/Dyn-HTE}.

An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function."

This feature sheds new light on the collective dynamics of Dirac magnons and their interactions. We further compare the honeycomb case with a triangular Bravais lattice, relevant for ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, and show that both systems lack singular features while displaying quite distinct thermal trends."

On the way towards generating standardized CDWs into z-cut bulk LN crystals with controllable geometry and electrical properties, we have encountered setbacks recently: Although the first preparation step, i.e., the established UV-light-assisted liquid-electrode poling, reliably creates fully penetrating hexagonal domains with the DWs being aligned almost parallel to the polarization axis, the second step in the DW 'conductivity-enhancement' process through post-growth voltage ramping, resulted in randomly-shaped DWs as reflected in their different current-voltage (I-V) characteristics even after having applied the same process parameters. To clarify this phenomenon, we present here an \\textit{in-situ} and time-resolved second-harmonic-generation (SHG) microscopy investigation of DW samples of different sizes, monitoring the DW evolution during that critical voltage ramping, which allowed us to reconstruct the 3D DW shapes both prior to and after the enhancement process. As a result, we are able to map the temporal changes of the local DW inclination angle $\\alpha$, and to quantify the DW velocity. As a consequence, we need to re-assess and re-think the origin of the DW conductivity (DWC) in LN: The hitherto assumed simple connection between $\\alpha$ and the DWC can not be generalized, since point defects accumulating along DWs act as extra sources for charge carrier trapping/release, significantly contributing to the DW current."

This is consistent with the lack of inversion symmetry that allows for the existence of Weyl nodes. Here, we employ density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory, which is state-of-the-art for strongly correlated materials, and study the topology of CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$. We find five inequivalent Weyl nodes of either type I or II, each having either eight or sixteen symmetry-related replicas. These Weyl nodes bridge the Kondo insulating gap, which is a direct but not an indirect gap. The Weyl points closest to the Fermi level are situated only 0.5 meV below it, and have a very flat dispersion. Our ab initio results establish CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ as a model system for investigating the interplay between strong electronic correlations and nontrivial topology. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for future studies of quantum transport and interaction-driven topological phases in heavy-fermion systems."

Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\\pi/4,\\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\\mu\\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM."

The underlying physics of this issue is rooted in unstable surface charges and intrinsic inhomogeneity of surface potential caused by spontaneous polarization (SP) in commercial semi-insulating silicon carbide (SiC) devices. In this work, we found that coating SiC surfaces with an ultrathin zinc oxide layer immobilizes the dangling surface charges in place and balances the natural electric field of the material, ensuring stable resistance even at extreme voltages up to 1000 V. The resulting SiC resistor maintains a record-high resistance of one peta-ohm (10^15 {\\Omega}) with negligible voltage fluctuations, outperforming conventional options. Additionally, these devices can switch states when exposed to light or heat, making them dual-purpose tools for ultra-sensitive measurements and sensors. This breakthrough combines high stability, scalability for mass production, and multifunctionality, opening doors to next-generation precision technologies in fields like quantum sensing and environmental monitoring."

In this work, we investigate the critical fingerprints appearing in these key thermodynamical quantities for a mean-field critical system undergoing a finite-time cycle, starting from a thermal state at a generic inverse temperature. In contrast to non-zero dimensional many-body systems, the presence of a mean-field critical point in a finite-time cycle leads to constant irreversible work even in the limit of infinitely slow driving. This links with the fact that a slow finite-time cycle results in a constant amount of squeezing, which enables us to derive analytical expressions for the work statistics and irreversible entropy, depending solely on the mean-field critical exponents and the functional form of the control parameter near the critical point. We find that the probability of observing negative work values, corresponding to negative irreversible entropy, is inversely proportional to the time the system remains near to the critical point, and this trend becomes less pronounced the lower the temperature of the initial thermal state. Finally, we determine the irreversibility traits under squeezing generation at zero-temperature using the relative entropy of coherence."

However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves \"conflicted\" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD < 2 {\\AA}) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation."

Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\\sqrt{\\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\\sqrt{\\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter is described via two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density and initial quantum state. For initial thermal states of the two reservoirs at different temperatures, the standard approach based on the knowledge of the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object at the quantum emitter position cannot be employed. We map the two reservoirs to a single equivalent reservoir with a temperature-dependent effective spectral density and initially in its vacuum state, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology"

The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional block disordered subwavelength resonator systems subject to non-reciprocal damping, induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation against the non-Hermitian skin effect, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials."

Here, the authors explore how disorder affects a strain-tuned bicritical point associated with the meeting of two non-symmetry-related continuous phase transitions in an orthorhombic material. They find evidence for an emergent pseudo-tetragonal symmetry proximate to the bicritical point, which, despite negligible changes in the structural orthorhombicity, occurs for a smaller value of the critical strain and extends over a wider range of tuning parameters than for the pristine material.
