      "summary": "Topological semimetals are considered important for future developments of ultralow-power fast electronics that utilize spin rather than charge for storing and processing information. Weyl semimetals are important member of this family, as they host Fermi arcs, along which the spin of electrons is locked to their momenta. In most previously studied materials, the Fermi arcs are in very close proximity to other features of the band structure (e.g., NbAs), which makes it difficult to study these objects. Here, the authors find that in t -PtBi 2 , the arcs are well separated from other features, which allows a conclusive demonstration that they are indeed disconnected contours in the momentum space, spanning two Weyl points of opposing polarity. Since the Fermi arcs in PtBi 2 are the main feature in the Fermi surface, it is likely that it would be easier to harness their unusual spin properties. [Phys. Rev.

      "summary": "Non-Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts in Hermitian systems. A well-known example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non-Hermitian lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary-localized loss probability-a phenomenon that requires not only non-Hermitian band topology but also the closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the non-Hermitian edge burst in a classical-wave metamaterial: a lossy nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non-Hermitian band topology; the latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non-Hermitian band topology and other physical properties in non-Hermitian systems."

      "summary": "Enhancing the fracture toughness of diamond while preserving its hardness is a significant challenge. Traditional toughening strategies have primarily focused on modulating the internal microstructural units of diamonds, including adjustments to stacking sequences, faults, nanotwinning, and the incorporation of amorphous phases, collectively referred to as intrinsic toughening. Here, we introduce an extrinsic toughening strategy to develop an unparalleled tough diamond composite with complex and abundant sp2-sp3 bonding interfaces, by incorporating highly dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the gaps of diamond grains to create a three-dimensional (3D) continuous MWCTNs network-toughen heterogeneous structure. The resultant composite exhibits a hardness of approximately 91.6 GPa and a fracture toughness of roughly 36.4 MPa.m1/2, which is six times higher than that of synthetic diamond and even surpasses that of tungsten alloys, surpassing the benefits achievable through intrinsic toughening alone. The remarkable toughening behavior can be attributed to the formation of numerous mixed sp2-sp3 bonding interactions at the 3D continuous network MWCNTs/diamond interfaces, which facilitate efficient energy dissipation. Our 3D continuous network heterogeneous structure design provides an effective approach for enhancing the fracture toughness of superhard materials, offering a new paradigm for the advanced composite ceramics."

      "summary": "We employ a general method, known as anomaly-matching, to derive new no-go theorems of fermionic lattice models. For our main result, we show that time-reversal invariant 3+1d lattice systems (such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals) can never admit a lone low-energy symmetry-protected Dirac fermion (or node), i.e., it must always come in higher muliplets or be fine-tuned. This theorem holds for both non-interacting and interacting systems as long as the electromagnetic $U(1)_{V,{\\rm UV}}$ symmetry is a normal subgroup of the microscopic symmetry group $G_{\\mathrm{UV}}$; a condition that is ubiquitous in physical $U(1)_{V,{\\rm UV}}$ preserving lattice models. To show that our theorems are tight, we also explore both well-known and new systems that are converses of the no-go theorem, obtained by forfeiting certain assumptions such as a broken time-reversal symmetry (magnetic Weyl semimetal), a non-compact non-on-site $U(1)$ (almost local Dirac node model), no-symmetry protection (fine-tuned Dirac semimetal), or multiple low-energy Dirac nodes (time-reversal invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals). We will also explicitly demonstrate that, while this theorem strictly prohibits single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac node, it does allow for other odd numbers of Dirac nodes under certain circumstances, such as three Dirac nodes in the Fu-Kane-Mele diamond lattice model. This is akin to the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem for an odd number of differently-charged chiral fermions, whose lattice realizations are allowed if certain anomaly cancellation conditions are met."

The impurity exhibits four phases $\\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment $\\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\\rm imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows monotonically from $\\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\\ln 2$, saturating to $\\ln 2$ at high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\\ln 2$, with some intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\\delta \\to 0$. These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram."

For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J>0$): a \\textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\\ln 2$ at $T \\to \\infty$ to $0$ at $T\\to 0$; and an \\textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\\ln 2$ as $T \\to \\infty$ and to $0$ as $T \\to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J<0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}\\to \\ln 2$ as $T \\to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \\textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}=\\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J<0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results."

      "summary": "Mobile ions play a key role in the degradation of perovskite solar cells, making their quantification essential for enhancing device stability. Various electrical measurements have been applied to characterize mobile ions. However, discerning between different ionic migration processes can be difficult. Furthermore, multiple measurements at different temperatures are usually required to probe different ions and their activation energies. Here, we demonstrate a new characterization technique based on measuring the thermally activated ion current (TAIC) of perovskite solar cells. The method reveals density, diffusion coefficient, and activation energy of mobile ions within a single temperature sweep and offers an intuitive way to distinguish mobile ion species. We apply the TAIC technique to quantify mobile ions of MAPbI3 and triple-cation perovskite solar cells. We find a higher activation energy and a lower diffusion coefficient in the triple-cation devices. TAIC measurements are a simple yet powerful tool to better understand ion migration in perovskite solar cells."

      "summary": "Josephson junctions formed by finite-length topological superconductors host four Majorana zero modes when the phase difference between the superconductors is $\\varphi=\\pi$ and their length is larger than the Majorana localization length. While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights, thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions hosting Majorana zero modes."

      "summary": "Non-equilibrium thermodynamics far from equilibrium is investigated in terms of a generalized ``Nambu dynamics'' (termed Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)); NNET consists of Nambu dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians and an entropy causing dissipation. It is shown that a general complex non-linear non-equilibrium system far from equilibrium can be reduced to a simple NNET, on the basis of an existence proposition of NNET. This proposition is, however, proved only formally, so that there may exist various obstacles to destroy it. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics studied in this article is quite general, including the case in which the product of dynamical and affinity forces forms a higher-order mixed tensor."

We confirm the validity of this combination on TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and TbCo$_5$, and then show how the many-body correction adjusts the calculated magnetic anisotropy energy of SmCo$_5$ to match experiment.

      "summary": "The band gap, a key concept in solid-state physics, is traditionally explained by the Bragg diffraction of electron waves in the periodic potential of a crystal. Although widely accepted, this framework raises fundamental issues in one-dimensional systems, where Bragg diffraction-which requires multidirectional wave interactions-reduces to simple interference, thus failing to explain band gap formation. In this paper, we introduce an alternative theory that does not rely on Bragg reflection. Using the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for Bloch waves, we consider the crystal lattice as a discrete set of observation points. This discreteness introduces a sampling-like constraint analogous to the Nyquist frequency in signal processing. We show that when the electron wavenumber changes under a periodic potential while the lattice spacing remains fixed, a band gap naturally emerges as a sampling effect. By constructing an energy diagram that incorporates this effect, we reveal that the band gap originates from both the wavenumber change and the role of the lattice as discrete samplers, leading the energy curve to exhibit translational and mirror symmetries with respect to the Nyquist wavenumber. This approach provides a novel, physically grounded explanation of band gap formation and can be naturally extended to higher dimensions."

While both have been extensively studied in classical-wave systems, their coexistence and controllable transition within a single platform remain largely unexplored. Meanwhile, implementing three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings, which is crucial for realizing a broad class of higher-dimensional topological phases, continues to pose significant experimental challenges. Here, we experimentally realize three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings and demonstrate that tuning the dimerized spin-orbit coupling strength enables both the coexistence of and a controllable switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological insulator phases. By engineering a three-dimensional circuit metamaterial, we synthesize the required spin-orbit interactions and observe hallmark signatures of both phases: frequency spectroscopy reveals the Fermi arcs, while local density of states measurements identify the topological corner modes. Interestingly, the corner mode degeneracy doubles compared to that in the canonical Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, signaling an enriched topological structure. Our study establishes a fundamental connection between two paradigmatic topological phases and paves the way for further exploring spin-orbit-coupling induced exotic higher-dimensional topological phases."

Furthermore, we uncover a marginal metallic phase emerging between weak antilocalization and Anderson insulation -- a transition that defies conventional metal-insulator transitions by lacking an isolated critical point -- where both conductance and normalized localization length exhibit scale invariance, independent of system size. The half-quantized Hall metal and the marginal metallic phase challenge existing localization theories and provide insights into disorder-driven topological phase transitions in magnetic topological insulators, opening avenues for exploring quantum materials and next-generation electronic devices."

      "summary": "In recent years, charge-channel orders in strongly correlated metals have attracted great attention. Famous examples are the electronic nematic orders in cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and Star-of-David order in kagome metals. Critical phenomena and unconventional superconductivity arising from fluctuations of such charge-channel orders are central issues today; however, the essential role is played by the vertex corrections, which are the many-body effects that are dropped in conventional mean-field type approximations. To solve this difficulty, in this study, we propose the Bethe-Salpeter equation theory to evaluate electron-electron interactions in two dimensional Hubbard models. This method satisfies the criteria of the Baym-Kadanoff conserving approximation. Here, we find that an attractive interaction in the charge channel emerges from the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex corrections that describe the interference processes among spin fluctuations. Applying this method to the square-lattice Hubbard model, we reveal that the cooperation of attractive charge fluctuations and repulsive spin fluctuations yields high-$T_c$ $d$-wave superconductivity together with enhanced effective mass. These results naturally explain the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, where strong-coupling $d$-wave superconductivity appears near the charge-order quantum critical point. The theory can also be applied to multi-orbital Hubbard models, like iron-based and nickelate superconductors, suggesting broad potential for future applications."

This approach utilizes PMMA masks, combined with a water-dissoluble coating as a sacrificial layer, to ensure that sensitive materials are processed without exposure to harmful environmental conditions. The entire fabrication process is carried out in a glove box, employing dry techniques that avoid air, solvents, and heat exposure, culminating in an encapsulation step. We demonstrate the utility of this method by fabricating and characterizing K2Cr3As3 and WTe2 devices, a one- and two-dimensional material, respectively. The results show that our technique preserves the integrity of the materials, provides excellent contact interfaces, and is broadly applicable to a range of sensitive materials."

The three phases are found to be ferromagnetic metals. In particular, the {\\alpha}-phase PtMnBi shows a high TC up to 802 K and a relatively large Gilbert damping of 0.085. Additionally, the {\\gamma}-phase PtMnBi possesses a non-negligible AHC, reaching 203 {\\Omega}-1cm-1 at the Fermi level. To evaluate its potential in nanoscale devices, we further investigate the {\\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films. The Gilbert dampings of {\\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films varies with film thickness and we attribute this variation to the distinct band structures at the high-symmetry point {\\Gamma}, which arise from differences in film thickness. Moreover, the 1-layer (1L) {\\alpha}-phase thin film retains robust ferromagnetism (TC = 688 K) and shows enhanced Gilbert damping (0.14) and AHC (1116 {\\Omega}-1cm-1) compared to the bulk. Intriguingly, under a 2% in-plane biaxial compressive strain, the Gilbert damping of 1L {\\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin film increases to 0.17 and the AHC reaches 2386 {\\Omega}-1cm-1. The coexistence of giant Gilbert damping and large AHC makes {\\alpha}-phase PtMnBi a compelling platform for practical spintronic applications, and highlights the potential of half-Heusler alloys in spintronic device design."

Their combination of robust structural integrity, superior mechanical properties, and exceptional irradiation tolerance makes them promising candidates for use in advanced superconducting technologies. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation on the superconductivity of equiatomic entropy-stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25. The material shows bulk superconductivity (transition temperature = 8K) with a high upper critical field of 11.94T. Interestingly, both the electronic band structure and specific heat data point toward unconventional multiband superconductivity. Our ab initio calculations reveal Dirac-like band crossings close to the Fermi level, with certain degeneracies persisting even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, suggesting a possible interplay between topological electronic states and the observed unconventional superconductivity. Remarkably, the critical current density exceeds the benchmark of 10^5 A/cm2, surpassing all previously reported as-cast entropy-stabilized superconductors. This high critical current density is likely attributed to strong flux pinning at the grain boundaries, facilitated by extreme intrinsic lattice distortion. Taken together, the demonstrated dynamical stability, excellent metallicity, potential to host unconventional superconductivity, and exceptionally high critical current density highlight the potential of entropy-stabilized alloys as a platform for exploring the confluence of disorder, topology, and unconventional superconductivity."

The effect arises from the Berry connection polarizability dipole of valley electrons and is permissible in both inversion-symmetric and inversion-asymmetric materials. We demonstrate that the response tensor is connected to the intrinsic nonlinear valley Hall conductivity through a generalized Mott relation, with the two being directly proportional at low temperatures, scaled by the Lorenz number. We elucidate the symmetry constraints governing this effect and develop a theory for its nonlocal measurement, revealing a nonlocal second-harmonic signal with a distinct $\\rho^2$ scaling. This signal comprises two scaling terms, with their ratio corresponding to the square of the thermopower normalized by the Lorenz number. Key characteristics are demonstrated using a tilted Dirac model and first-principles calculations on bilayer WTe$_2$. Possible extrinsic contributions and alternative experimental detection methods, e.g., by valley pumping and by nonreciprocal directional dichroism, are discussed. These findings underscore the significance of band quantum geometry on electron dynamics and establish a theoretical foundation for nonlinear valley caloritronics."

While conventional binary probabilistic computing has been realized, implementing more advantageous multi-value probabilistic computing (MPC) remains a challenge. Here, we report the realization of MPC by leveraging the thermally activated diffusion of magnetic skyrmions through an effectively non-flat energy landscape defined by a discrete number of pinning sites. The time-averaged spatial distribution of the diffusing skyrmions directly realizes a discrete probability distribution, which is tunable by current-generated spin-orbit torques, and can be quantified by non-perturbative electrical measurements. Even a very straightforward implementation with global tuning, already allows us to demonstrate the softmax computation - a core function in artificial intelligence. As a key advance, we demonstrate invertible logic without the need to create a network of probabilistic devices, offering major scalability advantages. Our proof of concept can be generalized to multiple skyrmions and can accommodate multiple locally tunable inputs and outputs using magnetic tunnel junctions, potentially enabling the representation of highly complex distribution functions."

      "summary": "Inverse design of morphing slender structures with programmable curvature has significant applications in various engineering fields. Most existing studies formulate it as an optimization problem, which requires repeatedly solving the forward equations to identify optimal designs. Such methods, however, are computationally intensive and often susceptible to local minima issues. In contrast, solving the inverse problem theoretically, which can bypass the need for optimizations, is highly efficient yet remains challenging, particularly for cases involving arbitrary boundary conditions (BCs). Here, we develop a systematic theoretical framework, termed inverse elastica, for the direct determination of the undeformed configuration from a target deformed shape along with prescribed BCs. Building upon the classical elastica, inverse elastica is derived by supplementing the geometric equations of undeformed configurations. The framework shows three key features: reduced nonlinearity, solution multiplicity, and inverse loading. These principles are demonstrated through two representative models: an analytical solution for a two-dimensional arc and a numerical continuation study of the inverse loading of a three-dimensional helical spring. Furthermore, we develop a theory-assisted optimization strategy for cases in which the constrains of the undeformed configurations cannot be directly formulated as BCs. Using this strategy, we achieve rational inverse design of complex spatial curves and curve-discretized surfaces with varying Gaussian curvatures. Our theoretical predictions are validated through both discrete elastic rod simulations and experiments."

      "summary": "Understanding hydrogen diffusion is critical for improving the reliability and performance of oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs), where hydrogen plays a key role in carrier modulation and bias instability. In this work, we investigate hydrogen diffusion in amorphous IGZO ($a$-IGZO) and $c$-axis aligned crystalline IGZO (CAAC-IGZO) using machine learning interatomic potential molecular dynamics (MLIP-MD) simulations. We construct accurate phase-specific MLIPs by fine-tuning SevenNet-0, a universal pretrained MLIP, and validate the models against a comprehensive dataset covering hydrogen-related configurations and diffusion environments. Hydrogen diffusivity is evaluated over 650--1700 K, revealing enhanced mobility above 750 K in $a$-IGZO due to the glassy matrix, while diffusion at lower temperatures is constrained by the rigid network. Arrhenius extrapolation of the diffusivity indicates that hydrogen in $a$-IGZO can reach the channel/insulator interface within $10^{4}$ seconds at 300--400 K, likely contributing to negative bias stress-induced device degradation. Trajectory analysis reveals that long-range diffusion in $a$-IGZO is enabled by a combination of hydrogen hopping and flipping mechanisms. In CAAC-IGZO, hydrogen exhibits high in-plane diffusivity but severely restricted out-of-plane transport due to a high energy barrier along the $c$-axis. This limited vertical diffusion in CAAC-IGZO suggests minimal impact on bias instability. This work bridges the atomic-level hydrogen transport mechanism and device-level performance in oxide TFTs by leveraging large-scale MLIP-MD simulations."

Yet the underlying reversal mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the challenges of probing ultrafast, non-equilibrium spin dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that typical magneto-optical experiments can be leveraged to access the time evolution of the spin accumulation generated within a magnetic multilayer following an ultrafast laser excitation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the final magnetic state of the free-layer in a spin-valve is mainly dictated by the ultrafast dynamics of the reference-layer magnetization. Our results disentangle magnetization and spin transport dynamics within a multilayer stack and identify demagnetization and remagnetization-driven spin accumulation as the key mechanism for all-optical switching. These findings establish new design principles for ultrafast spintronic devices based on tailored spin current engineering."

The growth morphology strongly depends on the growth temperature, evolving from fractal to dendritic and eventually to compact dendritic skeletal islands, reflecting changes in the underlying surface diffusion processes. MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(110) constitutes a three-lattice system, giving rise to a super-moir\\'e pattern --a moir\\'e of moir\\'es. Due to the involvement of lattices of differing symmetries and the partial electronic transparency of Gr, a \"virtual\" moir\\'e formed by MnBr$_2$ and Ir(110) contributes to the super-moir\\'e formation. Ab initio calculations play a crucial role in understanding the complexity of super-moir\\'e.

      "summary": "We study compression of coesite to pressures above 35 GPa, substantially beyond the equilibrium transition pressure to octahedral phases (8 GPa to stishovite). Experiments at room temperature showed that up to 30 GPa the metastable coesite structure develops only minor displacive changes (coesite-II and coesite-III) while the Si atoms remain 4-coordinated. Beyond 30 GPa, reconstructive transformations start, following different pathways from the complex structure of coesite. Besides amorphization, two different crystalline outcomes were observed. One is formation of defective high-pressure octahedral phases (Hu et al., 2015) and another one is formation of unusual and complex dense phases coesite-IV and coesite-V with Si atoms in 4-fold, 5-fold and 6-fold coordination (Bykova et al., 2018). Capturing these structural transformations computationally represents a challenge. Here we show that employing metadynamics with Si-O coordination number and volume as generic collective variables in combination with a machine-learning based ACE potential (Erhard et al., 2024), one naturally observes all three mentioned pathways, resulting in the phases observed experimentally. We describe the atomistic mechanisms along the transformation pathways. While the pathway to coesite-IV is simpler, the transformation to octahedral phases involves two steps: first, a hcp sublattice of O atoms is formed where Si atoms occupy octahedral positions but the octahedra chains do not form a regular pattern. In the second step, the Si atoms order and the chains develop a more regular arrangement. We predict that the pathway to coesite-IV is preferred at room temperature, while at 600 K the formation of octahedral phases is more likely."

      "summary": "Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of thermodynamically stable hydrides. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of $T_{\\rm c}$. Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic thermodynamically stable hydrides with $T_{\\rm c}$ above 4.2 K and reach a maximum $T_{\\rm c}$ of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance."

Due to the divergence of the effective field at a BP, classical micromagnetics fails to adequately describe BP dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a regularized micromagnetic model in which the magnetization vector can vary in length but not exceed a threshold value. More specifically, the magnetization is treated as an order parameter constrained to a S3-sphere. This constraint respects fundamental properties of local spin expectation values in quantum systems. We derive the corresponding regularized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the analogue of the Thiele equation describing the steady motion of spin textures under various external stimuli. We demonstrate the applicability of our theory by modeling the dynamics of several magnetic textures containing BPs, including domain walls in nanowires, chiral bobbers, and magnetic dipolar strings. The presented results extend micromagnetic theory by incorporating a regularized description of BP dynamics."

Many developmental processes are driven by convergence-extension flows where the tissue has an emergent negative shear modulus and viscosity. This exotic rheology is generated through active T1 transitions where rearrangements are opposite the applied stress direction. Here, we introduce a mean-field elasto-plastic model which shows convergence-extension, based on the Hebraud-Lequeux model, that includes both passive and active elastic elements with opposite stress responses. We find that the introduction of active elements profoundly changes the rheology. Beyond a threshold fraction of active elements, it gives rise to non-monotonic flow curves and negative stresses at positive strain rates. Controlled by the active fraction and the stress diffusion rate, we find both yield stress materials and fluids, with either a positive or negative yield stress or viscosity. These features are characteristic of metamaterials, and highlight how biology uses disordered, active materials with exotic rheology."

We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0.

Our analysis of the robust PHE signal (~3.8 {\\mu}{\\Omega} cm at 2 K and 8 T) unveils a distinct interplay of mechanisms.

      "summary": "The design of hydrogels that combine mechanical robustness with dynamic reconfigurability remains a fundamental challenge, as increasing crosslink dissociation rates compromise network integrity. This limitation is addressed through the incorporation of an associative crosslink exchange into DNA-based supramolecular hydrogels, enabling the decoupling of network relaxation behavior from crosslink stability. The hydrogels are constructed from enzyme-synthesized single-stranded DNA that self-assembles via hybridization between complementary domains. These crosslinks can reorganize through dissociative melting or associative strand displacement reaction, yielding networks with tunable relaxation timescales spanning over three orders of magnitude. Rheological measurements and thermodynamic modeling confirm that associative exchange facilitates efficient stress dissipation without diminishing rupture strength or thermal stability. In contrast, dissociative systems inherently trade increased dynamics with mechanical weakening. This decoupling is achieved through the implementation of a catalytic reorganization pathway governed by the composition of the sample, independently of crosslink strength. These findings establish the mechanism of reorganization as a key design parameter for engineering adaptive soft materials that combine resilience and responsiveness."

Their unique crystal chemistries and structural anisotropies make them attractive for applications ranging from sensors and flexoelectric devices to drug delivery and catalysis. To unlock their full potential, it is critical to understand their thickness-dependent mechanical properties within the family of 2D silicates. In this study, we investigate the nanomechanical and frictional behaviors of two structurally distinct natural silicates: layered Biotite and chain-structured Rhodonite. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we found that Rhodonite exhibits nearly ten times higher adhesion force and modulus response compared to Biotite. Despite this, Biotite demonstrates superior frictional performance, with ultrathin (5 nm) flakes showing a remarkably low coefficient of friction ($\\sim 0.6 \\times 10^{-3}$) versus Rhodonite ($\\sim 3.6 \\times 10^{-3}$). To further elucidate interlayer adhesion, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Hubbard correction were employed.

With the aid of density functional theory calculations, symmetry analysis, and model studies in this configuration space, we demonstrate the generic presence of spin-split of the antiferromagnetic bands in the momentum space. This is indicative of a wider class of quasi-altermagnetic materials, augmenting the set of ideal altermagnetic systems. Furthermore, we show that while pristine MnTe does not show anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) with out-of-plane magnetization, suitable doping can be carried out to obtain finite and varied AHC. Our predictions of quasi-altermagnetism and doping driven tailored AHC have the potential to open up as-yet-unexplored directions in this developing field."

      "summary": "We show that strong interactions combined with band-dependent imaginary vector potentials give rise to boundary localization of particle-hole pairs, which we term the excitonic skin effect. In a bilayer system with layer-specific gain/loss and an in-plane magnetic field, excitons experience a net imaginary vector potential, resulting in directional amplification of particle-hole pairs. Including nearest-neighbor interactions leads to a non-Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model, where the pairing effects grow exponentially with the size of the system, revealing a unique form of critical skin effect in interacting systems. Our framework applies to both atomic and electronic platforms and is directly testable in current experiments. These results also provide a route to explore non-Hermitian analogs of tensor gauge fields."

The topologically protected edge states of this system are composed of coherent superpositions of single-magnon excitations and two magnon bound states.

We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures."

Such coarsening is universally driven by diffusive relaxation toward equilibrium. Here, we discover an inertial counterpart - wave coarsening - in active elastic media, where vibrations emerge and spontaneously grow in wavelength, period, and amplitude, before a globally synchronized state called a time crystal forms. We observe wave coarsening in one- and two-dimensional solids and capture its dynamical scaling. We further arrest the process by breaking momentum conservation and reveal a far-from-equilibrium nonlinear analogue to chiral topological edge modes. Our work unveils the crucial role of symmetries in the formation of time crystals and opens avenues for the control of nonlinear vibrations in active materials."

Odd transport manifests in tensors that describe linear relations between fluxes and gradients that drive them, particularly when parity and time-reversal symmetries are broken. In this work, we identify such odd properties to be a subset of a broader class of major-symmetry-breaking behaviors, which we term ``anomalous.\" We develop a classification of anomalous properties described by $2^\\mathrm{nd}$ and $4^\\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in anisotropic 2D materials that maintain discrete rotational and reflection symmetries, characterized by the 17 wallpaper groups. To this end, we present representation theorems for these tensors, identifying which components are constrained for specific spatial symmetries and thereby allowing materials to be grouped into classes that exhibit anomalous responses or not. We focus our discussion on $2^\\mathrm{nd}$ order tensors in the context of electrical resistivity and on $4^\\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in the context of viscosity and elasticity. These findings are broadly applicable to the study of novel emergent material properties. To illustrate this, we discuss implications of our findings for two very different 2D materials that have recently garnered attention in condensed matter physics: knitted fabrics and twisted bilayer graphene."

Fisher later extended this approach to complex temperatures, and subsequent generalizations introduced other control parameters, such as the crystal field. In previous works [Moueddene et al, J. Stat. Mech. (2024) 023206; Phys. Rev. E 110, 064144 (2024)] we applied this framework to the two- and three-dimensional Blume-Capel model -- a system with a rich phase structure where a second-order critical line meets a first-order line at a tricritical point. We showed that the scaling of Lee-Yang, Fisher, and crystal-field zeros yields accurate critical exponents even for modest lattice sizes. In the present study, we extend this analysis and demonstrate that simulations need not be performed exactly at the nominal transition point to obtain reliable exponent estimates. Strikingly, small system sizes are sufficient, which not only improves methodological efficiency but also advances the broader goal of reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale computational studies."

Antiferromagnets support both right-handed and left-handed magnon modes, which we treat as positive and negative frequency branches, analogous to electrons and holes in semiconductors. Using a two-sublattice model with a minimal exchange interaction scheme, we derive the temperature-dependent spin-wave spectrum and evaluate the associated thermal spin pumping coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the competition between left- and right-handed modes gives rise to a compensation temperature, where the net thermally generated spin current vanishes. Importantly, we show that this compensation point does not necessarily coincide with the crossing of magnon dispersion branches. While previous research considers a detailed microscopic model including all magnetic sublattices and exchange couplings, our approach demonstrates that key features of mode-resolved spin transport can be captured by a simplified and analytically transparent model. These findings advance the understanding of spin-caloritronic phenomena in ferrimagnets and offer new perspectives for the design of chiral magnon-based spintronic devices."

We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust particles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for the chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding energies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies, and Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the binding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local minima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found for each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8 eV) > Al (12.8 eV) > Ca (12.7 eV) > C (9.5 eV) > O (8.1 eV) > N (6.2 eV) > Fe (6.0 eV) > S (5.2 eV) > Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding energies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a log-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have large binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust particles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N, O, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding energies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated with dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM), suggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We estimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to 3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime. These binding energies on silicate dust grains, estimated from first principles for the first time, provide invaluable input to models of dust evolution and dust-catalyzed chemical reactions in the interstellar medium."

We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system."

On the other hand, the time dependence of logarithmic negativity shows that the non-locality can destroy the quantum correlation. These findings suggest that the quantum thermalization induced by the non-local Hamiltonian does not require the quantum chaoticity of the system."

A natural question arises: up to what distances electrons in a periodic potential can be considered as constituting an effective closed quantum system? And what is the cause of decoherence? To answer some of these questions, the seminal theory of Ovchinnikov and Erikhman of decoherence due to ionic motion is revisited and an oversight of the authors is corrected. Correct conditions for decoherence to occur are worked out. Length scale up to which the motion of ions remains coherent is also calculated. Finally, a realistic physical picture is discussed."

      "summary": "The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific topological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts."

When the oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due to its dependence on various circuit elements."

Engineered human myocardium (EHM) is tested clinically as a first-in-class product for sustainable remuscularization in patients with advanced heart failure. Current EHM production procedure from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells, is time consuming and involves thin constructs. Here, I introduce 4D-DLP-printed foldable scaffolds with potential to create modular cylindrical cardiac bricks. This enables self-assembly into thicker and aligned sarcomeres with synchronous contractility mimicking a native myocardium. When optimized and integrated with cryopreservation protocols, the biomanufacturing and biobanking of these cellular building blocks may overcome current EHM limitations and advance translational regenerative therapies for myocardial infarction. The structure-material properties investigations into these new class of life building blocks paves the way for future medical breakthroughs."

      "summary": "Lattice Hamiltonians, which can be tuned between different topological phases, are known as important tools for understanding physical mechanism behind topological phase transitions. In this paper, we introduce a perturbed Color Code Hamiltonian with a rich phase structure which can be well matched to the mechanism of anyon condensation in the Color Code. We consider Color Code model defined on a three-colorable hexagonal lattice and add Ising interactions between spins corresponding to edges of the lattice. We show that Ising interactions play the role of physical factor for condensing anyons in the Color Code. In particular, corresponding to three different colors of edges in the hexagonal lattice, we consider three different coupling parameters. Then, we are able to condense anyons with different colors by tuning power of Ising interactions in the corresponding edges. In particular, we explicitly show that condensation of one type of anyons in the Color Code leads to a phase transition to the Toric Code state. On the other hand, by condensing two types of anyons, we observe a phase transition to a modified version of the Toric Code where partial set of anyons in the Toric Code are condensed and we call it a partially topological phase. Our main method for derivation of the above results is based on a suitable basis transformation on the main Hamiltonian in the sense that our model is mapped onto three decoupled transverse-field Ising models, corresponding to the three colors. We use the above mapping to analyze behavior of string order parameters as non-local indicators of topological order. We introduce three string order parameters that can well characterize different phases of the model. Specifically we give a simple description of the partially condensed phase by using string order parameters."

Integrated photonics offers a compact, parallel and ultra-fast information processing platform, specially suited for extreme learning machine (ELM) architectures. Here we experimentally demonstrate a chip-scale photonic ELM based on wave chaos interference in a stadium microcavity. By encoding the input information in the wavelength of an external single-frequency tunable laser source, we leverage the high sensitivity to wavelength of injection in such photonic resonators. We fabricate the microcavity with direct laser writing of SU-8 polymer on glass. A scattering wall surrounding the stadium operates as readout layer, collecting the light associated with the cavity's leaky modes. We report uncorrelated and aperiodic behavior in the speckles of the scattering barrier from a high resolution scan of the input wavelength. Finally, we characterize the system's performance at classification in four qualitatively different benchmark tasks. As we can control the number of output nodes of our ELM by measuring different parts of the scattering barrier, we demonstrate the capability to optimize our photonic ELM's readout size to the performance required for each task."

More recently, the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However, experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry as they require incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation inside a dilution refrigerator at Millikelvin temperatures, featuring electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in-situ tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level. By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness, we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of our chamber (V_chamber = 1l) is adaptable for integration of various optical and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and applied superfluid helium research."

      "summary": "Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description."

      "summary": "Understanding how quantum materials relax from metastable states poses a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. In the layered dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a uniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover from thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of quantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the microscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that single-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle transitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration rates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is rescaled as $T \\to h_x^n T$ with $n \\approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of first- and second-order single-particle processes. This enables us to reconstruct a microscopic relaxation pathway consisting of cyclical polaron leakage followed by cascades of tunneling events. Our results establish quantum simulation as a powerful tool for inferring real-space mechanisms in strongly correlated systems and demonstrate a concrete strategy for bridging effective spin models with the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum materials."

For all values of $\\alpha$, this transition manifests as a change from conventional Klein tunneling to anti-Klein tunneling."

The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant."

One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is \"trans-Planckian\", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior."

In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \\ll 1/\\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit."

At the same time, an interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction leads to a special type of collective excitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of spin polarization in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies of chiral-spin collective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the effect of electron correlation on the resonances in Edelstein and inverse-Edelstein effects in a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas and in a multi-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. While the chiral-spin modes involve both in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations of spins, we show that only the in-plane modes are responsible for the above resonances. In the multi-valley system, electron correlation splits the in-plane modes into two. We study the spectral weight distribution between the two modes over a large parameter space of intra- and inter-valley interactions. Finally, we demonstrate that using the chiral-spin modes one can get a resonant enhancement of charge-to-spin conversion and gain a directional control of the injected spins in the spin-pumping process, both of which are relevant to spintronics."

Compressing this network with applied pressure in ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ suppressed the structural transition temperature by constraining atomic rattling and inhibiting the shifts that define the structural modulation.

We found the transition temperature is smoothly depressed and disappears around 1.9 GPa.

Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases."

However, precise control over the microscopic pathways governing ultrafast charge transfer remains an open challenge. These pathways are intrinsically linked to charge transfer states with strongly delocalized wave functions that appear at various momenta in the Brillouin zone. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to investigate the possibility of steering carriers through specific charge transfer states in a prototypical WS2-graphene heterostructure. By selectively exciting electron-hole pairs at the K-point and close to the Q-point of WS2 with different pump photon energies, we find that charge separation is faster at higher excitation energies. We attribute this to distinct tunneling mechanisms dictated by the momentum where the initial excitation takes place. Our findings reveal that the microscopic pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in vdW heterostructures are highly sensitive to the excitation energy, an aspect that should be carefully considered when optimizing the performance of optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "We develop a machine-learned interatomic potential for AlCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloys (HEA) using a diverse set of structures from density functional theory calculated including magnetic effects. The potential is based on the computationally efficient tabulated version of the Gaussian approximation potential method (tabGAP) and is a general-purpose model for molecular dynamics simulation of the HEA system, with additional emphasis on radiation damage effects. We use the potential to study key properties of AlCrCuFeNi HEAs at different compositions, focusing on the FCC/BCC phase stability. Monte Carlo swapping simulations are performed to understand the stability and segregation of the HEA and reveal clear FeCr and Cu segregation. Close to equiatomic composition, a transition from FCC to BCC is detected, following the valence electron concentration stability rule. Furthermore, we perform overlapping cascade simulations to investigate radiation damage production and tolerance. Different alloy compositions show significant differences in defect concentrations, and all alloy compositions show enrichment of some elements in or around defects. We find that, generally, a lower Al content corresponds to lower defect concentrations during irradiation. Furthermore, clear short-range ordering is observed as a consequence of continued irradiation."

      "summary": "Matrix based quantum kinetic simulations have been widely used for the predictive modeling of electronic devices. Inelastic scattering from phonons and electrons are typically treated as higher order processes in these treatments, captured using mean-field approximations. Carrier multiplication in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), however, relies entirely on strongly inelastic impact ionization, making electron-electron scattering the dominant term requiring a rigorous, microscopic treatment. We go well beyond the conventional Born approximation for scattering to develop a matrix-based quantum kinetic theory for impact ionization, involving products of multiple Green's functions. Using a model semiconductor in a reverse-biased p-i-n configuration, we show how its calculated non-equilibrium charge distributions show multiplication at dead-space values consistent with energy-momentum conservation. Our matrix approach can be readily generalized to more sophisticated atomistic Hamiltonians, setting the stage for a fully predictive, `first principles' theory of APDs."

Although the QDET approach has been successful in predicting the electronic properties of several point defects, several limitations of the method remain. In this work, we propose multiple advances to the QDET formalism. We derive a double-counting correction that consistently treats the frequency dependence of the screened Coulomb interaction, and we illustrate the effect of including unoccupied orbitals in the active space. In addition, we propose a method to describe hybridization effects between the active space and the environment, and we compare the results of several impurity solvers, providing further insights into improving the reliability and applicability of the method. We present results for defects in diamond and for molecular qubits, including a detailed comparison with experiments."

In Thouless pumps - dimensionally reduced versions of the integer quantum Hall effect - quantization is dictated by the integer winding of single-band Wannier states. Here, we show that repulsive interactions can drive a transition from an integer- to a fractional-quantized Thouless pump (at fixed integer filling) by stabilizing a crystal of multi-band Wannier states, each with fractional winding. We numerically illustrate the concept in few-particle systems, and show that a dynamical Hartree-Fock ansatz can quantitatively reproduce the pumping phase diagram."

At temperatures far below $T_{\\rm c}$, however, fine structures in pre-equilibrium configurations trap random initial states, causing a pronounced delay in equilibration - an effect we identify as ultra-slow relaxation. This phenomenon is characterized by a self-divergence of the relative variance of equilibration times, which we propose as a previously unrecognized hallmark of first-order phase transitions."

We show that this technique allows us to extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that predicts the Hamiltonian parameters of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size.

For spatially homogeneous samples, we explicitly compute the critical points and minimizers of the modified Landau-de Gennes energy and show that the presence of NP eliminates the first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition, stabilises elusive biaxial phases over some temperature ranges, and that the symmetry of the NP boundary conditions or surface treatments dictates the bulk equilibrium phase at high temperatures. We also numerically demonstrate structural transitions from twisted helical director profiles to untwisted director profiles, in cholesteric-filled channel geometries, driven by the collective effects of the NPs and increasing temperature. These transitions are reversible upon lowering the temperature in sufficiently large domains, where thermal hysteresis can also be observed. This behaviour opens interesting avenues for tuning the optical properties of confined, nano-doped cholesteric systems."

Although different cleaning methods are often used for contamination removal, commonly used spectroscopic cleanliness assessment methods can leave the level of achieved cleanliness ambiguous. Despite two decades of research on 2D materials, the true cleanliness of the used samples is often left open to interpretation. In this work, freestanding monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are annealed at different temperatures in a custom-built ultra-high vacuum heating chamber, connected to a scanning transmission electron microscope via a vacuum transfer line, enabling atomically resolved cleanliness characterization as a function of annealing temperature, while eliminating the introduction of airborne contamination during sample transport. While annealing at 200 {\\deg}C already reduces contamination significantly, it is not until 400 {\\deg}C or higher, where over 90% of the free-standing monolayer areas are atomically clean. At this point, further contamination removal is mainly limited by defects in the material and metal contamination introduced during the sample transfer or growth. The achieved large, atomically clean areas can then be used for further nanoscale engineering steps or device processing, facilitating interaction with the material rather than contamination."

However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\\mathbf{K}/\\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\\sim$100\\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales.

Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate. The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation. Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2 stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter coupling."

We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems."

      "summary": "We investigate the interplay between structure and dynamics in two structurally distinct two-dimensional systems: a dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and a supercooled binary liquid. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover striking dynamical similarities despite their fundamentally different structural organizations. Both systems exhibit pronounced dynamic heterogeneities, as evidenced by the cage-trapping plateaus in the mean-squared displacement and the pronounced peaks in the non-Gaussian parameter. In both cases, we observe a strong correlation between local structural order and dynamic propensity, indicating similar structure-dynamics relationships, albeit driven by distinct microscopic mechanisms. Despite these parallels, their vibrational properties diverge: the DDQC exhibits multiple peaks linked to phason dynamics, while the supercooled liquid displays a characteristic boson peak. Analysis of vibrational eigenmodes shows that both systems exhibit extended modes at low frequencies. At high frequencies, however, the DDQC maintains a higher density of topological defects, reflecting its quasi-long-range order. Finally, we contextualize these findings by comparing both systems to a square crystal. While the dynamics appears similar across all three systems, the vibrational and topological features clearly distinguish the DDQC and glass from the crystalline state. These results underscore a surprising universality in dynamical behavior across structurally diverse systems and provide new insights into how structural organization shapes motion in soft-matter systems."

The map of the Fermi surface is of interest and importance to understand its properties. Here we present a study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and planar Hall effect (PHE) in HfTe2. The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal."

      "summary": "The mechanical properties of a solid, which relate its deformation to external applied forces, are key factors in enabling or disabling the use of an otherwise optimal material in any application, strongly influencing also its service lifetime. Intrinsic crystal deformation mechanisms, investigated experimentally on single crystals with low dislocation densities, have been studied theoretically through atomistic simulations, mainly focusing on lattice-induced instabilities. Here, instead, we employ density functional theory and a thermodynamic analysis to probe and analyze the way in which the electronic charge of crystalline solids (Cu, Al and diamond) responds to uniaxial strain and affects their mechanical properties. Indeed, despite the very simple nature of our models, and in the presence of minimal atomic displacements, we find that the stress strain curves of Cu and Al deviate from a simple linear elastic behavior. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the features of such curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order phase transitions, which originate from Van-Hove singularities of the electronic density of states crossing the Fermi level and electron redistribution within the solid, respectively."

The SymTFT is a $(d+1)$-dimensional topological field theory, which encodes the symmetry $\\mathcal{S}$ and the physical theory in terms of its boundary conditions. Our proposal applies quite generally to any finite symmetry $\\mathcal{S}$, including non-invertible, categorical symmetries. Mathematically, the topological defects of the SymTFT form the Drinfeld Center of the symmetry category $\\mathcal{S}$. Applied to invertible symmetries, we recover the result of Part I of this series of papers.

The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The present work concerns the detailed construction of a holographic model for a type-II s-wave superconductor defined on a 5-dimensional anisotropic rotating black hole. We examine the role of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of the superconductor model focusing on the condensate and the AC conductivity, for which we obtain closed formulas, using both analytical and numerical methods. The results reveal that the rotation is responsible for the appearance of a peak and for introducing an exponentially vanishing behavior in the high-frequency limit of the real component of the AC conductivity. Such a behavior aligns with that observed in high-temperature superconductor models and experiments, where the peak and vanishing behavior result from quasiparticle damping, suggesting a relation between the {\\it rotation of a black hole} and {\\it quasiparticle damping effects} due to impurities or defects in a superconducting material. This relation supplements the holographic dictionary of the gravity/Condensed Matter Theory correspondence. In addition, we provide a detailed construction of the vortex lattice presented in arXiv:2208.05988 and study its behavior as a function of an external uniform magnetic field. Once again, it is shown that the vortex lattice can be continuously deformed along with a change in the vortex population by virtue of the magnetic field, providing a promising avenue for holographically modeling the vortex lattice deformations observed in experimental studies with superconducting materials. As a concrete example, we describe both the vortex lattice deformation and the increment of the vortex population under the action of an external magnetic field in the LiFeAs type-II superconductor. These effects supplement those previously found for the FeSe type-II superconductor studied in arXiv:2208.05988."

The challenge of designing a quantum ODE algorithm is how to embed non-unitary dynamics into intrinsically unitary quantum circuits. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm for solving ODEs by harnessing open quantum systems. Specifically, we propose a novel technique called non-diagonal density matrix encoding, which leverages the inherent non-unitary dynamics of Lindbladians to encode general linear ODEs into the non-diagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design quantum algorithms with both theoretical simplicity and high performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters under a plausible input model. We also give applications of our algorithm including the Gibbs state preparations and the partition function estimations."

In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \\textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. We further show, using a perturbative approach that explicitly accounts for population dynamics, how the resulting switching dynamics can be observed and characterized in pump-probe experiments. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom."

In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while coexistence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry, i.e. the presence of agents who never change state, can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions."

We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment."

One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\\\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \\textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \\textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification."
