Such zero Gaussian curvature undulations create slide-type off-plane polarization, also mirrored in double-wall BN nanotubes, and a shear deformation potential that yields one-dimensional quantum-well-like states, together establishing “curvatronics” as a route to exotic phases.

Here, a previously unknown complex hydride, Mg 4 Pt 3 H 6 , is synthesized under moderate pressures, based on high-throughput calculations. Structural analysis confirms the structure, and electrical transport measurements indicate ambient-pressure superconductivity with T c ≈ 2.9 K, in agreement with predictions. These findings establish an emerging family of ambient-stable hydride superconductors, enriching ternary hydride chemistry and offering guidance for the design of hydrogen-rich superconductors.
