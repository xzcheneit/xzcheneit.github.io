      "summary": "Two-dimensional Chern insulators have emerged as crucial platforms for the realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and as such have attracted significant interest in spintronics and topological quantum physics due to their unique coexistence of spontaneous magnetization and nontrivial topological characteristics. Nonetheless, substantial challenges persist in such systems, encompassing spin entanglement and the possession of only one edge state (Chern number C=1), which significantly hinder their practical applications. Herein, we propose a novel two-dimensional ferromagnetic half-semi-Weyl-metal, monolayer Ti2TeSO, that exhibits exceptional electronic properties. Its majority spin channel possesses only a pair of symmetry-protected Weyl points at the Fermi level, while the states of minority one locate far away from the Fermi level. When spin-orbit coupling is included, a substantial band gap of ~ 92.8 meV is induced at the Weyl points. Remarkably, the emergence of dual dissipationless chiral edge channels and a quantized Hall conductivity plateau at 2e2/h collectively establish monolayer Ti2TeSO as a high-Chern-number insulator with C=2. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that valley polarization can be achieved and controlled through the application of strain and the manipulation of the direction of magnetization. The first-principles calculations, in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations, yield a Curie temperature of 161 K for monolayer Ti2TeSO, thereby indicating the plausibility of coexistence of valley polarization and topological states at elevated temperatures. These findings could provide a foundation for the development of multi-channels dissipationless transport devices and nonvolatile multistate memory architectures."

      "summary": "Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ short-ranged $\\textit{Ans\\\"atze}$, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a novel semi-Dirac spin liquid, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for future neutron-scattering studies on these materials."

      "summary": "In this article, we review some recent theoretical developments on potential high-temperature superconductors and unconventional metallic states that can arise from doping a spin-one Mott insulator in the $d^{8}$ valence. These studies are particularly relevant-though not limited-to the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We focus on a ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo lattice model with mobile electrons in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital coupled to the localized spin moments in $d_{z^2}$ orbital through a large Hund's coupling $J_H$. In the large $J_H$ limit, the model reduces to the type II t-J model with a mixture of spin-half singlon states and spin-one doublon states. We summarize DMRG results on the Luther-Emery liquid in one dimensional chain and two-leg ladder. Then we mainly focus on bilayer square lattice and show that a large inter-layer coupling $J_\\perp$ of $d_{z^2}$ orbital can induce strong inter-layer pairing of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong $J_\\perp$ limit, a kinetic-energy driven high $T_c$ superconductivity is demonstrated in an ideal model with only a single hopping term. Furthermore, the model predicts a symmetric pseudogap metal-dubbed `second Fermi liquid\"-in the underdoped regime, yielding a phase diagram analogous to that of hole-doped cuprates. The bilayer Kondo model therefore, presents a promising platform for both realizing higher-Tc superconductors and exploring non-Fermi liquid physics. We also comment on the possible limitations of the current models for the bilayer nickelate material and point out some future directions."

      "summary": "Demonstrating superconductivity in purely repulsive Hubbard models is a compelling goal which underscores the counter-intuitive ability of Coulomb interactions to mediate superconductivity. Here, we present numerical evidence for robust superconductivity in a triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model at $\\pi/2$ flux per plaquette. Employing infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations on infinite cylinders of finite circumference, we observe superconducting ground states for a wide range of dopings, whose pair-correlations strengthen as the 2D limit is approached. At a density of one electron per site, Hubbard interactions have been reported to drive the insulating parent state of the superconductor from an integer quantum Hall (IQH) state to a chiral spin liquid (CSL). Our findings give credence to a recent proposal that proximity to the IQH-CSL transition serves to make chiral superconductivity energetically favorable on doping, and also correctly predicts the nature of the edge modes in the superconductor. On the CSL side, this suggests the superconductor can be thought of as arising from Laughlin's `anyon superconductivity' mechanism. Thus the Hubbard-Hofstadter model studied here offers a clean and experimentally accessible setup, potentially realizable in moir\\'e heterostructures, for exploring the properties of anyonic matter at finite density and the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality and superconductivity."

Our framework offers a complete and material specific description of the excitonic properties of phosphorene, including exciton states and exciton-phonon interactions, which allow us to quantitatively evaluate the optical absorption spectra, exciton relaxation, and exciton transport, revealing direction-dependent characteristics. Interestingly, we identify the critical role of long-range exchange interactions, which significantly enhance the anisotropy of exciton diffusion, particularly at low temperatures. Our work provides fundamental insights into exciton dynamics in an intrinsically anisotropic 2D material, offering guiding principles for the design of next-generation optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "Pair density waves and exotic superconductivity have long been of strong interest, and have attracted much recent attention. We present a joint theoretical and experimental exploration of possible signatures of fermion pairing with finite center-of-mass momentum, or the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) order. Experimentally a doped and spin-imbalanced attractive two-dimensional Hubbard model is realized with a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice, and quantum gas microscopy is used to probe its properties. Computationally we study the same model with state-of-the-art constrained-path (CP) auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Direct comparisons between experiment and computation on various short-range magnetic and charge correlations show excellent agreement. We then investigate these correlations, as well as pairing correlation functions, systematically to low temperatures with CP-AFQMC, and determine parameter regimes in density and magnetization where signatures of FFLO order may be observed. We show that the temperature at which precursors of such orders appear is already within reach of the current experiment. We discuss routes for direct experimental detection and measurements of such states."

      "summary": "Emergent symmetries and slow crossover phenomena are central themes in quantum criticality and manifest themselves in the pseudocritical scaling experienced in the context of deconfined criticality. Here we discover its conceptual counterpart, i.e., a symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition. It emerges from a one-dimensional realization of deconfined criticality between charge- and bond-ordered states driven by competing Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon couplings, for which quantum fluctuations and thereby the nature of the transition can be tuned systematically via the phonon frequency $\\omega_0$. In the classical limit $\\omega_0 \\to 0$, a low-energy Dirac theory predicts a direct first-order transition with emergent U(1) symmetry. Using exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide strong evidence for symmetry enhancement and even finite-size scaling on intermediate length scales but in the thermodynamic limit it turns into a narrow intermediate phase where both order parameters are finite, as chiral U(1) symmetry is weakly broken on the lattice. Including quantum lattice fluctuations diminishes the width of the intermediate phase, gradually restores the U(1) symmetry, and eventually tunes the system to a deconfined quantum critical point."

      "summary": "We investigate quantum transport in aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers fabricated via solution spinning, focusing on the roles of structural dimensionality and quantum interference effects. The fibers exhibit metallic behavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as the temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below this temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling, signaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with localization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low temperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the effective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL models in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can reproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our fiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the experimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework that quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using realistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter. Although this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude correction, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure of CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a 3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent transport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing conductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications."

These results not only represent the largest values known to date among full-Heusler materials but confirm earlier theoretical predictions that $p$-type Ru$_2$TiSi systems would be superior to their $n$-type counterparts. Moreover, using a two-band model, we unveil electronic structure changes induced by the Hf substitution at the Ti site and outline strategies to further improve $zT$ up to $zT > 1$.

Hardness is evaluated via nanoindentation simulations. The study confirms that gravitational forces significantly affect the solidification pathways of Al Cu alloys.

Moreover, hardness exhibits a coupled dependence on both composition and gravity, offering a promising avenue for bottom-up design of components tailored for extraterrestrial environments.

Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we compare how the occupancies of bonding and antibonding levels, as well as the associated electronic forces in a diatomic molecule, are affected when the molecule is coupled to either a metallic (graphene) or a topological (Kane-Mele) substrate. We find a greater dissociative capability in the topological substrate than in graphene, a difference mainly attributed to the localized nature of the edge states. The inclusion of vacancy disorder within the substrate further enhances this disparity in the dissociative force. Our findings highlight the role of topological protection in molecular dissociation under non-equilibrium conditions, pointing to new opportunities for robust catalysis in topological materials."

      "summary": "Transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers unite two frontiers of quantum materials research: sliding ferroelectricity, arising from rhombohedral (R) stacking, and moir\\'e quantum matter, emerging from small-angle twisting. The spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric R-stacked homobilayers produces a highly tunable band structure, which, together with strain-induced piezoelectricity, governs the topology and correlated electronic phases of twisted bilayers. Here we present a systematic low-temperature optical spectroscopy study of R-stacked bilayer WSe$_2$ to quantitatively establish its fundamental electronic and ferroelectric properties. Exciton and exciton-polaron spectroscopy under doping reveals a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry that confirms type-II band alignment, with the conduction and valence band edges located at the $\\Lambda$ and K valleys, respectively. Through distinct excitonic responses and tunable interlayer-intralayer exciton hybridization under displacement fields, we uncover the coexistence of AB and BA ferroelectric domains. Using exciton-polarons as a probe, we directly measure the intrinsic polarization field and extract the interlayer potential. Finally, we demonstrate electric-field-driven symmetric switching of the valence band maximum, attributed to ferroelectric domain switching. These results provide a complete experimental picture of the band alignment, spontaneous polarization field, and domain dynamics of R-stacked WSe$_2$, establishing key parameters to understand twisted bilayers and enabling new ferroelectric and excitonic device opportunities."

Mn3Si2Te6 has emerged as a prototypical CMR material, notable for its puzzling magnetoresistance behavior and pronounced directional anisotropy. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms driving CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 remain elusive [1-4]. In this work, we explore the magnetic resonance of Mn3Si2Te6 and observe a reduced g-factor for magnetic fields applied along the crystalline c-axis compared to the ab-plane, indicating a substantial orbital magnetization contribution along the c-axis. Furthermore, we detect resistance modulation under resonance conditions, suggesting that CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 is sensitive to the out-of-the plane spin polarization. These findings shed new light on the role of orbital magnetic moment in Mn3Si2Te6, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom of electrons in this system."

Because of its thermally-driven insulator-to-metal phase transition behavior, the VO2 metafilms work as spectrally-selective solar absorber with a high solar absorptance of 0.86 and a low infrared emissivity of ~0.2 at daytime, while they behave as selective cooler at nighttime to dissipate heat effectively through the atmospheric transparency window with a high emissivity of ~0.76 to cold outer space. From the outdoor vacuum tests, a significant temperature rise up to 169 K upon solar heating and a temperature drop of 17 K at night are experimentally observed from these tunable VO2 metafilms. With the atmosphere temperature fitted in-situ, the accurate heat transfer model shows excellent agreement with the stagnation temperature measurement, and indicates a high heating power of ~400 W/m2 at 80{\\deg}C sample temperature in the middle of the day, and a cooling power of ~60 W/m2 at 30{\\deg}C in equilibrium with ambient at night. This work would facilitate the development of self-adaptive coatings with cost-effective and scalable fabrication approaches for all-day energy harvesting."

For the case of $V_7=V_8$ with the local $\\Gamma_5$ triplet ground state, we have reported the discovery of a three-channel Kondo (TCK) phase, characterized by a residual entropy of $\\log \\phi$ with the golden ratio $\\phi=(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$. In this research, by depicting the ground-state phase diagram on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane, we attempt to unveil the effect of $V_7$ and $V_8$ on the emergence of the TCK phase. After performing a lot of numerical calculations, we find that the TCK phase appears in a relatively wide region on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane. The boundary curves surrounding the TCK phase are determined by the variation of the temperature dependence in entropy and the abrupt change in energy spectra. We consider that most of the phases surrounding the TCK phase are Fermi liquids, but the non-Fermi liquid two-channel Kondo phase is unexpectedly found to exist next to the TCK phase. Finally, we briefly comment on the actual material concerning the detection of the TCK phase."

Hirshfeld charge analysis reveals significant charge transfer from Ag to Mo in small clusters, which decreases with size as the system transitions toward delocalized metallic bonding. These findings provide detailed insights into the size-dependent interplay of geometry, bonding, and electronic structure in Ag$_n$Mo clusters, with implications for their catalytic and material applications."

While amorphous materials such as SiN have been widely used in high-$Q$ mechanical resonators utilizing stress-induced dissipation dilution, crystalline materials have emerging potential to achieve higher quality factors by combining low intrinsic loss and high tensile stress. In this paper, we demonstrate high-Q membrane resonators using ultra-high-stress crystalline TiN. Our membrane resonator exhibits a tensile stress exceeding 2.3 GPa and a quality factor of $Q = 8.0 \\times 10^6$ at 2.2 K. By estimating the dilution factor, we infer that our TiN resonator has a intrinsic quality factor comparable to that of SiN membrane resonators. With its ultra-high stress and crystalline properties, our TiN films can serve as a powerful tool for opto- and electromechanical systems, offering highly dissipation-diluted mechanical resonators."

Knight shift analysis yields distinct hyperfine coupling constants, revealing that they arise predominantly from RKKY-type transferred hyperfine fields through conduction electrons. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal pronounced anisotropic spin fluctuations, and comparison of the relaxation rates between the two Al sites clarifies the momentum-space structure of these fluctuations. At low magnetic fields, $(T_1T)^{-1}$ is strongly enhanced on cooling toward the N\\'eel temperature, indicating the growth of in-plane antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state."

It is confirmed that the trapping effect gives rise to Type-I aging where the relaxation time increases with waiting time regardless of the direction of temperature change, and that the delayed response of the FEL produces Type-II aging where the waiting-time dependence of the relaxation time depends on the direction of temperature change. When both effects exist and the response time of the FEL is appropriate, these effects can be differentiated in the short-time behavior of the temporal relaxation time. It is argued that the material time or the internal clock and the fictive temperature introduced phenomenologically are understood as the concepts describing the delayed response of the FEL to temperature change."

      "summary": "Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferromagnets are canonical devices in spintronics, with wide-ranging applications in data storage, computing, and sensing. They simultaneously exhibit mechanisms for electrical detection of magnetic order through the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, and reciprocally, for controlling magnetic order by electric currents through spin-transfer torque (STT). It was long assumed that neither of these effects could be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials, since they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral antiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment, which are manifestations of their spin-split band structure. However, the reciprocal effect, i.e., the antiferromagnetic counterpart of STT driven by currents through the AFMTJ, has been assumed non-existent due to the total electric current being spin-neutral. Here, in contrast to this common expectation, we report nanoscale AFMTJs exhibiting this reciprocal effect, which we term octupole-driven spin-transfer torque (OTT). We demonstrate current-induced OTT switching of PtMn3|MgO|PtMn3 AFMTJs, fabricated on a thermally oxidized silicon substrate, exhibiting a record-high TMR value of 363% at room temperature and switching current densities of the order of 10 MA/cm2. Our theoretical modeling explains the origin of OTT in terms of the imbalance between intra- and inter-sublattice spin currents across the AFMTJ, and equivalently, in terms of the non-zero net cluster octupole polarization of each PtMn3 layer. This work establishes a new materials platform for antiferromagnetic spintronics and provides a pathway towards deeply scaled magnetic memory and room-temperature terahertz technologies."

We explore a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian superconductor with balanced gain and loss. To ensure experimental relevance, we develop a right-eigenstate-based non-Hermitian mean-field theory. We uncover a novel first-order phase transition that coincides exactly with the PT symmetry breaking point, driven by the interplay between superconducting pairing interactions and non-Hermitian dissipation. In the PT-symmetric phase, moderate NH dissipation enhances superconductivity, while in the PT-broken phase, intensified dissipation significantly suppresses it. These phenomena, characterized by abrupt jumps in observables, can be probed through localized spectral measurements and macroscopic superfluid density analysis. Additionally, the stability analysis offers robust theoretical insights to support experimental investigations of this unique transition."

By systematically analyzing the ground-state fidelity, low-lying energy spectra, exciton superfluid and stripe order parameters, and ground-state energy derivatives, we identify a direct and continuous quantum phase transition between two distinct symmetry-breaking phases by tuning the layer separation: an exciton superfluid phase with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking at small separation, and a unidirectional charge density wave with broken translational symmetry at large separation. Our results highlight quantum Hall bilayers as an ideal platform for realizing and experimentally probing DQCPs under precisely tunable interactions."

Their electronic structures closely resemble those of La3Ni2O7, especially in the hole-type band dominated by Ni-3dz2 orbital character.

      "summary": "While the spin ice state of bulk pyrochlores such as $\\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ and $\\rm{Ho_2Ti_2O_7}$ has been extensively studied in the last several decades due to its unique degenerate ground state and emergent monopole excitation, whether it survives in the thin-film form remains a mystery. The limited volume of thin-film sample makes it challenging to study the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, we synthesized 18nm-thick $\\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film on YSZ substrate and capped it by a thin conductive $\\rm{Bi_2Ir_2O_7}$ layer, and performed the proximitized magnetoresistance measurements. Our study found that the ice-rule-breaking phase transition survives but with a modified effective nearest-neighbor interaction and distorted Ising spin axes compared to the bulk crystal. The results are supported by the simultaneously measured capacitive torque magnetometry. Our study demonstrates that proximitized transport is an effective tool for thin films of insulating frustrated magnets."

      "summary": "Silica fume is a valuable by-product from the silicon and ferrosilicon production. It is therefore important to understand the impact on the silica fume quality when converting the furnace feed from fossil-based to renewable reduction materials. Using self-consistent numerical simulations of the nucleation and condensation process, we present a detailed study of the silica fume formation process. It is found that the most critical physical effect that determines the final particle size distribution is coalescence due to Brownian motion. Furthermore, it is crucial to use appropriate thermophysical parameters in order to reproduce reliable particle size distributions. Contrary to what has been done in previous studies on the same topic, this is now done by using reasonable expressions for surface energy, saturation pressure and the nucleation pre-exponential factor. It is also found that under conditions relevant to furnaces, the liberation of latent heat leads to an explosive chain reaction of particle nucleation and condensation when the first particles nucleate and start growing due to condensation. This process continues until the relative saturation pressure of silicon dioxide is reduced to unity. Finally, it is found that the Lagrangian approach for particle tracking is more flexible and accurate, and also more CPU efficient, than the Eulerian approach."

      "summary": "In 1995, the Nobel Price winner P.W. Anderson made the following remarkable statement: The deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory is probably the theory of the nature of glass and glass transition. Although there have been new theoretical developments in the meantime, in our opinion, this situation has only improved marginally to date. One of the main reasons is the insufficient consideration of experimental boundary conditions. A central experimental problem arises from the fact that the time constants required to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium increase sharply in the vicinity of and above a hypothetical static glass transition. If these equilibrium conditions are violated, additional internal thermodynamic variables come into play that normally alter the static and dynamic susceptibilities significantly and thus lead to misinterpretations of the experimental data. This raises, for example, the question of whether there are static property changes during the canonical glass transition and how these correlate with dynamic precursors. In this article, we attempt to find answers to these questions using a new experimental method called temperature-modulated optical refractometry in combination with the temperature-jump technique. The total time required to investigate the glass transition behaviour of our model epoxy was approximately two years."

These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials."

For magnetic systems the crystal structure, material composition, size, and shape determine already most of the magnetism-related properties. Here, we investigate the reciprocal route, which is controlling nanostructure growth via magnetism. To this end we deposit Co on a uniaxial antiferromagnetic surface above and below its N\\'eel temperature. Growth above the N\\'eel temperature results in the formation of roughly hexagonal islands, reflecting the surface symmetry. For growth below the N\\'eel temperature we find quasi-one-dimensional Co nanostructures along distinct crystallographic directions, which signal the local antiferromagnetic domain orientation. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of controlling growth via magnetism and the necessity to take magnetism-related effects into account for growth on magnetic surfaces."

However, due to the knowledge lacking on the origin and underlying mechanism of ferroelectric APV effect, substantial challenges still remain in exploring new APV-active candidate materials. The emerging shift current model, involving the transfer of photogenerated charges through the displacement of wave functions, has attracted considerable attention for its unique insights into the bulk photovoltaic effect. Here, we present strong APV properties in a high-temperature double perovskite ferroelectric (cyclohexylmethylammonium)$_2$CsAgBiBr$_7$, showing an extremely large above-bandgap photovoltage up to about 40 V. This figure-of-merit is far beyond its bandgap of about 2.3 eV and comparable to the state-of-art molecular ferroelectrics. Strikingly, the shift current model reveals an intrinsic correlation with Cs$^{+}$ cation displacement and provides, for the first time, an explicit explanation for the structural origin of ferroelectric APV activities. Besides, its steady-state APV photocurrent exhibits the unique light-polarization dependence, which endows remarkable polarization-sensitivity with the highest polarization ratios of about 41 among the known 2D single-phase materials. As the unprecedented exploration of ferroelectric APV characteristics illuminated by the shift current mechanism, this finding paves a pathway to assemble new optoelectronic smart devices."

Being metallic, such altermagnets may undergo a further instability at low temperatures to a superconducting state, and it is an interesting open question what are the salient features of such altermagnetic superconductors? We address this question on the basis of realistic microscopic models that capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom. We find that the sublattice structure can strongly affect the superconducting gap structure in altermagnetic superconductors. In particular, it imposes nodes in the gap on the Brillouin zone edges for superconductors stabilized by momentum-independent bare attraction channels. We contrast this to the case of nearest-neighbor pairing where pairing is allowed on the Brillouin zone edges and $d$-wave gap structures can be favored."

SAW absorption from the interaction with magnons in Ni displays a strong anisotropic dependence on the direction of the applied in-plane magnetic field. Magnetic anisotropy is further investigated by magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements to show both uniaxial and biaxial anisotropy components in Ni films on LiNbO3. By introducing a dipolar interaction term in addition to the anisotropies, we successfully explain the anisotropic SAW absorption in our devices. These findings show the importance of substrate-induced anisotropy and long-range dipolar effects in SAW-magnons hybrid devices and indicate future directions for optimizing these spin-acoustic devices through comprehensive anisotropy engineering."

      "summary": "Chromonic liquid crystals (CLCs) are lyotropic materials which are attracting growing interest for their adaptability to living systems. A considerable body of works has been devoted to exploring their properties and applications. In this paper, I endeavour to review some of the contributions concerning their theoretical modelling, aimed at rationalizing experimental observations. The elastic theory of CLCs is not completely established. Their ground state in the 3D space, as revealed by a number of recent experiments, is quite different from that of ordinary nematic liquid crystals: it is twisted instead of uniform. The common explanation provided for this state within the classical Oseen-Frank elastic theory demands that one Ericksen's inequality is violated. Since such a violation would make the Oseen-Frank stored energy density unbounded below, the legitimacy of these theoretical treatments is threatened by a number of mathematical issues. To overcome these difficulties, a novel elastic theory has been proposed and tested for CLCs; it extends the classical Oseen-Frank energy by incorporating a quartic twist term. Another key characteristic of CLCs is that they exhibit broad biphasic regions, in which the nematic and isotropic phases coexist. Mathematical models inspired by experimental settings have been developed for CLC droplets in 2D. The contributions reviewed here address the morphogenesis of nuclei and topological defects during phase transitions, the topological shape transformations arising from the interplay of nematic elastic constants, and the prediction of shape bistability (yet to be observed) where tactoids and smooth-edged discoids can coexist in equilibrium. General methods have also been applied to experimental data to extract estimates of the isotropic surface tension at the nematic isotropic interface and the chromonics' planar anchoring strength."

The SW in our simulation are driven by a sustained impact originating in the bumpy floor of the channel. We show that, when generated in this manner, forces in the driven SW wavefront within the 3D assembly follow the same power law scaling on material properties and impact velocity as in a 1D chain. A simple scaling of the 1D forces matches results from simulated impact tests we conduct using Soft Sphere Discrete Element method simulations. We then quantify the magnitude of Solitary Wave Induced Surface Dilation (SID) that occurs as a result of varied material properties and gravitational environments, giving an equation that can be used to predict the lofting depth (depth to which particles experience bulk density changes as a result of a laterally propagating SW wavefront). As predicted by our equation and confirmed with simulated results, SID is amplified as particle material properties become closer to lunar regolith grains, supporting the hypothesis that SID is the Lunar Cold Spot formation mechanism."

      "summary": "Unconventional superconductors exhibit multiple broken symmetries and exceed the range of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. For instance, time-reversal symmetry can be broken in addition to the gauge symmetry, resulting in superconductors that can be enhanced or induced by a magnetic field. However, such unconventional superconductivities are more vulnerable to impurities than their BCS counterparts, requiring highly ordered and clean material systems to observe them. Crystalline rhombohedral multilayer graphene is a promising platform to explore unconventional superconductivity due to its superior material quality and gate-tunable strong correlation effects. Here we report transport measurements of rhombohedral tetralayer and pentalayer graphene, where a spectrum of superconductivities in a clean limit are observed. Three of them (SC2-4) show highly unusual enhancements by magnetic fields: 1. SC2 is strengthened by an in-plane field; 2. SC3 is boosted by a small out-of-plane field; 3. SC4 is induced by an in-plane field. All these superconductors are robust against an in-plane field up to 8.5 Tesla, exceeding the Pauli limit of conventional superconductors by tens of times and suggesting their unconventional nature. Moreover, we observed that proximitized spin-orbit coupling generates a plethora of new superconductors in the phase diagram, while maintaining the high quality of bare rhombohedral graphene. Our work establishes a family of new superconductors in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which also provides an ideal platform to engineer non-Abelian quasiparticles by proximitizing with quantum anomalous Hall states existing in the same material system."

Both phases show an unexpected robustness against timing noise. The noise-induced decay of initially populated topological edge modes occurs in two stages: At short times, thermalization among edge modes leads to exponential decay. This is followed by slow algebraic decay $\\sim n^{-1/2}$ with the number of Floquet cycles $n$. The exponent of $1/2$ is characteristic for one-dimensional diffusion, here occurring along the direction perpendicular to the edge. In contrast, localized modes in the bulk exhibit faster decay, $\\sim n^{-1}$, corresponding to two-dimensional diffusion. We demonstrate these behaviors through full-scale numerical simulations and support our conclusions using analytical results based upon a phenomenological model. Our findings indicate that two-dimensional Floquet topological phases are ideal candidates for potential applications of Floquet topology, given the unavoidable presence of both quenched disorder and decoherence in experiments."

However, the electronic origin of such extreme stoichiometry sensitivities remains unclear. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify and characterize a dramatic eV-scale electronic restructuring that occurs across the $x_c$. Moment-carrying Fe 3$d_{z^2}$ electrons manifest as narrow bands within 200 meV to the Fermi level, distinct from other transition metal intercalated TMD magnets. This state strongly interacts with the itinerant electron in TMD layer, and rapidly loses coherence above $x_c$. These observations resemble the exceptional electronic and magnetic sensitivity of strongly correlated systems upon charge doping, shedding light on the important role of electronic correlation in magnetic TMDs."

      "summary": "Effective interactions inherently encompass many-body effects that appear unified. Analyzing these in reverse, that is, separating them into contributions from pairs, triples, or larger groups, is typically intricate and seldom pursued. However, this could offer essential insights into the structural architecture of complex systems, such as soft materials. This contribution tackles this issue employing a new simulation-based approach to accurately determine effective interactions. The approach is sufficiently sensitive to assess the effects of higher-order terms in the depletion potentials between large particles. Previous research has primarily focused on the role of small particles, and this work expands on these findings. However, understanding the contributions of large particles on the effective forces, particularly beyond the dilute limit, remains challenging and is not yet fully grasped, leading us to primarily focus on exploring this topic. Within the range of particle concentrations examined here, while maintaining a constant chemical potential for smaller particles, we have observed that the concentration of larger particles has no impact on the entropic potential between large colloids, as long as the size ratio remains below $q=0.15$. This confirms a long-established prediction founded on purely geometric considerations, which we have confirmed by means of direct observation. In contrast, for mixtures with less size asymmetry, such effects become considerably influential. Specifically, we have conducted an in-depth examination of scenarios with size asymmetries of $q=0.45$ and $0.60$. Our results for the depletion forces were directly compared with those obtained from the integral equation theory, which has also enabled us to improve and refine the approaches involved."

For finite Rabi coupling, the system exhibits zero-momentum, elongated zero-momentum, and stripe phases, while in the limit $\\Omega\\rightarrow 0$, the superstripe wave phases emerge. Varying the attractive density-density ($c_0$) and spin-exchange ($c_2$) interactions induces the transition from stripe and superstripe phases to the elongated zero-momentum phase, characterized by miscibility and polarization. The condensate remains miscible in the zero-momentum phase and partially miscible for the elongated, stripe, and superstripe phases. Quenching in Rabi coupling stabilizes the condensate, while spin-orbit coupling quenching leads to fluctuations or the formation of complex patterns, with the stripe phase exhibiting the vanishing of the zeroth spin component over time. Our results may offer valuable insights into engineering exotic quantum phases in ultracold atomic gases."

Adiabatically switching on the tunnel couplings to the reservoirs generates a thermal current that dynamically builds up and reaches a quasi-steady-state regime. In this time window, the two-terminal thermal conductance can approach half-quantized values -- a hallmark of Majorana-mediated transport -- under finely tuned conditions. The results agree with a steady-state Landauer-B\\\"uttiker description for sufficiently large reservoirs, where energy-resolved transmission rates help identify the optimal parameters to achieve the half-quantized conductance. This work provides a controllable platform to investigate topological thermal transport in engineered spin systems, such as realized in cold-atom and Rydberg-atom settings."

      "summary": "Interfacial thermal transport is a critical bottleneck in nanoscale systems, where heat dissipation and energy efficiency are strongly modulated by molecular ordering at solid-liquid boundaries. Here, using atomistic simulations of hexadecane confined by structured silica substrates, we reveal how interfacial geometry, specifically curvature, governs the density distribution and thermal transport across the interface. At flat and mildly curved surfaces, the liquid exhibits surface-templated layering, promoting efficient heat transfer, which is enhanced with increasing contact surface area. As curvature increases, this ordering breaks down, giving rise to interference-like density patterns, reduced molecular packing, and localized depletion zones. This structural reorganization leads to a systematic increase in interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), even when the contact area is kept constant. By decomposing the interface into convex (\"hill\" of solid) and concave (\"valley\" of solid) regions, we find that valleys consistently offer lower thermal resistance. In contrast, hills act as bottlenecks to heat flow. Remarkably, we show that the work of adhesion and entropy-related energy losses scale non-trivially with curvature: while adhesion increases with contact area, the entropic penalty dominates the total energy change, reflecting curvature-induced frustration of molecular alignment. These findings unveil a direct link between surface geometry, thermodynamic dissipation, and heat transport, offering new design principles for thermally tunable nanostructured materials, thermal interface coatings, and phase-change systems."

      "summary": "Accurate identification of nonlinear material parameters from three-dimensional full-field deformation data remains a challenge in experimental mechanics. The virtual fields method (VFM) provides a powerful, computationally efficient approach for material model calibration, however, its success depends critically on the choice of virtual fields and the informativeness of available kinematic data. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art discrete formulation of the sensitivity-based virtual fields (SBVF) method by systematically developing and comparing alternative variational and analytical SBVFs within a strain-invariant-based modeling framework. A central contribution of this work is the implementation and assessment of variation-based SBVFs (vSBVFs), formulated using directional G\\^ateaux derivatives, as well as virtual fields derived from analytical differentiation (aSBVFs) which provide explicit, model-tailored virtual displacement fields for parameter identification. Using simulated noisy volumetric datasets, we demonstrate that vSBVFs and aSBVFs enable procedural, automated construction of optimal virtual fields for each material parameter, substantially enhancing the robustness and efficiency of calibration without the need for manual field selection or high temporal resolution in the data acquisition. We quantify data richness -- the effective diversity of sampled kinematic states -- showing that increased data richness via sample geometry and loading protocols leads to improved parameter identifiability. These findings establish a pathway for automated, noise-robust material model calibration suitable for future deployment with experimental full-field imaging of soft, complex materials, and provide a foundation for optimizing shape topology and extending to viscoelastic and anisotropic behaviors."

Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter."

While their capability for modeling phonon properties is emerging, systematic benchmarking across chemically diverse systems remains limited. We evaluate six recent uMLPs (EquiformerV2, MatterSim, MACE, and CHGNet) on 2,429 crystalline materials from the Open Quantum Materials Database. Models were used to compute atomic forces in displaced supercells, derive interatomic force constants (IFCs), and predict phonon properties including lattice thermal conductivity (LTC), compared with density functional theory (DFT) and experimental data. The EquiformerV2 pretrained model trained on the OMat24 dataset exhibits strong performance in predicting atomic forces and third-order IFC, while its fine-tuned counterpart consistently outperforms other models in predicting second-order IFC, LTC, and other phonon properties. Although MACE and CHGNet demonstrated comparable force prediction accuracy to EquiformerV2, notable discrepancies in IFC fitting led to poor LTC predictions. Conversely, MatterSim, despite lower force accuracy, achieved intermediate IFC predictions, suggesting error cancellation and complex relationships between force accuracy and phonon predictions. This benchmark guides the evaluation and selection of uMLPs for high-throughput screening of materials with targeted thermal transport properties."

By utilizing population annealing Monte Carlo simulations together with a rejection-free and adaptive update, we can equilibrate systems with $J_2$ as low as $-0.23 J_1$. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis we show that the system undergoes a second-order phase transition within the Ising universality class at least down to $J_2 =-0.23 J_1$ and, most likely, for all $J_2 > - J_1 / 4$. As we show here, there exist very long-lived metastable states in this system explaining the first-order like behavior seen in only partially equilibrated systems."

Powered by the transduction of stored energy resources, these behaviors enable biological systems to regulate functions, achieve specific outcomes, and maintain stability far from thermodynamic equilibrium. These behaviors span orders of magnitude in length and time: from nanometer-scale molecular motors driving morphogenesis to kilometer-scale seasonal migrations, and from millisecond reflexes to millennia of evolutionary adaptations. While physical laws govern the dynamics of biological systems, they alone are insufficient to fully explain how living systems sense, decide, adapt, and, ultimately, control their dynamics. In this article, we argue that control theory provides a powerful, unifying framework for understanding how biological systems regulate dynamics to maintain stability across length and time scales far from equilibrium."

Here, we perform a full mean-field analysis of the system, including all relevant atomic momentum states and the cavity field. We map out the steady-state phase diagram vs pump strength and cavity detuning, and provide an in-depth understanding of the instabilities that are linked to the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns. We find and describe parameter regimes where mean-field predicts bistability, regimes where the dynamics form chaotic trajectories, instabilities caused by resonances between normal mode excitations, and states with atomic dynamics but vanishing cavity field."

Here we present an exact analytical framework, supported by simulations, to characterize the steady states of two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles and three-dimensional torque-driven counterparts in a harmonic trap. Using a Laplace-transform approach of the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive closed-form expressions for displacement moments and excess kurtosis, providing a precise probe of non-Gaussian statistics. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: bimodal active states with off-center peaks, Gaussian-like passive states, and weakly heavy-tailed distributions unique to two dimensions. We show that dimensionality plays a decisive role: in two dimensions, increasing chirality suppresses activity and restores passive behavior, while in three dimensions torque preserves activity along the torque axis, producing anisotropic steady states. These behaviors are captured by simple active length-scale arguments that map the boundaries between passive and active phases. Our results offer concrete experimental signatures - including kurtosis crossovers, off-center peaks, and torque-induced anisotropy - that establish confinement as a powerful tool to probe and control chiral and torque-driven active matter."

According to the Arrhenius Law, the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height, reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total barrier height $\\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental validation using optical trapping techniques."

In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev.

In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and checked experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\\\"averstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process."

Recently discovered quasi-one-dimensional topological material, Bi$_4$I$_4$, has been predicted to host topologically non-trivial gapless surfaces at high temperature, which undergo a finite temperature phase transition to a low temperature gapped phase. Here we present experimental signatures of this room temperature phase transition from a high-temperature $\\beta$-phase with a surface state to a gapped $\\alpha$-phase hosting hinge states. Using real-space current mapping and resistance fluctuation spectroscopy, we identify signatures of a displacive topological phase transition mediated by a first-order thermodynamic structural change. Near the emergence of $\\beta$-phase, we observe pronounced telegraphic noise, indicating fluctuating phase domains with topological surface states. The spatially resolved current map reveals electron transport via the gapless surface states in the $\\beta$-phase, which vanishes upon transitioning to the $\\alpha$-phase with localized conduction channels (or hinge modes). Our experimental results, supported by first principles estimates and effective theory of a topological displacive phase transition, establish Bi$_4$I$_4$ as a candidate material showing intricate interplay of classical thermodynamic phase transitions with topological quantum phenomena."

      "summary": "Motivated by recent experimental observations of possible spin supersolid states in triangular lattice compounds, we study the dynamical properties of various ground states in the spin-1/2 easy-axis antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with impurities under magnetic fields, using numerical Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods. For both spin supersolid states in the low and high fields, the gapless Goldstone mode at the $K$ points remains robust with impurities, which is related to the presence of spin superfluidity. As a comparison, we find a splitting of magnon band at the same impurity density level in the conventional magnetic state, the so-called up-up-down state. In addition, the finite superfluid stiffness probed by the twisted phase in the spin supersolid states is consistent with the excitation spectrum. We argue that this excitation spectrum with impurity provides direct evidence of the dissipationless dynamics in the spin supersolid states, which could be tested in neutron scattering experiments."

      "summary": "Van der Waals stacking presents new opportunities for nonlinear optics with its remarkable tunability and scalability. However, the fundamental role of interlayer interactions in modifying the overall nonlinear optical susceptibilities remains elusive. In this letter, we report an anisotropic enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) from a WS$_2$/ReSe$_2$ heterobilayer, where the individual composite layers possess distinctive crystal phases. We investigate polarization-resolved response and twist-angle dependence in SHG and reveal that band alignment alone is insufficient to explain the observed anisotropy in the modified SHG response. Spectral shifts in excitonic features highlight band renormalization, supporting the role of hybridization between the two layers. Furthermore, SHG enhancement is highly anisotropic and can even be suppressed in some orientations, suggesting possible intensity-borrowing mechanisms within the heterostructure. Our work demonstrates the ability to tune both the intensity and polarization dependence of nonlinear optical responses with van der Waals stacking of distinctive crystal phases."

      "summary": "Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have emerged as a crucial platform for exploring the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. However, the Fermi surface topology required for superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we report the thin film growth and ambient-pressure superconductivity of both hybrid monolayer-bilayer (1212) and pure bilayer (2222) structures, together with the absence of superconductivity in hybrid monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, under identical compressive epitaxial strain. The onset superconducting transition temperature is up to 50 K, exceeding the McMillan limit, in the 1212 structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals key Fermi surface differences in these atomically-engineered structures. In superconducting 1212 and 2222 films, a dispersive hole-like band (i.e. the {\\gamma} band) crosses the Fermi level, surrounding the Brillouin zone corner. In contrast, the top of the {\\gamma} flat band is observed ~70 meV below the Fermi level in the non-superconducting 1313 films. Our findings expand the family of ambient-pressure nickelate superconductors and establish a connection between structural configuration, electronic structure, and the emergence of superconductivity in nickelates."

      "summary": "Rydberg atoms trapped by optical tweezers have emerged as a versatile platform to emulate lattices with different geometries, in which long-range interacting spins lead to fascinating phenomena, ranging from spin liquids to topological states of matter. Here, we show that when the lattice has a fractal geometry with Hausdorff dimension 1.58, additional surprises appear. The system is described by a transverse-field Ising model with long-range van der Waals interactions in a Sierpi\\`nski gasket fractal. We investigate the problem theoretically using exact diagonalization, variational mean field, quantum Monte Carlo, and a graph-based numerical technique, SIM-GRAPH, which we developed. We find that in the quantum regime, the phase diagram exhibits phases in which the spins flip one-by-one. The theoretical results are in excellent agreement with experiments performed with single 88Sr atoms trapped by optical tweezers arranged in a fractal geometry. The magnetization and von Neumann entanglement entropy reveal several regimes in which single spin-flips are delocalized over many sites of one sublattice, thus allowing for an unprecedented control of a cascade of phase transitions in a manybody system. These results expand the possibilities of Rydberg atoms for quantum information processing and may have profound implications in quantum technology."

      "summary": "Multicellular rosettes are observed in different situations such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression. While some molecular insights have been gained to explain the presence of these assemblies of five or more cells around a common center, what are the tunable, global features that favors/hinders their formation is still largely unknown. Here, we made use of a Voronoi dynamical model to investigate the ingredients driving the emergence of rosettes characterized by different degree of stability and organization. We found that (i) breaking the local spatial symmetry of the system, i.e., introducing curvature-inducing defects, allows for the formation of rosette-like structures (ii) whose probability of formation depends on the characteristic of the cellular layer. In particular, a trade-off between tissue fluidity and single cell deformability dictates the assembly of transient rosettes, that are strongly stabilized in the presence of cell alignment interactions. To test our model predictions, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on rosette-forming neural populations derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, finding significant agreement. Overall, our work may set the stage to gain an unifying understanding of the plethora of biophysical mechanisms involving the occurrence of rosette-like structure both in physiology and their altered formation in pathology."

      "summary": "The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a manifestation of broken centrosymmetry, has attracted interest as a probe of the symmetry and quantum geometry of materials, and for use in novel optoelectronic devices. Despite its bulk nature, the BPVE is typically measured with interfaces and metal contacts, raising concerns as to whether the observed signals are genuinely of bulk origin. Here, we use a contactless pump-probe microscopy method to observe the space- and time-resolved dynamics of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal, monodomain $BiFeO_{3}$. We observe asymmetric transport of carriers along the polar axis, confirming the intrinsic bulk and symmetry-driven nature of BPVE. This asymmetric transport persists for several nanoseconds after photoexcitation, which cannot be explained by the shift or phonon ballistic current BPVE mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations show that asymmetric momentum scattering by defects under non-equilibrium conditions explains the long-lived carrier drift, while first principles calculations confirm that oxygen vacancies have an asymmetric electronic state that can cause such asymmetric scattering. Our findings highlight the critical role of defects in long-lived photoresponses."

It is noted that the improvement of the interfacial interaction of the components of polymer reactoplastic composites, including adhesive strength, is a key factor for improving the reliability of the cured filled composite. As a promising area of research, a modification of the surface of the reinforcing fibrous filler and the technological characteristics of the liquid polymer binder, aimed at increasing their contact properties in the composite, was chosen. The effectiveness of the physical method of modifying the components of composites in the form of low-frequency ultrasonic processing is described. The peculiarities of cluster formation and physicochemical modification of epoxy polymers filled with dispersed fillers are analyzed. Attention is focused on the effectiveness of ultrasonic processing in the cavitation mode for deagglomeration and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid medium during the creation of nanocomposites. Experimentally confirmed is the improvement of the technological properties of liquid epoxy polymers, modified by ultrasound, used for the impregnation of oriented fibrous fillers, as well as the improvement of the physicomechanical properties of the sonicated epoxy matrices. Some issues of biological modifications of components of polymers for functional application are briefly reviewed."

Biodegradable electronics, which naturally dissolve after their functional lifetime, minimize the long-term burden on both patients and healthcare providers by eliminating the need for surgical retrieval. In this study, we developed a library of 3D-printable, biodegradable electronic inks encompassing conductors, semiconductors, dielectrics, thereby enabling the direct printing of fully functional, multi-material, customizable electronic systems in a single integrated process. Especially, conjugated molecules were introduced to improve charge mobility, energy level alignment in semiconducting inks. This ink platform supports the fabrication of passive/active components and physical/chemical sensors making it suitable for complex biomedical applications. Versatility of this system was demonstrated through two representative applications: (i) wireless pressure sensor embedded within biodegradable scaffolds, (ii) wireless electrical stimulators that retain programmable electrical functionality in vivo and degrade post-implantation. This work establishes a foundation of modules for autonomous, biodegradable bioelectronic systems fabricated entirely via 3D printing, with implications for personalized diagnostics, therapeutic interfaces, and transient medical devices."

We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of AI+MPS."

Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble."

However, there are multiple such groups of agents, and some of them have common choices. This overlap brings in additional competition among the agents making the variance reduction a complex optimization problem. We study multiple stochastic strategies and find that the most efficient strategy is the one where the agents have just the memory of their last visit to the their alternative choice. The resulting dynamics, even though giving the lowest population variance among the strategies studied here, end up in a frozen state. However, the frozen state does not bring the the variance to its lowest possible value; a situation qualitatively analogous to spin-glass systems."

While standard Ising anyons are limited to Clifford operations and thus not computationally universal, we show that their non-semisimple counterparts give rise to new anyon types we call \\emph{neglectons}; adding a single neglecton to the traditional Ising theory enables universal quantum computation through braiding alone. The resulting braid group representations are unitary with respect to an indefinite Hermitian form, with the computational subspace embedded in a positive-definite sector. We identify a range of parameters for which the model supports universal gate sets and, notably, special values of the parameter $\\alpha$ where the computational subspace decouples exactly from the negative-norm components of the Hilbert space. This leads to low-leakage, fully unitary evolution on the physical subspace and improved prospects for efficient gate compilation."

This representation is extended in this work to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of stochastic geometric representations are presented here in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions -- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications."

However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations."

To date such a quantum computing model has mainly been implemented with qubit-based superconducting hardware utilizing reset operations and classical logic.

Synchronizing the optical reset with a simple classical device storing history of measurement results allows one to decrease uncertainty of future measurements, which suggests unprecedented flexibility in constructing dynamical circuits on optical platforms.

Focusing on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous -- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum model to generate a given classical stochastic process."

We also calculate the topological number using the holographic Green's function and find that the Chern number is independent of the tilting parameter.

We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance."

      "summary": "Solutions of long, flexible polymer molecules are complex fluids that simultaneously exhibit fluid-like and solid-like behaviour. When subjected to external flows, dilute polymer solutions develop elastic turbulence - a unique chaotic flow state absent in Newtonian fluids such as water. Unlike turbulence in Newtonian fluids, elastic turbulence arises from polymer stretching and alignment in the flow, and can occur even at vanishing inertia. While experimental realisations of elastic turbulence are well documented, its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a perspective on the transition to elastic turbulence in pressure-driven channel flows, drawing on recent computational work from our group. We outline our current understanding of the transition in both two and three spatial dimensions, centred on two key building blocks: (i) narwhals, exact coherent states of the flow, and (ii) blessings, spatio-temporal intermittent states made up of several localised narwhal solutions. This contribution is based on a talk given by one of us (A.M.) at the 2024 APS DFD meeting."

      "summary": "Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \\mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends."

      "summary": "The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems."

In this Letter, we introduce such a representation for the family of Toric Code states by using Kitaev's Ladders as building blocks. We consider Toric Code states corresponding to various planar graphs and apply non-local dientanglers to qubits corresponding to non-contractible cycles that satisfy a topological constraint. We demonstrate that, independent of the geometry of the underlying graph, disentanglers convert Toric Code states into a tensor product of Kitaev's Ladder states. Since Kitaev's Ladders with arbitrary geometric configurations include the short-range entanglements, we conclude that the above universal and non-local pattern of entanglement between ladders is responsible of the long-range entanglement inherent in Toric Code states. Our result emphasizes in the capability of such non-local representations to describe topological order in ground-state wave functions of topological quantum systems."

      "summary": "The stationary spectrum of individual dipole emitters in plasmonic nanocavities has been studied for a range of cavity geometries and dipole configurations. Less is known about the coherent dynamics of single photon creation in the nanocavity near field by an excited dipole. We address this gap by developing a Lorentzian kernel approximation that solves the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation that describes the coupled dipole-photon dynamics in the single-excitation manifold. Our approach encodes the broadband nature of the nanocavity field through a non-Markovian memory kernel, derived from macroscopic QED theory. For a two-level dipole near a metallic nanosphere, we show that the single photon probability density in frequency space evolves in strong coupling from an initially localized source at the qubit frequency into a Rabi doublet over a timescale governed by the kernel spectrum. This dynamical crossover is accompanied by the formation of single-photon interference patterns in frequency and time, propagating coherently over a timescale limited by the shape of kernel spectrum to $\\sim 100-150$ fs, which is accessible to ultrafast spectroscopy. We also show that the stationary spectrum of the coupled system can be manipulated by driving the nanocavity field using coherent pulses with variable spectral bandwidth. Using single-photon pulses narrower than the kernel spectrum, the Rabi splitting in a system that supports strong coupling can be effectively removed. The applicability of our results to other dipole-nanocavity configurations is discussed and a general strong coupling criterion for nanocavities is formulated."

This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of a large amount of interactions. An unexpected and quantitative universal scaling of the expansion anisotropy is observed for the first time between cold atom and heavy-ion systems as a function of the number of collisions per particle or opacity ($n_{\\rm coll}$), despite their vast differences in scale and physics. The expansion isotropy in both the cold atom gases and heavy-ion collisions increases smoothly and shows no sign of saturation in the observed opacity range, with an approximate power-law dependence of $\\sqrt{n_{\\rm coll}}$, characteristic of random walks. This universality potentially unifies a variety of vastly different physical systems, from weakly interacting dilute gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe."

Here, we employ resonant soft x-ray scattering and polarimetry on thin films of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to determine that the magnetic structure of the SDW forms unidirectional diagonal spin stripes with moments lying within the NiO$_2$ plane and perpendicular to $\\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, but without evidence of the strong charge disproportionation typically associated with other nickelates. These stripes form anisotropic domains with shorter correlation lengths perpendicular versus parallel to $\\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, revealing nanoscale rotational and translational symmetry breaking analogous to the cuprate and Fe-based superconductors, with possible Bloch-like antiferromagnetic domain walls separating orthogonal domains."

We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\\mathbf E $ and $\\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence."

Inspired by the large lattice constants of moir\\'e materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology."

Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. We find that the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, and thus beyond the sharp increase in Hall carrier density to $\\simeq 1+x$ recently observed above $x^{*}\\simeq 0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1593 (2024)]. This suggests that doped iridates host a unique phase of matter in which a large Hall density coexists with an anisotropic pseudogap, breaking up the Fermi surface into disconnected arcs. The temperature boundary of the pseudogap is $T^{*}\\simeq 200$ K for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates and to the energy scale of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in cuprates and iridates."

The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), present from tabletop to astronomical scales, is an iconic example characterized by mushroom-shaped incursions appearing when immiscible fluids are forced together. Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the \"ripplon\" interface modes. Lastly, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain. These results-in agreement with our theory-demonstrate the close connection between the RTI in classical and quantum fluids."

Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. For well-chosen atomic species, the proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect."

Here, we report intrinsic superconductivity and normal-state transport properties in compressively strained La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films, achieved through a combination of isovalent Pr substitution, growth optimization, and precision ozone annealing. The superconducting onset occurs above 48 K, with zero resistance reached above 30 K, and the critical current density at 1.4 K is 100-fold larger than previous reports. The normal-state resistivity exhibits quadratic temperature dependence indicative of Fermi liquid behaviour, and other phenomenological similarities to transport in overdoped cuprates suggest parallels in their emergent properties."

To learn such models from data, a common approach involves sparse selection among a large function library.

To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory to suppress superfluous parameters. PASTIS outperforms existing methods and reliably identifies minimal models, even with low sampling rates or measurement error. It extends to stochastic partial differential equations, and applies to ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics."

The main result of the work is the derivation of the full expression for the thermoelectric current in a superconductor-quantum dot-superconductor junction for any values of the temperature difference between the superconducting leads. We show that in the linear response regime, in addition to the Josephson current, a weakly phase-dependent thermoelectric contribution occurs, provided that electron-hole symmetry is broken. Far from linearity, instead, other contributions arise which lead to thermoelectric effects, dominant at weak coupling, also in the presence of particle-hole symmetry."

We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems."

Additionally, the free energy function is augmented to be more versatile in capturing the transformation kinetics. The model is implemented into finite element software. To demonstrate the model performance and validate the implementation, material parameters are fitted to the experimental data of two SMA, and two computational simulations of SMA components are conducted. The applied approach is highly flexible from the perspective of the future incorporation of other phenomena, e.g., irreversibility associated with plasticity, into the model."

However little is known how to construct a fractional quantum Hall ground-state, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, that exists both in crystalline and disordered lattices and is qualitatively different to known topological phases. Here, we propose a general method for building such a phase. This is done by coupling quantum wires placed aperiodically in real-space, where the spatial positioning allows us to tune the inter-wire couplings. We call the emergent phase the Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect as it displays a rich interplay of fractional quantum Hall physics with fractonic constraints, formed by coupling differently-fractionalised wires into a globally gapped phase. The ground state has an exponential degeneracy in system size, a signature of the emergence of fractons. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), multiples of which can then hop between two wires (s-lineons) or be free to travel across the system (C-anyons), depending on the multiplicity. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires, which can be disordered. Our method provides an analytically solvable pathway to non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effects and fractonic theories in two-dimensions, examples of which were lacking."

We model the ferromagnetic particles in composite by spherical shells: the thickness of the ferromagnetic region $d$ compared to the particles' diameter $D$ can vary in a wide range, from $d\\ll D$ to $d\\sim D$. We assume that the magnetization distribution in such a particle is non-uniform, but forms a vortex-like structure: the magnetization is twisted in some plane outside two vortex cores placed at the poles of the particle. We consider two types of magnetic anisotropy, which help to stabilize such a magnetic configuration: the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy and the ``circular'' uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with easy axis rotated together with the magnetization direction outside the vortex core. The high-frequency permeability of such a composite material has been studied in the limit of non-interacting particles. We study the dependence of the permeability on the ratio $d/D$. We showed that for $d\\sim D$ the composite's permeability behaves in similar manner for both types of magnetic anisotropy. It was shown also that for the second type of magnetic anisotropy and in the limit $d/D\\ll1$ the frequency dependence of the particle's susceptibility is quite similar to that for the thin film. At the same time, the magnetization oscillations in the ac field are non-homogeneous for both types of anisotropy."

Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern."

In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems with real line gaps through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band-inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. The framework is also generalized to imaginary line-gapped topological phases. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms."

      "summary": "Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic modulation strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-Andr\\'{e}-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. We further examine the parameter space to determine the specific regimes that give rise to RL. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms."

A deterministic switching of N\\'{e}el vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that N\\'{e}el vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. Unlike previously studied spin torques induced by uniform or staggered spin accumulations -- where either the field-like or damping-like component dominates exclusively -- the asymmetric spin torque features cooperative contributions from both components, leading to N\\'{e}el vector dynamics that are fundamentally distinct from previous expectations. The switching conditions derived analytically agree well with simulation results and suggest various directions for further optimization. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced N\\'{e}el vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in antiferromagnetic spintronics."

Each point in the landscape is a configuration that can be unambiguously mapped to its inherent state, defined as the local minimum that the configuration will flow to under perfectly overdamped continuous dynamics. Typically, discrete in time dynamics are used to computationally find local minima, but it is not known whether these algorithms are capable of reliably finding inherent states. Here, we use steepest descent dynamics to find the distribution of the largest time step, $\\delta_\\textrm{best}$, which finds the inherent state. We find that for systems of $N$ particles, $\\delta_\\textrm{best}$ is approximately proportional to $N^{-3}$, and weakly dependent on d and $\\varphi$. We argue that the proportionality is due to saddle points in the energy landscape. Our results suggest that it is impossible, in practice, to reliably find inherent states for systems of about 64 particles or more."

We demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger system ($128\\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This \"train-small, generate-large\" capability offers a powerful and efficient alternative for studying critical phenomena. The method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems described by continuous fields on a lattice. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a powerful proposal generator in a hybrid scheme with MCMC, dramatically accelerating high-precision studies of the thermodynamic limit."

However, the impact of multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) on the multiple superconducting gaps remains not fully understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the multi-orbital electronic structure and superconducting gap properties of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals exhibit strong coupling to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the Sb-5pz orbitals show weak coupling to the out-of-plane vibrations of both Cs and the apical Sb atoms. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5."

Here, we demonstrate that mechanical strain fields contain sufficient information to reconstruct hidden chemical kinetics in coupled chemomechanical systems. Our partial differential equation-constrained learning framework decodes concentration-dependent diffusion kinetics, thermodynamic driving forces, and spatially heterogeneous reaction rates solely from mechanical observations. Using battery electrode materials as a model system, we demonstrate that the framework can accurately identify complex constitutive laws governing three distinct scenarios: classical Fickian diffusion, spinodal decomposition with pattern formation, and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions with spatial rate variations. The approach demonstrates robustness while maintaining accuracy with limited spatial data and reasonable experimental noise levels. Most significantly, the framework simultaneously infers multiple fundamental processes and properties, including diffusivity, reaction kinetics, chemical potential, and spatial heterogeneity maps, all from mechanical information alone. This method establishes a paradigm for materials characterization, enabling accurate learning of chemical processes in energy storage systems, catalysts, and phase-change materials where conventional diagnostics prove difficult. By revealing that mechanical deformation patterns serve as information-rich fingerprints of the underlying chemical processes, this work follows the pathway of inversely learning constitutive laws, with broad implications in materials science and engineering."

      "summary": "Ordered crystalline compounds exhibiting ultralow and glass-like thermal conductivity are both fundamentally and technologically important, where phonon quasi-particles dominate their heat transport. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms that govern such unusual transport behavior is necessary to unravel the complex interplay of crystal structure, phonons, and collective excitations of these quasi-particles. Here, we use state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on quantum density functional theory to investigate the origin of experimentally measured unusually low and glassy thermal conductivity in semiconducting TlAgTe. Utilizing a unifying framework of anharmonic lattice dynamics theory that combine phonon self-energy induced frequency renormalization, particle-like Peierls ($\\kappa_{l}^{P}$) and wave-like coherent ($\\kappa_{l}^{C}$) thermal transport contributions including three and four-phonon scattering channels, we successfully explain the experimental results both in terms of magnitude and temperature dependence. Our analysis reveals that TlAgTe exhibits several localized phonon modes arising from concerted rattling-like vibration of Tl atoms, which show strong temperature dependence and enhanced four-phonon scattering rates that are dominated by Umklapp processes, suppressing $\\kappa_{l}^{P}$ to ultralow values. The ensuing strong anharmonicity induced by local structural distortions, lone-pair electrons, and rattling-like vibrations of the heavy cations lead to a transition from particle-like behavior to wave-like tunneling characteristics of the phonon modes above 40 cm$^{-1}$, contributing significantly to $\\kappa_{l}^{C}$ which increases with temperature. Our analysis uncovers important structure-property relationship, which may be used in designing of novel materials with tunable thermal conductivity."

The network structure formed by this entanglement, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we utilize network science to investigate the entanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through experiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we demonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number of links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a giant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose a continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed transition. Additionally, we find that particle's opening angle significantly affects mechanical bonding and, consequently, the network structure. This work highlights the potential of network-based approaches to study entangled materials, paving the way for advancements in applications ranging from mechanical metamaterials to entangled robot swarms."

      "summary": "Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors represent a significant class of narrow band red-emitting materials, whose luminescent properties are profoundly influenced by electron-phonon coupling. However, the parity-forbidden nature of these electronic transition systems is incompatible with the conventional Condon approximation, which is widely adopted in the classic theories such as the Huang-Rhys theory, a framework established on the assumption of parity-allowed electric dipole transitions. This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding the principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic transitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent intensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly suppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To elucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden systems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment of the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers the physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order sidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is derived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2). This work not only reveals new findings regarding the phonon sidebands of the parity-forbidden electronic transition systems, but also establishes an improved theoretical framework for understanding the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms of color centers in solids."

      "summary": "Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as $1/\\tau$ or slower, where $\\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting."

In contrast, systematic studies on anionic doping to induce ferroelectricity remain largely in nascent stages. On epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ grown on ITO buffered YSZ substrates that crystallize in a mixed monoclinic (non-polar) and orthorhombic (polar) phases, we introduce nitrogen doping via post deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N$_2$ atmosphere at 900~$^\\circ$C. As the annealing time increases from 10s to 4min, the monoclinic phase fraction diminishes, enabling the emergence of well-defined ferroelectric loops in films annealed beyond 2~min. We clearly show that this is an effect of nitrogen incorporation (doping) into the samples through a suite of structure-property correlation measurements including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results reveal that nitrogen actively participates in the RTA-induced phase stabilization, enabling ferroelectricity in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ without sacrificing crystallographic coherence, providing a viable pathway for structure-property correlation studies and a model system to study opto-electronic devices integrated with ferroelectrics."

Using 2D moir\\'e structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced temperature gradient.

The framework is based on an interpretation of the multivariate information bottleneck, trading off the information preserved in an encoder graph (defining what to compress) against that in a decoder graph (defining a generative model for data). Using this approach, we rederive existing methods, including the deep variational information bottleneck, variational autoencoders, and deep multiview information bottleneck. We naturally extend the deep variational CCA (DVCCA) family to beta-DVCCA and introduce a new method, the deep variational symmetric information bottleneck (DVSIB). DSIB, the deterministic limit of DVSIB, connects to modern contrastive learning approaches such as Barlow Twins, among others. We evaluate these methods on Noisy MNIST and Noisy CIFAR-100, showing that algorithms better matched to the structure of the problem like DVSIB and beta-DVCCA produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy, dimensionality of the latent variables, sample efficiency, and consistently outperform other approaches under comparable conditions. Additionally, we benchmark against state-of-the-art models, achieving superior or competitive accuracy.

As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai and to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, which results in exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes. Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: This note introduces a novel paradigm for conformal defects with continuously adjustable dimensions. Just as the standard $\\varepsilon$ expansion interpolates between integer spacetime dimensions, a new parameter, $\\delta$, is used to interpolate between different integer-dimensional defects. The ensuing framework is explored in detail for defects of dimension $p=2+\\delta$ in both free and interacting $O(N)$ bulk conformal field theories (CFTs) in $d=4-\\varepsilon$. Comprehensive calculations are performed to first and second order in $\\varepsilon$ and to high or all orders in $\\delta$. Additionally, in the large-$N$ limit, the interpolation between defects of dimensions $p=1$ and $p=2$ is analysed for spacetime dimensions $4\\leq d\\leq 6$. The new parameter $\\delta$ provides a natural enrichment of the space of defect CFTs and allows to find new integer dimension or co-dimension defects."

To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, demonstrated structures in laser-induced pattern formation have been relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of nanofabrication techniques."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Recurrent Neural Network models have elucidated the interplay between structure and dynamics in biological neural networks, particularly the emergence of irregular and rhythmic activities in cortex. However, most studies have focused on networks with random or simple connectivity structures. Experimental observations find that high-order cortical connectivity patterns affect the temporal patterns of network activity, but a theory that relates such complex structure to network dynamics has yet to be developed. Here, we show that third- and higher-order cyclic correlations in synaptic connectivities greatly impact neuronal dynamics. Specifically, strong cyclic correlations in a network suppress chaotic dynamics and promote oscillatory or fixed activity. This change in dynamics is related to the form of the unstable eigenvalues of the random connectivity matrix. A phase transition from chaotic to fixed or oscillatory activity coincides with the development of a cusp at the leading edge of the eigenvalue support. We also relate the dimensions of activity to the network structure."

There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components."

As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation."

Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy is a technique to probe the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared wavelengths while detecting the upconverted signal at visible wavelengths. It has recently transitioned from large-area molecular films and colloidal suspensions to nanoscale structures, enabled by dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that confine light and matter in the same deep-subwavelength sensing volume. Here, we implement high-resolution ($<1$~cm$^{-1}$), continuous-wave ultra-broadband SFG and DFG spectroscopy from $860$ to $1670~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ on a variety of dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. The use of a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and the absence of geometric phase-matching requirements speed up and simplify data acquisition. At the same time, simultaneous access to SFG and DFG sidebands permits ratiometric signal analysis, enabling both common-noise rejection and field-normalized characterization of coherent response. The resulting spectra harbour the signatures of coherent interference between the resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the $\\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility, previously only observed under fs- and ps-pulsed excitation. We demonstrate the versatility and reproducibility of our approach across several molecules that yield distinct resonant and nonresonant mid-infrared responses. Moreover, we identify robust differences between our data and DFT calculations that hint at the modification of the infrared molecular response by the nanocavity environment. Together, these features position our platform as a scalable route toward multiplexed, high-resolution mid-IR sensing and a potential basis for coherent single- or few-molecule vibrational spectroscopy at the chip level."

The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating the dissipation along an alchemical switching process in terms of a nonadiabatic force field that can be learned through stochastic flow matching. The learned field can be used in conjunction with short-time trajectory data to evaluate upper and lower bounds on the alchemical free energy that variationally converge to the exact value if the field is optimal. Applying the method to evaluate the alchemical free energy of atomistic models shows that it can substantially reduce the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at negligible loss of accuracy when compared with thermodynamic integration."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Microbiomes are complex systems comprised of many interacting species. Species can survive harsh or changing conditions by rapid adaptation, a process accelerated by the exchange of genetic material between different species through horizontal gene transfer. Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species. Therefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a microbial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of antimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes. However, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally focused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates, overlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity of microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of positive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and diverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates population-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show that we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid to be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the conjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community. Then, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and conjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of positive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial communities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new perspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids."
