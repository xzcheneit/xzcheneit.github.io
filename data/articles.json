      "summary": "Hopfions are three-dimensional topological spin textures characterized by an integer topological invariant known as the Hopf index. The authors reveal here that magnetic hopfions give rise to a unique orbital Hall effect, producing transverse currents of orbital angular momentum in three dimensions. This response provides a clear electronic hallmark of hopfions, allowing them to be distinguished from related textures such as skyrmions. The three-dimensional transport behavior of hopfions originates from their noncollinear emergent field and underlying topology. [Phys. Rev. B 112, 134426] Published Wed Oct 15, 2025"

These results are achieved without optimizing parameters such as the bandwidth, power, and shape of the probing microwave field such that, with further improvements, sensitivities down to $\\mathrm{pT/\\sqrt{Hz}}$ can be envisioned. Our results motivate novel implementations of NV-based magnetic sensors with the potential for vectorial magnetic field detection at 1-10 kHz update rates and improved sensitivities without requiring a bias magnetic field."

      "summary": "Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable spin defects with great potential for nanoscale quantum sensing. A key application of NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among metals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and electrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies. However, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their quantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered diamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with different energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum properties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films. We find a substantial reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and a pronounced decrease of the NV$^{-}$ population for NV ensembles located near the platinum layer. As a result, optically detected magnetic resonance experiments could only be efficiently performed on diamonds implanted with at least 20 keV, where we observed a strong increase in the T$_{2}$ coherence time beneath the platinum thin films. Our study describes the various processes affecting NV centers near platinum films and provides guidance for the integration of thin metal films with near-surface NV centers."

In particular, the redundancy growth of the machine's wrapper language induces a Boltzmann--like exponential weighting over program lengths, yielding a canonical ensemble interpretation of algorithmic probability. This establishes a formal bridge between algorithmic information theory and statistical mechanics, in which the adopted UTM determines the intrinsic ``algorithmic temperature.'' We further show that this temperature approaches its maximal limit under the universal mixture (Solomonoff distribution), and discuss its epistemic meaning as the resolution level of an observer."

      "summary": "Stochastic processes with renewal properties are powerful tools for modeling systems where memory effects and long-time correlations play a significant role. In this work, we study a broad class of renewal processes where a variable's value changes according to a prescribed Probability Density Function (PDF), $p(\\xi)$, after random waiting times $\\theta$. This model is relevant across many fields, including classical chaos, nonlinear hydrodynamics, quantum dots, cold atom dynamics, biological motion, foraging, and finance. We derive a general analytical expression for the $n$-time correlation function by averaging over process realizations. Our analysis identifies the conditions for stationarity, aging, and long-range correlations based on the waiting time and jump distributions. Among the many consequences of our analysis, two new key results emerge. First, for Poissonian waiting times, the correlation function quickly approaches that of telegraphic noise. Second, for power-law waiting times with $\\mu>2$, , \\emph{any $n$-time correlation function asymptotically reduces to the two-time correlation evaluated at the earliest and latest time points}. This second result reveals a universal long-time behavior where the system's full statistical structure becomes effectively two-time reducible. Furthermore, if the jump PDF $p(\\xi)$ has fat tails, this convergence becomes independent of the waiting time PDF and is significantly accelerated, requiring only modest increases in either the number of realizations or the trajectory lengths. Building upon earlier work that established the universality of the two-point correlation function (i.e., a unique formal expression depending solely on the variance of $\\xi$ and on the waiting-time PDF), the present study extends that universality to the full statistical description of a broad class of renewal-type stochastic processes."

Here we demonstrate a strategy to realize epitaxial electrodeposition of iron (Fe) on single-crystal copper (Cu) substrates in aqueous electrolytes. We compare the electrodeposition behavior of Fe on polycrystalline and single-crystalline Cu substrates, revealing that the latter enables highly uniform, dense, and crystallographically aligned Fe growth. Comprehensive electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the formation of Fe with specific out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, including well-defined rotational variants. Our findings highlight that epitaxial electrodeposition of Fe can suppress dendritic growth and significantly enhance Coulombic efficiency during plating/stripping cycles. This approach bridges fundamental crystallography with practical electrochemical performance, providing a pathway toward high-efficiency aqueous batteries utilizing Earth-abundant materials."

      "summary": "Heavy-tailed fluctuations and power law statistics pervade physics, finance, and economics, yet their origin is often ascribed to systems poised near criticality. Here we show that such behavior can emerge far from instability through a universal mechanism of non-normal eigenvector amplification in multidimensional Kesten processes $x_{t+1}=A_t x_t+\\eta_t$, where $A_t$ are random interaction matrices and $\\eta_t$ represents external inputs, capturing the evolving interdependence among $N$ coupled components. Even when each random multiplicative matrix is spectrally stable, non-orthogonal eigenvectors generate transient growth that renormalizes the Lyapunov exponent and lowers the tail exponent, producing stationary power laws without eigenvalues crossing the stability boundary. We derive explicit relations linking the Lyapunov exponent and the tail index to the statistics of the condition number, $\\gamma\\!\\sim\\!\\gamma_0+\\ln\\kappa$ and $\\alpha\\!\\sim\\!-2\\gamma/\\sigma_\\kappa^2$, confirmed by numerical simulations. This framework offers a unifying geometric perspective that help interpret diverse phenomena, including polymer stretching in turbulence, magnetic field amplification in dynamos, volatility clustering and wealth inequality in financial systems. Non-normal interactions provide a collective route to scale-free behavior in globally stable systems, defining a new universality class where multiplicative feedback and transient amplification generate critical-like statistics without spectral criticality."

      "summary": "Tuning shear thickening behavior is a longstanding problem in the field of dense suspensions. Acoustic perturbations offer a convenient way to control shear thickening in real time, opening the door to a new class of smart materials. However, complete control over shear thickening requires a quantitative description for how suspension viscosity varies under acoustic perturbation. Here, we achieve this goal by experimentally probing suspensions with acoustic perturbations and incorporating their effect on the suspension viscosity into a universal scaling framework where the viscosity is described by a scaling function, which captures a crossover from the frictionless jamming critical point to a frictional shear jamming critical point. Our analysis reveals that the effect of acoustic perturbations may be explained by the introduction of an effective interparticle repulsion whose magnitude is roughly equal to the acoustic energy density. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this scaling framework may be leveraged to produce explicit predictions for the viscosity of a dense suspension under acoustic perturbation. Our results demonstrate the utility of the scaling framework for experimentally manipulating shear thickening systems."

Our experiments show that these memories coexist and compete within a limited memory capacity. A specific oscillatory amplitude, previously associated with a critical transition, suppresses the directional (fore-aft) asymmetry. A similar picture is known in amorphous solids. We propose that these competing kinds of memory are a motif for non-equilibrium systems coupled to a scalar drive and are a basic example of interplay between memories."

      "summary": "Strong disorder often has drastic consequences for quantum dynamics. This is best illustrated by the phenomenon of Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, where destructive quantum wave interference leads to the complete absence of particle and information transport over macroscopic distances. In this work, we investigate the extent to which strong disorder leads to provably slow dynamics in many-body quantum lattice models. We show that in any spatial dimension, strong disorder leads to a non-perturbatively small velocity for ballistic information transport under unitary quantum dynamics, almost surely in the thermodynamic limit, in every many-body state. In these models, we also prove the existence of a \"prethermal many-body localized regime\", where entanglement spreads logarithmically slowly, up to non-perturbatively long time scales. More generally, these conclusions hold for all models corresponding to quantum perturbations to a classical Hamiltonian obeying a simple non-resonant condition. Deterministic non-resonant models are found, including spin systems in strong incommensurate lattice potentials. Consequently, quantum dynamics in non-resonant potentials is asymptotically easier to simulate on both classical or quantum computers, compared to a generic many-body system."

Here we probe the topological robustness of the chiral Luttinger liquid at the boundary of the $\\nu=1/3$ state by measuring the tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes as a function of quantum point contact transmission. We demonstrate that for transmission $t\\geq 0.7$ the tunneling conductance is well-described by the first two terms of a perturbative series expansion corresponding to $g=1/3$. We further demonstrate that the measured scaling exponent is robustly pinned to $g=1/3$ across the plateau, only deviating as the bulk state becomes compressible. Finally we examine the impact of weak disorder on the scaling exponent, finding it insensitive. These measurements firmly establish the topological robustness of anyon tunneling at $\\nu=1/3$ and substantiate the chiral Luttinger liquid description of the edge mode."

While nanoscale energy transport under steady-state conditions has been studied extensively, there is much less known about energy transport under time-dependent driving forces, particularly in the far-from-equilibrium regime. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic thermodynamics to investigate energy transport in a well-studied nanoscale system, a molecular junction, subjected to a time-periodic temperature gradient. The primary observation is that molecular junctions can exhibit heat transport hysteresis, a phenomenon in which the heat flux through a system depends not only on the instantaneous value of a time-dependent temperature bias but also on the temporal history of that bias. The presented findings illustrate that molecular junctions can exhibit the specific memory effect, heat transport hysteresis, that is essential for the design of thermal neuromorphic computers. This work elucidates a potential pathway toward the realization of such devices."

      "summary": "Magnetically driven microparticles provide a versatile platform for probing and manipulating biological systems, yet the physical framework governing their actuation in complex environments remains only partially explored. Within the field of cellular magneto-mechanical stimulation, vortex microdiscs have emerged as particularly promising candidates for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we introduce a simplified two-dimensional model describing the magneto-mechanical response of such particles embedded in viscoelastic media under varying magnetic fields. Using a Maxwell description of the medium combined with simplified elasticity assumptions, we derive analytical expressions and support them with numerical simulations of particle motion under both oscillating and rotating magnetic fields. Our results show that rotating fields typically induce oscillatory dynamics and that the transition to asynchronous motion occurs at a critical frequency determined by viscosity and stiffness. The amplitude and phase of this motion is governed by the competition between magnetic and viscoelastic contributions, with particle motion being strongly impaired when the latter dominate. Energy-based considerations further demonstrate that, within the frequency range explored of few tens of Hertz, no heat is generated -- distinguishing this approach from magnetic hyperthermia -- while the elastic energy transferred to the surrounding medium is, in principle, sufficient to perturb major cellular processes. This work provides a simple framework to anticipate the first-order influence of rheological properties on magnetically driven microdisc dynamics, thereby enabling a better understanding of their impact in cells or extracellular materials and bridging the gap between experimental observations and theoretical modelling."

The thermal conductivity of the GaN channel and AlN buffer layers is measured by thermoreflectance (TTR). A pronounced thickness dependence of thermal conductivity as a result of phonon-boundary scattering is observed at low temperatures, while this effect becomes significantly weaker at elevated temperatures. The thermal boundary resistance (TBR) at the AlN/4H-SiC and GaN/AlN interfaces is also examined, showing a substantial reduction and eventual saturation with increasing temperature, indicating elastic phonon transport as the dominant mechanism. Reliable simulations of the temperature profile across the structures based on the measured thermal metrics highlight the critical role of TBR in thin-channel device and the advantage of thicker channel and buffer layers for efficient heat dissipation in the HEMTs."

Self-healing of defects provides a promising pathway to prolong device functionality, yet the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly the role of interfacial chemistry on trap dynamics and healing kinetics. Here, we elucidate self-healing and defect evolution in triple-cation mixed halide (TCMH) perovskite films and their device-relevant charge transport layer heterostructures subjected to photo-induced damage. Using correlation clustering imaging (CLIM), our recently developed local functional imaging tool, we map spatiotemporal photoluminescence heterogeneity to track defect dynamics in pristine and heterostructure films. The defect healing follows bi-phasic kinetics, with an initial electronic relaxation (tens of minutes) and a subsequent slower phase (~ hours) associated to ionic and lattice rearrangement. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the chemical nature of charge-transport layers modulates trap activity, healing kinetics, and halide redistribution, with heterostructures exhibiting faster recovery than pristine films, a boon for device resilience. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic interaction between defects, interfaces, and ion migration, and establish a framework for rational design of durable, next-generation perovskite optoelectronic devices."

Lateral photoconductors generally require a large size, in the mm2, and are limited in operation speed due to the presence of trapping sites. In contrast, hybrid phototransistors are fabricated in the um2 scale and benefit from such trapping sites, allowing the measurement of low light levels in the nW/cm2. The question, however, arises whether high responsivity values are required for the detection of low light levels or the compatible detectivity of photoconductors is sufficient. Here, we directly compare photoconductors and hybrid phototransistors with an identical EDT-treated PbS cQD film. We highlight that a comparable D* is not enough for the purpose of measuring low light levels, as the resulting photocurrents need to be readily accessible. Furthermore, we also showcase temperature-activated photocurrent dynamics resulting in a negative photocurrent (NPC) effect. This NPC simultaneously improves the frequency bandwidth and photocurrent, enabling operation speeds up to 100 kHz."

Progress in this topic has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density ($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$ devices with varying long-range ($n_\\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range ($n_\\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the magnitude of $n_\\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\\mathrm{SR} \\lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\\mathrm{SR} \\gg n_e$ these features are suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher $n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a combined experimental-theoretical approach."

Using the chemotaxis of E. coli in agar gels as a model system, we uncover a universal trade-off between persistence and obstacle avoidance that dictates optimal search strategies. We find that populations evolving under pressure for rapid expansion adapt by shortening their mean run time ({\\tau}_f), counter to the intuition that longer runs always favor faster migration. Controlled experiments with a tunable strain confirm a non-monotonic relationship between run time and chemotactic velocity, with a clear optimum that shifts with environmental trap density. At the single-agent level, we identify and characterize a key motility state: transient trapping in the gel's pores. A minimal theoretical model, integrating run-tumble and run-trap dynamics, explains the optimum as a consequence of the antagonistic scaling of the diffusion coefficient (increasing with {\\tau}_f) and the chemotactic bias coefficient (decreasing with {\\tau}_f). This work establishes a general principle for the optimization of active matter transport in complex and obstructed environments."

      "summary": "The interplay between moir\\'e flat bands originating from different valleys can give rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases. In this work, we investigate the electronic properties of twisted mono-bilayer (A-AB) and mono-trilayer (A-ABA) MoTe$_2$ using first-principles calculations and continuum models. Unlike previous studies on twisted bilayer systems, in which low-energy flat bands originate solely from the $K/K'$ valleys, in A-AB and A-ABA twisted MoTe$_2$ (\\tmt) the moir\\'e bands at low energies arise from both the $\\Gamma$ and $K/K'$ valleys, with spin Chern numbers $C_s=0$ (for $\\Gamma$) and $C_{\\uparrow/\\downarrow}=\\pm1$ (for $K/K'$), respectively. We show that the multi-valley moir\\'e flat bands are governed by interlayer-hybridization effects, and that different stacking configurations and thicknesses tune the relative energy alignment between the $\\Gamma$ and $K$ valley moir\\'e flat bands. By constructing valley-resolved continuum models and performing Wannierization for the low-energy moir\\'e bands, we further uncover that the Berry curvature and quantum metric distributions can be effectively tuned by the layer number and stacking configuration. Unlike other moir\\'e systems, where only one kind of valley influenced the low energy physics, the simultaneous appearance of two distinct types of valleys, with different symmetries, establish A-AB and A-ABA \\tmt\\ as ideal platforms for studying layer-controlled multi-valley physics."

      "summary": "Platinum step edges dominate electrocatalytic activity in fuel cells and electrolysers, yet their atomistic electrochemical behaviour remains poorly understood. Here, we employ \\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics under controlled electrode potentials to model a realistic stepped Pt--water interface incorporating experimentally observed (111)$\\times$(111) and (111)$\\times$(100) edge motifs. This allows us to resolve, for the first time, the site-specific structure, charge distribution, and electrostatics of the electric double layer at a nanostructured Pt surface. We find that differential capacitance near the potential of zero charge (PZC) arises almost entirely from potential-dependent chemisorption of water on flat (111) terraces. In contrast, step edges are saturated with chemisorbed water even below the PZC and thus do not contribute to the capacitance. Instead, edges accumulate excess positive charge and exhibit a locally elevated electrostatic potential, as revealed by spatially resolved macroscopic potential profiles. This electrostatic asymmetry implies a greater barrier for electron accumulation at step sites compared to terraces, consistent with enhanced charge localisation and reactivity. Finally, the higher-in-energy d-band centre and sharper projected density of states at edge atoms further support their role as active, positively charged centres. Together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed experimental shift of the PZC with step density and establish a predictive framework for understanding and optimising interfacial charging in nanostructured Pt electrocatalysts."

      "summary": "We show that the initialization of an ensemble of electrons in the same spin state in strained n-InGaAs subject to a perpendicular magnetic field triggers an AC electric current at GHz frequencies. The AC current emerges in the absence of any driving force and survives until the coherent precession of the electron spins is lost. The current amplitude increases linearly with both the spin-orbit coupling strength and the external magnetic field. The generation mechanism of the observed oscillatory charge motion can be fruitfully described in terms of the periodic trembling motion of spin-polarized electrons, which is a solid-state analog to the Zitterbewegung of free Dirac electrons. Our results demonstrate that the hidden consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics is realized and can be studied in a rather simple solid-state system at moderate temperatures. Furthermore, the large amplitude of the AC current at high magnetic fields enables ultra-fast spin sensitive electric read-out in solids."

      "summary": "Organic surface ligands are integral components of nanocrystals and nanoparticles that have a strong influence on their physicochemical properties, their interaction with the environment, and their ability to self-assemble and order into higher-order structures. These hybrid nanomaterials are tunable with applications in catalysis, directed self-assembly, next-generation optoelectronics, and chemical and quantum sensing. Critically, future advances depend on our ability to rationally engineer their surface chemistry. However, fundamental knowledge of ligand-nanoparticle behavior is limited by uncertainty in where and how these ligands bind to surfaces. For nanoparticles, in particular, few characterization techniques offer both the high spatial resolution and the precise chemical mapping needed to identify specific ligand binding sites. In this study, we utilized synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) together with first-principles computer simulations to validate the site-selective adsorption of organic ligands on a shaped nanocrystal surface. Specifically, we demonstrate that the sterically encumbered isocyanide ligands (CNAr^{Mes2}) preferentially bind to the high curvature features of Ag nanocubes (NCs), where low-coordinate Ag atoms are present. In contrast, isocyanide ligands that do not exhibit these steric properties show no surface selectivity. SINS serves as an effective tool to validate these surface binding interactions at the near-single molecule level. These results indicate that steric effects can be successfully harnessed to design bespoke organic ligands for fine-tuning nanocrystal surface chemistry and the properties of the nanocrystal ligand shell."

      "summary": "Antiferromagnetic materials are promising platforms for the development of ultra-fast spintronics and magnonics due to their robust magnetism, high-frequency relativistic dynamics, low-loss transport, and the ability to support topological textures. However, achieving deterministic control over antiferromagnetic order in thin films is a major challenge, due to the formation of multi-domain states stabilised by competing magnetic and destressing interactions. Thus, the successful implementation of antiferromagnetic materials necessitates careful engineering of their anisotropy. Here, we demonstrate strain-based robust control over multiple antiferromagnetic anisotropies and nanoscale domains in the promising spintronic candidate a-Fe2O3, at room temperature. By applying isotropic and anisotropic in-plane strains across a broad temperature-strain phase space, we systematically tune the interplay between magneto-crystalline and magneto-elastic interactions. We discover that strain-driven control steers the system towards an aligned antiferromagnetic state, whilst preserving topological spin textures, such as merons, antimerons and bimerons. We directly map the nanoscale antiferromagnetic order using linear dichroic scanning transmission X-ray microscopy integrated with in situ strain and temperature control. A Landau model and micromagnetic simulations reveal how strain reshapes the magnetic energy landscape. These findings suggest that strain could serve as a versatile control mechanism to reconfigure equilibrium or dynamic antiferromagnetic states on demand in a-Fe2O3, paving the way for next-generation spintronic and magnonic devices."

      "summary": "We investigate the dynamics of an inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle suspended in a non-Markovian environment. The particle is additionally subjected to external forces, such as harmonic confinement and a magnetic field. Motivated by the importance of understanding the non-Markovian behavior of complex environments, we examine the impact of a viscoelastic medium by employing the Jeffrey fluid framework for modeling the particle motion, which effectively captures both viscous and elastic contributions of the environment. Within this model, we explicitly derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for each case. Building on this, we extend the analysis to general non-Markovian framework and derive the corresponding generalized Fokker-Planck equation for a free active particle. Furthermore, we obtain the probability distribution function valid for arbitrary memory kernel under various conditions, including both free and confined motion with and without a magnetic field. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first attempt to establish such a comprehensive formalism for the probabilistic description of an active particle subjected to non-Markovian memory effects. This formulation provides a solid basis for analyzing the dynamics of an active particle in a non-Markovian environment, such as mucus and polymer solutions, and further allows the study of relaxation in confined geometries and responses to external fields."

The quest to understand the governing principles of RP nickelate superconductivity has become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we report a critical advance by synthesizing and investigating a distinct structural polymorph of the same compound: the monolayer-trilayer (1313) hybrid phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Under high pressure, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic $Cmmm$ to the tetragonal $P4/mmm$ space group at 13~GPa. Above 19 GPa, the phase exhibits a clear superconducting transition, confirmed by a zero-resistance state, albeit at a significantly reduced temperature of 3.6 K. The stark contrast with the 80 K transition in the bilayer phase provides a uniquely clean experimental comparison. Our results demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature is directly governed by the nature of the interlayer coupling, and the bilayer NiO$_6$ block as the essential structural motif for achieving high-$T_\\text{c}$ superconductivity in the RP nickelates."

      "summary": "A general class of dynamical systems which can be trained to operate in classification and generation modes are introduced. A procedure is proposed to plant asymptotic stationary attractors of the deterministic model. Optimizing the dynamical system amounts to shaping the architecture of inter-nodes connection to steer the evolution towards the assigned equilibrium, as a function of the class to which the item - supplied as an initial condition - belongs to. Under the stochastic perspective, point attractors are turned into probability distributions, made analytically accessible via the linear noise approximation. The addition of noise proves beneficial to oppose adversarial attacks, a property that gets engraved into the trained adjacency matrix and therefore also inherited by the deterministic counterpart of the optimized stochastic model. By providing samples from the target distribution as an input to a feedforward neural network (or even to a dynamical model of the same typology of the adopted for classification purposes), yields a fully generative scheme. Conditional generation is also possible by merging classification and generation modalities. Automatic disentanglement of isolated key features is finally proven."

Here we analyze how an external imprinting or the thermal fluctuations of the condensate phase influence this expansion. In both cases, we find that the curved geometry filters the imploding finite angular-momentum modes via a radial centrifugal potential, so that only the condensate state can reach the origin and form the central peak. As a consequence, we observe a pronounced dependence of the central density on the imprinting strength and on temperature. This geometric filtering effect characterizes the free expansion of curved atomic gases in contrast with flat counterparts, it is easily observable in the available experimental platforms, and enables two-dimensional shells thermometry via simple absorption-imaging techniques."

      "summary": "Efficient exploration of the vast chemical space is a fundamental challenge in materials discovery, particularly for designing functional inorganic crystalline materials with targeted properties. Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as a powerful route, but most existing approaches require domain-specific constraints and separate diffusion processes for atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters, adding complexity and limiting efficiency. Here, we present DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that generates complete crystal structures in a single, end-to-end diffusion process. This unified framework simplifies the model architecture and accelerates sampling by two to three orders of magnitude compared to existing methods without compromising chemical and structural diversity of the generated materials. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of DiffCrysGen in generating valid and useful materials, using density functional theory (DFT), we validate a number of newly generated rare earth-free magnetic materials that are energetically and dynamically stable, and are potentially synthesizable. These include ferromagnets with high saturation magnetization and large magnetocrystalline anisotropy, as also metallic antiferromagnets. These results establish DiffCrysGen as a general platform for accelerated functional materials discovery."

In this study, we investigate the large positive magneto-thermal conductance associated with the gravitational anomaly -- one of the predicted anomalies -- for a Weyl semimetal based on a compressively strained HgTe layer. We clearly identify the Weyl regime in our device and accurately extract the thermal conductance by performing thermometry measurements at liquid helium temperatures using fully electronic methods. We observe the anticipated increase in thermal conductance, and it perfectly matches the electrical conductance according to the Wiedemann-Franz law. This finding indicates that, despite the unique electronic spectrum of Weyl semimetals, the mechanism governing heat transport in this system is the same as that for electrical transport, with no additional violations of conservation laws."

Realization of altermagnetism in the two-dimensional (2D) limit remains an outstanding challenge because dimensional reduction suppresses kZ dispersion and destabilizes the symmetry operations essential for spin compensation. Here, we demonstrate genuine 2D altermagnetism in epitaxial unit-cell-thin films of CrSb grown on Bi2Te3. It reveals a thickness-driven transition from a ferrimagnetic state in 1-unit-cell films to an altermagnetic state above a critical thickness of 7/4 unit cell. The transition originates from interfacial symmetry breaking at the Cr-terminated layer that induces local moment imbalance. With increasing thickness the key spin-space-group symmetries [C2||C6Zt] and [C2||MZ] restores, which leads to altermagnetism with zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin splitting. Our results provide the first experimental realization of altermagnetism in the 2D regime and establish a route for integrating stray-field-free spin order into nanoscale spintronic architectures."

The relationship between these phases remains poorly understood. This work systematically explores their connection in ZrTe$_5$ through rotatable, pressure-dependent measurements. At ambient pressure, both phases are observed; the WSM phase requires strong electronic polarization, while the 3D QH phase appears when the characteristic resistivity peak temperature $T_p$ is approximately 90 K. Under applied pressure, the polarization diminishes, weakening the WSM phase and its associated nontrivial Hall signals. Concurrently, $T_p$ rises dramatically from 2 K at ambient pressure to 70 K at 2.2 GPa, approaching the expected regime for the 3D QH phase. These findings clarify the conditions underlying the WSM and 3D QH phases and suggest that exploring the 3D QH phase at even higher pressures is a promising direction for future research."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are versatile platforms for tailoring electronic and magnetic properties, in which the insertion of chemical species into their interlayer gaps offers a powerful route to engineer magnetism. Here, we focus on the A-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$ (T$_N$ = 38 K) and investigate its electronic and magnetic properties upon intercalation of lithium (Li$^+$) and organic tetrabutylammonium (TBA$^+$) ions using first-principles calculations. Our results show that Li$^+$ incorporation induces a semiconductor-to-metal transition in CrPS$_4$ and selectively modifies its magnetic behaviour: switching from out-of-plane to in-plane antiferromagnetism, followed by an in-plane ferromagnetic ground state at higher intercalation levels. This is accompanied by a continuous increase of the ordering temperature, reaching a fivefold enhancement for Li$_{0.5}$CrPS$_4$. Similarly, TBA$^+$ intercalation expands the vdW gap, decoupling CrPS$_4$ layers and stabilising in-plane ferromagnetism with a T$_C$ above 100 K. Furthermore, it also modifies magnon propagation, leading to enhanced group velocities and a more isotropic magnon transport. This work highlights intercalation as a powerful and versatile approach for controlling magnetic behaviour and spin dynamics, paving the way for the design of tunable 2D layered magnetic materials for spintronic and magnonic applications."

Following the experimental setup that produced quantum droplets for the first time, we work with squeezed drops that are compressed in one direction. By squeezing the drops even more, towards a quasi-two dimensional geometry, we study the minimum atom number able to show a stable vortex and obtain that this number is significantly smaller than previous predictions for spherical droplets. The reduction of the critical atom number for forming a stable vortex could make their experimental observation in these droplets, which is still lacking, more feasible. Contrary to results obtained in heteronuclear mixtures, where the energetically preferred vortices are partially filled with the species not participating in the rotation, our results show a relevant stability island of fully empty vortices. Increasing the number of particles in the drop and the speed of rotation, we estimate the transition line between empty and filled vortices."

In this work, we investigate the influence of H2Pc molecules on CVD-grown MoS2 and WS2 monolayers using correlative microscopy techniques - Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), photoluminescence (PL), and Raman spectroscopy. Comprehensive analysis of both electronic and optical properties provides detailed insights into the energy band alignment in these two HS. Despite their similar band alignments, the heterostructures exhibit strikingly different optical signatures. In the case of H2Pc/MoS2 HS, the effect of defect healing is more pronounced, while for the H2Pc/WS2 HS, strong indications of F\\\"orster energy transfer are observed. These findings highlight the critical role of transition dipole moment in addition to spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption in the design of optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids provides a powerful platform to probe ultrafast electron dynamics and interband--intraband coupling. However, disentangling the complex many-body contributions in the HHG spectrum remains challenging. Here we introduce a machine-learning approach based on a Transformer encoder to analyze and reconstruct HHG signals computed from a one-dimensional Kronig--Penney model. The self-attention mechanism inherently highlights correlations between temporal dipole dynamics and high-frequency spectral components, allowing us to identify signatures of nonadiabatic band coupling that are otherwise obscured in standard Fourier analysis. By combining attention maps with Gabor time--frequency analysis, we extract and amplify weak coupling channels that contribute to even-order harmonics and anomalous spectral features. Our results demonstrate that multi-head self-attention acts as a selective filter for strong-coupling events in the time domain, enabling a physics-informed interpretation of high-dimensional quantum dynamics. This work establishes Transformer-based attention as a versatile tool for solid-state strong-field physics, opening new possibilities for interpretable machine learning in attosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear photonics."

Two-dimensional (2D) materials have become the most promising exploration target due to their exceptional electronic properties and scalability. In this work, we conducted device transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary semiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The results demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5.7 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still exhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and surpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve the required on-state current of 900 {\\mu}A/{\\mu}m under low operating voltages of 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's subthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching an astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor performance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the channel length is 7.9 nm. Our research not only showcases the exceptional transistor properties of Na2LiAlP2 but also further expands the research scope of 2D high-performance transistors."

We present a numerically efficient framework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a multi-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary shape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is based on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the Green's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within a few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without requiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the full numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located in the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is easily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities."

Chalgogenide materials have applications in phase change random access memory (PCRAM) due to their ability to reversibly cycle between crystalline and amorphous states, and of these materials Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is of particular interest due to its speed, stability and low crystallisation temperatures. GST possesses two stable crystalline polymorphs, cubic and hexagonal (trigonal system). Studies show that phenomena such as heat transport and thermal lattice expansion drive the phase-change nature of these materials. These phenomena are not incorporated in the harmonic approximation, which is a popular model for describing vibrations in solids. Through ab initio density functional theory (DFT), we computationally investigate the anharmonic behaviour of pristine GST, without vacancies or defects, while considering the various stacking models that exist and inclusion of van der Waals (vdW) interactions in our modelling. We present the vibrational analysis of different stacking models in GST; Petrov and Kooi-De Hosson (KDH) models and the quantification anharmonic behaviour. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating anharmonic and dispersion effects when modelling GST, especially in the choice of stacking models, along with implications for phenomena relating to phase-change behaviour."

      "summary": "Phonon transport near nanoscale hotspots (NHs) critically determines heat dissipation in advanced electronic devices. The prevailing understanding is that the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long mean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size, thereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat effectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture mode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon populations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near NHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of long-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons heat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient near the NH and thereby enhancing TR. By resolving the spectral contributions to the phonon transport resistance and temperature gradients, we identify the critical role of the modal specific heat in nonlocal phonon transport. These results provide new physical insights into nanoscale thermal management and highlight the importance of spectral mode resolution in modeling heat dissipation in electronic devices."

The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) framework predicts that extensions incorporating conserved currents or temporally correlated noise give rise to distinct growth morphologies and universality classes, yet direct experimental realization has remained elusive. Here, we report atomically resolved Sn thin-film growth on Sb-doped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, revealing a sharp dynamical crossover between two fundamentally different regimes. Early stage growth follows conserved KPZ scaling, forming two-dimensional islands and stanene layers. Beyond a critical deposition time, temporally correlated noise dominates, driving the nucleation of $\\alpha$ -Sn clusters, their evolution into faceted grains, and coexistence with faceted $\\beta$-Sn. Molecular dynamics simulation and Auger electron spectroscopy show adatom escape as the microscopic origin of temporally correlated noise, providing a microscopic mechanism for the universality crossover. These findings establish, for the first time, that temporal noise correlations can fundamentally alter the scaling class of a growing interface, linking atomistic kinetics to emergent universal behavior."

Typically, the answer to this question is sought in quantum correlations.

To this end, we develop a comprehensive thermodynamic description of nonlinear qubits starting with identifying the proper thermodynamic equilibrium state. We then show that for ideal cycles as well as at maximum power the efficiency of the nonlinear engine is significantly higher. Interestingly, nonlinear dynamics can be thought of as an effective description of a correlated, complex quantum many body system. Hence, our findings corroborate common wisdom, while at the same time propose a new design of more efficient quantum engines."

Here, on the basis of systematic investigations for the hole doped single-layer Haldane-Hubbard(HH) model, we propose a new bilayer HH model to realize the compensated odd-parity spin splitting and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity where the two layers are connected by the time reversal transformation. Our results show that the vanishing layer-dependent electric potential $V_{L}$ gives rise to odd-parity ALM protected by the combined symmetry $TM_{xy}$ with $T$ and $M_{xy}$ being the time reversal and mirror reflection perpendicular to $z$ axis, and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity simultaneously. In addition, though the staggered magnetization within each layer is substantially impacted by the layer-dependent electric potential, small $V_{L}$'s only bring negligible changes to the net magnetization and the spin Hall conductivity, indicating that the alternating spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity are insusceptible to external elements. Most importantly, our work provides a general framework for the simultaneous realization of the compensated odd-parity spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity in collinear magnets, in terms of stacked multi-layer systems."

However, unlike their non-magnetic counterparts, where the surface spin-momentum locking prevents electrons from being scattered by non-magnetic impurities and results in a dissipationless electronic flow, magnetic impurities in MTIs cause dissipation by exerting magnetic torque on the electron spin. Decreasing this resistance is desired to reduce energy consumption and optimize performance of MTIs in envisaged applications. Here we reveal how electronic backscattering can be suppressed in a MTI thin film by external magnetic and/or electronic stimuli, to yield an entirely dissipationless spin-polarized charge transport. Our findings thus present an effective route to preserve spin coherence and enhance spin-current functionality in magnetic topological materials, suggesting design strategies for magneto-electronic and spintronic devices with strongly reduced energy consumption."

Above 40 K, the susceptibilities show the large, broad peaks associated with a quantum spin-singlet ground state and large singlet-triplet gaps of 21 meV and 25 meV. Monte Carlo simulations, density matrix renormalization-group calculations for finite spin-3/2 chains, and density functional theory reproduce the experimental behavior, confirming the interplay between strong one-dimensional intrachain and weak three-dimensional interchain couplings. MoX3 offers a unique platform for exploring quantum magnetism and magnetic excitations at the atomic chain limit, as these materials combine a 1D van der Waals motif, spin chain behavior, and classical interchain order."

      "summary": "The global transition to hydrogen-based energy infrastructures faces significant hurdles. Chief among these are the high costs and sustainability issues associated with acid-based proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Anion exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells offer promising cost-effective alternatives, yet their widespread adoption is limited by rapid degradation in alkaline environments. Here, we develop a framework that integrates mechanistic insights with machine learning, enabling the identification of generalized degradation behavior across diverse polymeric AEM chemistries and operating conditions. Our model successfully predicts long-term hydroxide conductivity degradation (up to 10,000 hours) from minimal early-time experimental data. This capability significantly reduces experimental burdens and may expedite the design of high-performance, durable AEM materials."

Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature after the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For a thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate equilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of additional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy of necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical ensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric interpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner product: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench Hamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal complement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results numerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable models."

      "summary": "Although iron molybdate (Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$) has been commercially utilized for the production of formaldehyde from methanol via oxidative dehydrogenation, the detailed mechanism during the catalytic process remains unclear. Recent operando Raman and impedance measurements of the reaction suggested that the bulk region of Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ acts as a reservoir of oxygen atoms that can migrate to the surface to participate in catalysis. This conclusion was drawn from the observed significant reduction in Raman intensity during the catalytic process which implies the formation of atomic defects. However, the microscopic origin of this reduction remains to be clarified. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the origin of the experimentally observed Raman intensity variation. Our phonon analysis reveals that oxygen-dominated vibrational modes, with a small Mo contribution, occur near 782 cm$^{-1}$-the same frequency region where the Raman intensity reduction was measured. Using an effective frozen-phonon approach, we further demonstrate that oxygen vibrations are primarily responsible for the decrease in calculated Raman intensity. Moreover, structural relaxation of Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ including an oxygen vacancy suggests that oxygen diffusion from the bulk to the surface should occur without significant alteration of the local symmetry, consistent with the absence of measurable peak shifts or broadening in the experimental Raman spectra."

In the immiscible case, random domains form, and their number, boundary length, and average size at the point of equilibration follow universal Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling with the cooling rate. These patterns continue to evolve in a self-similar way while maintaining KZ scaling. In the miscible regime, instead of domains, vortices appear, following the KZ scaling. The spatial distribution of domains and vortices is described by a Poisson point process with the KZ density. These findings highlight robust, universal features of how binary superfluids behave far from equilibrium, extending beyond the KZ theory."

      "summary": "In many unconventional superconductors, the strange-metal regime is thought to emerge from quantum criticality, yet in cuprates this link is obscured by the enigmatic pseudogap. Superconducting infinite-layer nickelates provide a new arena to test this paradigm but are constrained to thin films, precluding calorimetry. We use the Seebeck coefficient as a low-temperature proxy for entropy per carrier and uncover a clear quantum-critical thermodynamic signature: in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at the onset of $T$-linear resistivity ($x=0.20$), $S/T$ diverges logarithmically upon cooling, $S/T \\propto \\log T$. Boltzmann transport based on ARPES-derived band structure reproduces the high-temperature magnitude and sign of $S/T$ and reveals a threefold mass renormalization at the Fermi level. To identify the terminating phase, we analyze Hall data across Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ and show that its temperature evolution is quantitatively captured by a minimal two-band model in which a strongly correlated Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface exhibits Planckian $T$-linear scattering while the rare-earth Nd-$s$ pocket remains Fermi-liquid-like. Inverting the zero-temperature Hall response reveals a collapse of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band carrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes across the critical doping, without long-range magnetic order -- mirroring the cuprate pseudogap transition in cuprates. These results establish a quantum critical point at the end of a pseudogap-like phase in infinite-layer nickelates and unify the broader paradigm among correlated superconductors that strange metal behaviour is intimately linked to quantum criticality."

In contrast to the widely used aluminum(Al)-based hybrids, lead(Pb) offers a bulk superconducting gap of ~1.4meV and a critical temperature of ~7.2K, giving rise to a proximity-induced gap that is roughly five times larger than that obtained with Al. Here we present the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal measurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and the large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a switch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the induced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo singlet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve gate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance, identifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations of quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and can be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the feasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust nonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating temperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap, thereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the suitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial Kitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially larger topological gap."

      "summary": "The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly."

Metal oxide materials are promising candidates for fabricating flexible neuromorphic electronics, but suffer from processing constraints due to the incompatibilities between oxides and polymer substrates. In this work, we use photonic curing to fabricate flexible metal-insulator-metal capacitors with solution-processible aluminum oxide dielectric tailored for neuromorphic applications. Because photonic curing outcomes depend on many input parameters, identifying an optimal processing condition through a traditional grid-search approach is unfeasible. Here, we apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to determine photonic curing conditions that optimize the trade-off between desired electrical properties of large capacitance-frequency dispersion and low leakage current. Furthermore, we develop a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework for incorporating failed experiments into the MOBO machine learning workflow, demonstrating that this framework accelerates optimization by reducing the number of experimental rounds required. Once optimization is concluded, we analyze different Pareto-optimal conditions to tune the dielectrics properties and provide insight into the importance of different inputs through Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis. The demonstrated framework of combining MOBO with HITL feedback can be adapted to a wide range of multi-objective experimental problems that have interconnected inputs and high experimental failure rates to generate usable results for machine learning models."

This establishes a path toward need-based parts maintenance driven by accurate damage assessments instead of relying on regularly scheduled maintenance teardowns, extending the service intervals of structures operating in harsh environments. To this end, we encapsulate magnetoelastic and thermomagnetic materials inside microtubes and embed the sensing elements during additive manufacturing. Mechanical and thermal stimuli affect the magnetic permeability of the embedded materials, which modulates the impedance of a coil placed on or near the surface of the printed part. We demonstrate strain sensing accurate to +/-27x10-6 over at least a 6x10-4 strain range, and temperature sensing accurate to +/-0.75oC over a 70oC range, both to a 95% confidence interval. We highlight these sensors' capabilities by detecting the onset of plasticity and fatigue-driven crack growth thousands of cycles before critical failure. This extends non-destructive eddy-current damage detection to accurate, real-time strain and temperature monitoring within metallic structures."

      "summary": "Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation under constant stress, known as creep, which can lead to rupture or static fatigue. A common misconception is that materials under tolerable static loads remain unaffected over time. Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental creep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like springs and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the power-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional calculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship; however, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the deformation rate evolves over time. This article introduces a variable-order (VO) springpot model that dynamically adapts to the evolving viscoelastic properties of polymeric materials during creep, capturing changes between glassy, transition and rubbery phases. Model parameters are calibrated using a robust procedure for model identification based on the cross-entropy (CE) method, resulting in physically consistent and accurate predictions. This advanced modelling framework not only overcomes the limitations of the fixed-order models but also establishes a foundation for applying VO mechanics to other viscoelastic materials, providing a valuable tool for predicting long-term material performance in structural applications."

      "summary": "Variational wavefunctions offer a practical route around the exponential complexity of many-body Hilbert spaces, but their expressive power is often sharply constrained. Matrix product states, for instance, are efficient but limited to area law entangled states. Neural quantum states (NQS) are widely believed to overcome such limitations, yet little is known about their fundamental constraints. Here we prove that feed-forward neural quantum states acting on $n$ spins with $k$ scalar nonlinearities, under certain analyticity assumptions, obey a bound on entanglement entropy for any subregion: $S \\leq c k\\log n$, for a constant $c$. This establishes an NQS analog of the area law constraint for matrix product states and rules out volume law entanglement for NQS with $O(1)$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the scaling with $n$ is tight for a wide variety of NQS. Our work establishes a fundamental constraint on NQS that applies broadly across different network designs, while reinforcing their substantial expressive power."

      "summary": "We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter."

      "summary": "Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces."

      "summary": "Non-destructive characterization of lithium-ion batteries provides critical insights for optimizing performance and lifespan while preserving structural integrity. Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires consideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial distribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing non-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution, and degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise observation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ neutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of view 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and distribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature accelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission attenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the two stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating non-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss and liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying. Further analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron transmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of hydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying does not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively decoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal that high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while low EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss. This study unveils a dynamic electrolyte infiltration-consumption-dry-out process in LIBs, offering non-destructive and quantitative insights to guide sustainable and durable battery development."

By integrating large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems."

These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals."

In this work, we develop an analysis of a local inversion symmetry broken fluid flow model through an undulating microchannel. Surface undulations of a few tens of Hertz in a soft microchannel keep the fluid flow in a low Reynolds number regime, allowing the advantage of a perturbation analysis of fluid flow. Using this, we develop a detailed analysis of the relationship between the fluid velocity and surface undulations, which is crucial for the subsequent numerical analysis of tracer motion. We used this information to study the dynamics of a tracer particle in the velocity field of an undulating microchannel. We show that the tracer particle can undergo ratcheting (which we call the hydrodynamics ratchet effect) in very specific, physically meaningful circumstances. We observe a ratcheting velocity of $\\sim 0.15 \\;\\mu$m/sec for a micrometre-sized particle at room temperature in water when the undulations wavelength is of the order of 1 $\\mu$m."

For a representative observable, we obtain an explicit expression and an asymptotic closed-form solution that naturally separate into a local contribution and a phase-space correlation term. These analytical results predict the band structure of the observable matrix, including its bandwidth and scaling behavior. We further demonstrate that our analytical formula is equivalent to the prediction of Berry's conjecture. Supported by numerical evidence, we show that Berry's conjecture captures the energetic long-wavelength behavior in the space of eigenstates, while our analytical solution describes the asymptotic behavior of the f function in the semiclassical limit. Finally, by revealing the connection between the bandwidth scaling and the underlying classical dynamics, our results suggest that the ETH carries important physical implications in single-particle and few-body systems, where \"thermalization\" manifests as the loss of information about initial conditions."

Their stability changes and bifurcations in general are thus of central interest. Here, coupled map lattice discretizations of nonlinear partial differential equations, exhibiting a variety of behaviors depending on the coupling strength, are considered. In particular, the linear stability analysis of synchronized states is performed by evaluating the Bravais lattice orbit Jacobian in its reciprocal space first Brillouin zone, with space and time treated on equal grounds. The eigenvalues of the orbit Jacobian operator, computed as functions of the coupling strength, tell us about the stability of the periodic orbit under a perturbation of a certain time- and space frequency. Moreover, the stability under aperiodic, that is, incoherent perturbations, is revealed by integrating the sum of the stability exponents over all space-time frequencies."

The basic reproduction number $\\mathcal R_0$ calculated from models that assume homogeneous mixing or single-layer contact structures have limited applicability to complex social systems. Here, we propose an expression of $\\mathcal R_0$ in the context of multiplex networks, enabling the analysis of disease transmission across multiple social layers. We adapt the Degree-Based Mean-Field (DBMF) SIR model for single-layered complex networks to the multiplex setting, where each layer has its own degree distribution and infection rate. Using the Next Generation Matrix method, we derive an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal R_0$. Numerical integration of the multiplex DBMF equations shows that $\\mathcal R_0 = 1$ marks the epidemic threshold and governs the functional dependence of key outbreak indicators. In addition to the exact result for the $\\mathcal R_0$, we provide an approximation denoted as $\\tau$, which is easier to compute and more straightforward to interpret in terms of the parameters of the system, and shares most of the expected properties of the basic reproduction number. Stochastic agent-based simulations confirm these results, demonstrating a direct correspondence between $\\tau$ and the average number of secondary infections in the early epidemic phase, in line with the interpretation of $\\mathcal R_0$. This research provides a robust generalization of $\\mathcal R_0$ for layered contact structures, offering a more realistic basis for epidemic forecasting and the design of intervention strategies."

As an application we study the non-unitary dynamics of a lossy or driven-dissipative BCS superconductors, evolving in presence of two-body losses and two-body pumps. We show that the non-Hermitian limit acts as a singular limit of the hybrid dissipative dynamics, leading to a sharp modification of the universal approach to the driven-dissipative steady-states. By considering the dissipative dynamics with pair losses, we show that, as the non-Hermitian limit is approached, the density dynamics sharply evolves from a universal power-law to exponential decay that converges towards a quasi-steady plateau characterized by the freezing of the particle depletion due to pair losses. The reached quasi-stationary density increases as a function of the dissipation rate highlighting the emergence of a non-Hermitian Zeno effect in the lossy dynamics. For the driven-dissipative case, we show that, in the non-Hermitian limit, the system gets trapped into an effective negative temperature state, thus skipping the infinite temperature steady-state reached in the presence of finite contribution of the quantum jumps. We rationalize these findings in terms of the conservation of the length of the pseudospins which, in the non-Hermitian limit, suppresses the effective single-particle losses and pumps acting on the non-condensed particles."

This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities."

Eventually, the metastable prethermal $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure breaks down via a proliferation of Gauss' law defects, similar to bubble formation in false vacuum decay. In this regime, we discover spatio-temporal correlations described by a non-linear surface growth consistent with the $(1+1)$D Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We benchmark our results in small systems against semi-classical discrete time Wigner approximation (DTWA) and exact diagonalization (ED), where the breakdown of DTWA signals the emergence of an extensive number of local symmetries that strongly influence the thermalization pathway. Our model provides a testbed for quantum simulators and is directly implementable in large-scale arrays of Rydberg atoms."

      "summary": "We investigate entanglement detection in quantum materials through criteria based on the simultaneous suppression of collective matter excitations. Unlike other detection schemes, these criteria can be applied to continuous and unbounded variables. By considering a system of interacting dipoles on a lattice, we show the detection of collective entanglement arising from two different physical mechanisms, namely, the ferroelectric ordering and the dressing of matter degrees of freedom by light. In the latter case, the detection shows the formation of a collective entangled phase not directly related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results open a new perspective for the entanglement characterization of competing orders in quantum materials, and have direct application to quantum paraelectrics with large polariton splittings."

      "summary": "The diffusionless Burgers-Bain phase transition from a hcp arrangement to a cuboidal lattice (fcc and bcc) is analysed in great detail for Lennard-Jones solids. From the lattice vectors of an underlying bi-lattice smoothly connecting these phases, we are able to express the corresponding lattice sums for inverse power potentials in terms of fast converging Bessel function expansions resulting in an efficient evaluation to computer accuracy for cohesive energies. From the kissing hard-sphere limit we derive exact analytical expressions for the lattice parameters varying along the minimum energy path of the phase transition. This simple model suggests that for the Burgers-Bain transformation of a LJ solid requires a minimum of four lattice parameters, $(a,\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma=c/a)$, describing the change in the base lattice lengths $a$ and $c$, the shear force acting on the hexagonal base plane ($\\alpha$), the sliding force of the middle layer of the original hexagonal packing arrangement($\\beta$), and the cuboidal transformation ($\\gamma=c/a$). This choice results in a two-step process: hcp$\\to$fcc$\\to$bcc. However, a further extension of the parameter space including an additional slide parameter for the middle layer, one suddenly observes a distinct symmetry-breaking effect along the hcp$\\rightarrow$fcc transition path with a bifurcation point appearing joining the original Burgers with the Bain path of the bcc$\\rightarrow$fcc cuboidal transition. Furthermore, for soft LJ potentials the bcc phase appears as a local minimum along the Burgers hcp$\\rightarrow$fcc path with two transition states to either the hcp or fcc phase. The underlying topology of the Burgers-Bain phase transition also incorporates the rhombohedral distortion of the bcc phase, which is analyzed in detail."

      "summary": "We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself."

We observe that the distribution is bi-exponential in nature. Near the boundary, the distribution exhibits rapid exponential decay, transitioning to a slower exponential decay, and eventually becoming uniform further away from the boundary. The length scales associated with the decay are found to depend on the confinement radius. We interpret these observations using molecular simulations and analytical calculations based on the Fokker-Planck equation for an Active Brownian Particle model. Our findings reveal that the small length scale is strongly influenced by the translational diffusion coefficient, while the larger length scale is governed by rotational diffusivity and self-propulsion. These results are explained in terms of two dimensionless parameters that explicitly include the confinement radius. The scaling behavior predicted analytically for the observed length scales is confirmed through simulations."

Here, we investigate the spin excitation spectra of the highly frustrated $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) Shastry-Sutherland model, focusing on the evolution of low-energy collective modes from the N\\'{e}el AFM phase to the plaquette valence bond solid (PVBS). We demonstrate that the AFM state exhibits altermagnetic behavior, characterized by a non-relativistic splitting between two chiral magnon bands. Furthermore, we identify two additional low-energy excitations: a Higgs mode in the longitudinal excitation channel and an $S=0$ excitation with vanishing spectral weight. As the system approaches the AFM-to-PVBS transition, both these modes soften along with the lowest-energy triplet and singlet modes in the PVBS state. The closing gap of the Higgs mode, combined with the nearly degenerate velocities of $S=1$ and $S=0$ excitations, provides spectral evidence that the AFM-to-PVBS transition is proximate to a DQCP with emergent $O(4)$ symmetry. Our results help clarify the spectral signature of a broad class of symmetry enhanced quantum phase transitions including deconfined quantum criticality."

MPRHS fluid-to-solid phase transitions are well established, as is prediction of the coexistence region via thermodynamic theory. Consensus holds that the MPRHS coexistence region is metastable, where nucleation governs crystallization. Our review explores the abundant physics and rheology literature for MPRHS, revealing two related observations: We find clear mechanistic explanation for crystallization of MPRHS, and that producing spontaneous MPRHS coexistence in simulations is notoriously difficult. Frenkel's mechanism-that vibrational entropy gains offset configurational entropy losses to drive MPRHS phase transition-suggests system size is the fundamental simulation issue. Alder and Wainwright recognized this constraint and emphasized the merit of direct observation in simulations, of explicitly following an isotherm through the coexistence region. But with 1M particles, estimated nucleation time is 317M years. Recent large-scale simulations reinforce this, showing phase transition, but not reporting explicit phase separation. The ideal condition is a tractably-large system and minimal perturbation to exit metastability. Instead, brute force is often used to trigger nucleation and phase separation via seeding, pre-construction, or gravity. Some simulations do show brief spontaneous coexistence but a metastable crystal or fluid subsequently overtakes the system. Putatively-hard WCA potentials allow extra free volume, lowering osmotic pressure and the energy barrier, and avoiding the strict short/long-range entropy challenge. Overall, rheological and computational demonstration of Frenkel's mechanism for MPRHS remains elusive, awaiting sufficiently large systems of sufficiently hard MPRHS."

However, a systematic mathematical framework for measuring or estimating the temperature is still underdeveloped. Here, we incorporate the estimation theory in statistical inference to estimate the temperature of a finite-sized system and propose optimal estimation based on the uniform minimum variance unbiased estimation. Treating the finite-sized system as a thermometer measuring the temperature of a heat reservoir, we demonstrate that different optimal estimation of parameters yield different formulas of entropy, e.g., optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) aligns with the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). The optimal estimation leads to a achievable energy-temperature uncertainty relation and exhibits sample-size dependence, coinciding with their counterparts in nanothermodynamics. The achievable bound and the non-Gaussian distribution of temperature enable experimental testing in finite-sized systems."

In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions.

In this work, we propose exactly-solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models that simultaneously host three-state-coexisting quantum phases, with their phase boundaries analytically derived via Avila's global theorem. Furthermore, we propose experimental protocols via Rydberg atom arrays to realize these states. Notably, we demonstrate a spectroscopic technique capable of measuring inverse participation ratios across real-space and dual-space domains, enabling simultaneous characterization of localized, extended, and multifractal quantum phases in systems with up to tens of qubits. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems."

In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures."

We find that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+ig$ symmetries are the leading candidates for the quasi-2D orbital, while a chiral $p$-wave state in the quasi-1D orbitals is essential for generating an accessible Kerr angle. The Lifshitz transition is shown to affect coherence factors and density-of-states peaks, producing sharp signatures in $T_c$ and optical transport. Inter-orbital charge transfer further enhances these effects by modifying the balance between quasi-1D and quasi-2D contributions. These results provide a framework for interpreting Kerr effect experiments in multi-orbital superconductors."

We analyze the statistical properties of tunneling conductance maps of increasingly localized states as we approach the edge of the valence band. Using multifractal analysis, we show that the system follows an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NLsMs). We anticipate that this symmetry may be broken in specific - e.g. chiral electronic phases.

This approach to probing ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics.

Surprisingly, we found that introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier into N-polar AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures induces a transition in these heterostructures from PPC to negativie photoconductivity (NPC) as the SL period number increased at room temperature. This transition occurred under an infrared light illumination and can be well explained in terms of the excitation of hot electrons from the two-dimensional electron gas and subsequent trapping them in a SL structure. The NPC effect observed in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with SL back barrier exhibits photoconductivity yield exceeding 85 % and thus is the largest ones reported so far for semiconductors. In addition, NPC signal remains relatively stable at high temperatures up to 400 K. The obtained results can be interesting for the development of NPC related devices such as photoelectric logic gates, photoelectronic memory and infrared photodetectors."

      "summary": "Short abstract: The paper reviews the physics of Fr\\\"ohlich excitonic polarons from the viewpoint of empirical approaches with some original developments. Models for excitonic polarons in ionic semiconductors in the spirit of the Lee Low and Pines (LLP) model for free polarons were initiated by Toyozawa and Hermanson and extended by Pollman and Buttner (PB). The dominant electron-hole interaction with the lattice introduced by Frohlich is represented by a long-range effective interaction with a single longitudinal optical polar mode. The properties of the excitonic polarons are characterized by various physical quantities such as effective dielectric constants, effective masses, virtual phonon populations, carrier self-energies and binding energies, and effective electron-hole interactions mediated by the lattice. In 3D perovskites, the excitonic polarons deviate from the simplified picture of weakly interacting (almost free) polarons, with sizeable effects of electron-hole correlations on all the physical properties."

      "summary": "The topological properties of a material depend on its symmetries, parameters, and spatial dimension. Changes in these properties due to parameter and symmetry variations can be understood by computing the corresponding topological invariant. Since topological invariants are typically defined for a fixed spatial dimension, there is no existing framework to understand the effects of changing spatial dimensions via invariants. Here, we introduce a framework to study topological phase transitions as a system's dimensionality is altered using real-space topological markers. Specifically, we consider Shiba lattices, which are class D materials formed by magnetic atoms on the surface of a conventional superconductor, and characterize the evolution of their topology when an initial circular island is deformed into a chain. We also provide a measure of the corresponding protection against disorder. Our framework is generalizable to any symmetry class and spatial dimension, potentially guiding the design of materials by identifying, for example, the minimum thickness of a slab required to maintain three-dimensional topological properties."

This work presents a robust implicit solvent method for simulating non-colloidal suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions. Our approach is based on a regularized boundary integral formulation, enabling accurate and efficient computation of hydrodynamic interactions. This makes the method well-suited for large-scale simulations. We validate the method by comparing computed drag forces on homogeneous and Janus particles with analytical results. Additionally, we consider the effective viscosity of suspensions with varying slip lengths, benchmarking against available analytical no-slip and partial-slip theories."

Here, we combine surface-confined synthesis with scanning tunneling microscopy(STM)tip-induced dehydrogenation to achieve atom-precise engineering of quasi-one-dimensional porphyrin-based Kondo chains (1-7 units) on Au(111). High-resolution STS measurements and low-energy effective modeling collectively demonstrate that {\\pi}-radicals at each fused-porphyrin unit form Kondo singlets screened by conduction electrons. Adjacent singlets develop direct coherent coupling via quantum-state-overlap-enabled electron tunneling. Crucially, chiral symmetry in the effective model governs zero-mode distribution-present in odd-length chains yet absent in even-length chains-which dictates pronounced odd-even quantum effects in STS spectra of finite chains. Furthermore, the number of parallel porphyrin chains non-monotonically tunes the competition between the Kondo effect and spin exchange, showing opposing trends in strength and demonstrating that both wave-function overlap and the SOMO-LUMO gap collectively govern these interactions. This work simultaneously resolves the dimensional dependence of many-body correlations in confined quantum systems and pioneers approaches for quantum-critical manipulation in molecular spin architectures."

Using the recently developed first-principles scGD0 method, we calculate spectral functions with nonperturbative effects such as broadening, satellites, and energy-dependent renormalization. We show that the scGD0 spectral functions outperform one-shot G0D0 and cumulant approximations in model Hamiltonians and real materials, eliminating unphysical spectral kinks and correctly predicting the phonon emission continuum. Building on this, we introduce the self-consistent ladder formalism for transport, which captures vertex corrections due to electron-phonon interactions. This approach unifies and improves upon the two state-of-the-art approaches for first-principles phonon-limited transport: the bubble approximation and the Boltzmann transport equation. Moreover, as a charge-conserving approximation, it enables consistent calculations of the optical conductivity and dielectric function. We validate the developed method against numerically exact results for model Hamiltonians in the dilute polaronic limit and apply it to real materials. Our results show quantitative agreement with the experimental dc conductivities in intrinsic semiconductors Si and ZnO and the SrVO3 metal, as well as excellent agreement with the experimental THz optical and dielectric properties of Si and ZnO. This work unifies first-principles and many-body approaches for studying transport, opening new directions for applying many-body theory to materials with strong electron-phonon interactions."

In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials."

      "summary": "Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing key phenomena, such as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions present in the system. In three-dimensional materials, it typically comprises an intraband contribution, dependent on the chemical potential, and an interband contribution, largely independent of it. In this study, within the random phase approximation framework, we uncover a novel interband contribution that, unlike the conventional case, exhibits an explicit dependence on the chemical potential, which has no counterpart in two dimensions. In the long-wavelength limit, this term introduces a resonance feature with cubic wave-vector dependence when the chemical potential approaches the band edge, in contrast to the quadratic behavior characteristic of standard intraband and interband processes. Focusing on three-dimensional Dirac nodal line semimetals, we show that the polarizability is intraband-dominated at low frequencies, while interband processes prevail at intermediate and high frequencies, with the overall response being tunable via the chemical potential. Material-specific estimates for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and ZrSiS reveal a strong tunability of both contributions. These findings open new directions for probing frequency-dependent dielectric properties and hold promise for applications in tunable plasmonic and optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth."

      "summary": "Enskog-Vlasov equation is currently the most sophisticated kinetic model for describing non-equilibrium evaporative flows. While it enables more efficient simulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in reproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by both the assumptions underlying the Vlasov forcing term and the approximation introduced by the Enskog collision term for short-range molecular interactions. To address this limitation, this work proposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with the Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate the equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the liquid-vapour coexistence curve, transport coefficients, vapour pressure, and surface tension coefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate non-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity distribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The results confirm that deviations from the Maxwellian distribution persist in the vapour region, indicating limitations of the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation under pronounced non-equilibrium conditions. This work represents a critical step towards the development of an accurate and efficient computational framework for modelling non-equilibrium liquid-vapour flows for real fluids, with direct relevance to practical applications such as flow cooling."

However, the thermodynamic metastability of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and oxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing phase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates using gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under an ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further post annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting film exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical factors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of Ln3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control suppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer coverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking faults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a single superconducting transition and high Tc,onset. These findings provide valuable insights for the layer-by-layer epitaxy growth of diverse oxide high-temperature superconducting films."

In-situ x-ray photoemission spectroscopy shows core level shifts that are consistently related to electron transfer from the n-GaN(0001) to the 2H-TaS$_2$ epitaxial layer as well as the formation of a high concentration of nitrogen vacancies close to the interface.

This result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry.

However, antiferromagnetic domains are notoriously challenging to image in real-space. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) offers a route to overcome this difficulty: XMCD contrast may be finite in TRS-breaking antiferromagnets with an appropriate magnetic space group. Here, we exploit this to image the octupole domains in a focused ion beam-fabricated device of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn. Using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy, we spatially resolve the weak pre-edge XMCD contrast (of 0.2%) that is sensitive to $T_z$, achieving a contrast resolution better than 0.02%. We observe hysteretic switching of the octupole order through both the XMCD contrast and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect within the same device. These results confirm the bulk nature of this contrast, and establish XMCD-based microscopy as a powerful real space imaging method for TRS-breaking antiferromagnets, including altermagnets, enabling future studies of their dynamics, switching, and symmetry-tunable phenomena."

      "summary": "We provide a quantum mechanical description of phonon amplification in a heterostructure consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) stacked on top of a piezoelectric material. An applied drift voltage effectively creates a population inversion in the momentum states of the 2DEG electrons, giving rise to spontaneous emission of phonons. Once an acoustic wave is launched, the pumped electrons release phonons via stimulated emission, returning to depleted ground states before being pumped back to the excited states. We show that whereas efficient amplification using a 1D electron gas requires the acoustic wavelength to roughly equal the average electron-electron spacing, a 2DEG enables efficient amplification for any wavelength greater than the average electron-electron spacing. We derive the imaginary and real parts of the 2DEG first-order acoustic susceptibility as functions of electronic drift velocity in specific limits and derive the gain per unit length for the signal and the quantum noise, with the gain matching the classical result in the short-electronic-lifetime (low-mobility) regime. Moreover, we analyze the gain clamping due to pump depletion and calculate the maximum achievable intensity. Our results provide a framework for designing novel acoustic devices including a quantum phononic laser and phase-insensitive quantum phononic amplifiers."

      "summary": "The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices."

In this work, we construct the first efficiently implementable and exactly detailed-balanced Lindbladian for Gibbs states of arbitrary noncommutative Hamiltonians. Our construction can also be regarded as a continuous-time quantum analog of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To prepare the quantum Gibbs state, our algorithm invokes Hamiltonian simulation for a time proportional to the mixing time and the inverse temperature $\\beta$, up to polylogarithmic factors. Moreover, the gate complexity reduces significantly for lattice Hamiltonians as the corresponding Lindblad operators are (quasi-) local (with radius $\\sim\\beta$) and only depend on local Hamiltonian patches. Meanwhile, purifying our Lindbladians yields a temperature-dependent family of frustration-free \"parent Hamiltonians\", prescribing an adiabatic path for the canonical purified Gibbs state (i.e., the Thermal Field Double state). These favorable features suggest that our construction serves as a quantum algorithmic counterpart to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling."

Due to its unquenchable nature, measurements by static compression techniques on physical properties of davemaoite at lower mantle conditions are rare and technically challenging, and those are essential to constrain compositions and properties of mineralogical models in the lower mantle. Here, we present Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa. We propose that the melting temperature of davemaoite should be higher than those reported theoretically by now."

To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonthermal states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the \"crosscap quench\", to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems."

Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of qutrits useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate microwave pulse gates to a low error rate to operate transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki), which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena, such as topologically protected ground states, string order, and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. To establish the advantage of qutrits over qubits in the presence of noise, we present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase using tensor network simulations. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter."

We couple suitable resonant laser beams to a gas of ultracold atoms, thereby inducing artificial SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields that act on a degenerate ground state manifold comprised of three dark states. We demonstrate the inherent all-state connectivity of SU(3) systems by performing targeted geometric transformations. Then, we investigate color-orbit coupling, an extension of SU(2) spin-orbit coupling to SU(3) systems. We reveal a rich dynamical interplay between three distinct oscillation frequencies, which possesses interesting analogies with neutrino oscillations and quark mixing mechanisms.

We present here a Python library for simulating the NV spin dynamics under general experimental conditions, i.e. a digital twin. Our library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time evolution, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum observable given by fluorescence. The simulation framework is based on a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, where the states initialization and readout are postulated from the interaction with optical fields. By eliminating oversimplifications such as the adoption of rotating frames for the microwave and radio frequency fields, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics emerging from realistic pulse constraints. The software is illustrated with three examples and validated by comparing the simulations with experimental reports, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (conditional logic gates), sensing (dynamical decoupling sequences with coupled spins) and networks (state teleportation). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, which can be used for a wide range of applications."

One such problem involves a swarm collectively producing a desired (target) density through local sensing, motion, and interactions in a domain. Here, we take a statistical physics perspective and develop and analyze a model wherein agents move in a stochastic walk over a networked domain, so as to reduce the error between the swarm density and the target, based on local, random, and uncertain measurements of the current density by the swarming agents. Using a combination of mean-field, small-fluctuation, and finite-number analysis, we are able to quantify how close and how fast a swarm comes to producing a target as a function of sensing uncertainty, stochastic collision rates, numbers of agents, and spatial variation of the target."

In this work, we develop a statistical physics framework to explain this emergent fairness by modeling individual consumption as stochastic variables drawn from a realistic distribution, specifically the gamma distribution. Introducing a Boltzmann-like weighting factor, we derive exact analytical expressions for the partition function, average consumption, variance, and entropy under economic or social penalization constraints. Numerical simulations, performed using the Marsaglia-Tsang algorithm, confirm the analytical results with high precision. Drawing a direct parallel between individual consumption and ideal gas particle energy in the canonical ensemble, we show how the law of large numbers, mutual compensation, and the effective ordering induced by penalization combine to make equal cost-sharing statistically robust and predictable. These findings reveal that what appears to be an informal social convention is, in fact, grounded in the same fundamental principles that govern the collective behavior of particles in thermodynamic systems, highlighting the interdisciplinary power of statistical physics."

The electrons form the qubits of the system, and the purity of the noble gas surface protects the relevant quantum properties of each electron. Previous work has indicated that manipulation of a confining double-well potential for electrons on superfluid helium can generate entanglement suitable for two-qubit gate operations. In this work, we incorporate a time-dependent tuning of the potential shape to further explore operation of two-qubit gates with the superfluid helium system. Through numerical time evolution, we show that fast, high-fidelity two-qubit gates can be achieved. In particular, we simulate operation of the $\\sqrt{i\\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and CZ gates and obtain fidelities of 0.999 and 0.996 with execution times of 2.9 ns and 9.4 ns, respectively. Furthermore, we examine the stability of these gate fidelities under non-ideal execution conditions, which reveals new properties to consider in the device design.

However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation."

The authors not only establish a theoretical framework for the transition but also provide practical approaches utilizing the AFMs achievements for 100 years to obtain AMs, significantly expanding the scope of AM materials for both theoretical studies and future practical applications.

In micrometer-scale devices made from the stack, they demonstrate the stability of approximately 30 synaptic states for up to 1200 seconds, with some states stable for up to 50,000 seconds.
