      "summary": "This dissertation presents a systematic theoretical investigation into realizing a condensed matter analogue of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in a quasi-planar, 2+1D system. The research establishes a conceptual bridge between the anomalous transport phenomena of high-energy physics and the emergent electronic properties of engineered honeycomb lattices. The central objective is the formulation of a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the necessary ingredients for a CME-like effect. This is achieved by moving beyond pristine graphene, whose inherent sublattice symmetry precludes the formation of a mass gap necessary for defining robust pseudo-chiral states. The core of this work is a model based on a honeycomb lattice with explicitly broken sublattice symmetry, which introduces a band gap and endows the quasi-particles system with a well-defined pseudo-chirality based on sublattice polarization. A time-reversal symmetry-breaking parameter is introduced to asymmetrically modify the valley gaps, creating a controllable non-equilibrium imbalance analogous to the chiral chemical potential in relativistic systems. A key finding is the validation of the physical model consistency; through commutator calculations, the total angular momentum - comprising both orbital and an emergent lattice spin component - is shown to be a conserved quantity. This research successfully transforms the abstract possibility of a 2D CME into a concrete, self-consistent theoretical framework, detailing the precise symmetry conditions required for its manifestation."

      "summary": "Simple mechanical models of DNA play an important role in studying the dynamics of its open states. The main requirement when developing a DNA model is the correct selection of its effective potentials and parameters based on experimental data. At the same time, various experiments allow us to \"see\" different types of DNA open states. Consideration of this feature is one of the most important conditions in the development, optimization, and parameterization of any mechanical model. Violation of this condition, i.e., the comparison of incomparable characteristics, leads to critical errors. The present investigation is devoted to the problem of degrees of freedom of DNA bases taken into account in mechanical models. Using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model as an example, two types of errors in interpreting experimental data when compared with the model are examined. The first one is a mismatch between the open state types in the model and experiment. The second one is an incorrect specification of the \"threshold coordinate\" of the open state. The concept of the effective total threshold coordinate of the radial separation of DNA strands for registration of opening is introduced. It is shown that correct interpretation of experimental data can actually eliminate discrepancies with theory."

      "summary": "We investigate the representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals. Crystal symmetries are usually described as the finite symmetry group of a finite crystal with periodic boundary conditions, for which the Brillouin zone is a finite set of points. However, to deal with the continuous crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ required to discuss the continuity, singularity or analyticity of band energies $\\epsilon_n(\\mathbf{k})$ and Bloch states $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}$, we need to consider infinite crystals. The symmetry groups of infinite crystals belong to the category of infinite non-compact groups, for which many standard tools of group theory break down. For example, character theory is no longer available for these groups and we use harmonic analysis to build the group algebra, the regular representation, the induction of irreducible representations of the crystallographic group from projective representations of the point groups and the decomposition of a representation into its irreducible parts. We deal with magnetic and non-magnetic groups in arbitrary dimensions. In the last part of the paper, we discuss Mackey's restriction of an induced representation to a subgroup, the tensor product of induced representations and the symmetric and antisymmetric squares of induced representations."

Toward pursuing this aim for diopside (MgCaSi2O6), the merit of different sol-gel and coprecipitation processes using the related chloride precursors followed by calcination was compared from the viewpoints of crystallinity and homogeneity. In accordance to the results, the use of the sol-gel techniques, directed with/without an alkaline catalyst, gave rise to the unfavorable creation of multiphase and low-crystallinity structures. Regarding the coprecipitation methods, the one-step addition of a precipitant agent is accompanied by an indirect low-temperature formation of nano-diopside, while a direct crystallization into this phase was explored in the dropwise condition, albeit with a lower crystallinity. Thus, by employing a suitable synthesis processing, it is feasible to take control of a wide range of nanoparticulate diopside-based structures achieved after a low-temperature calcination."

      "summary": "This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies."

      "summary": "In order to further investigate the magnetic state of the RAgAl series, the magnetization measurements on the TbAgAl compound from this series have been extended to higher fields of 12 Tesla in the temperature range 2K-300K. The electrical resistivity in the temperature range 2-300K has been measured up to fields of 9 Tesla. The field dependence of magnetization at low temperatures suggests an antiferromagnetic state undergoing a metamagnetic transition to a ferromagnetic state above the critical field. The observation of large coercivity (unlike other compounds in the RAgAl series) and non-saturation of magnetization indicates a disordered magnetic state having both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. The presence of competing interactions leading to a disordered state is also supported by transport measurements and is attributed presumably to the layered structure of the compound."

      "summary": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) exhibit remarkable photovoltaic performance, where interface engineering with hole transport layers (HTLs) is crucial for optimizing charge transfer and device efficiency. In this work, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the MAPbI3/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid interface, focusing on the role of perovskite surface termination in determining interfacial stability and electronic structure. We model MAI- and PbI-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces interfaced with P3HT and compare their interfacial electronic properties. Electronic structure calculations reveal distinct differences in orbital hybridization and band alignment: the MAI/m-P3HT interface exhibits weak coupling, whereas the PbI/m-P3HT interface shows stronger hybridization and enhanced charge transfer. Band alignment confirms type-II, hole-selective character in both cases, with more pronounced valence band maximum adjustment for PbI. Charge difference maps, Bader analysis, and local density of states consistently indicate higher charge transfer and stronger electronic coupling for PbI termination. Electrostatic potential offsets and transport parameters further highlight termination-dependent differences, with lighter effective masses at PbI/m-P3HT and higher hole velocity at MAI/m-P3HT. These findings provide theoretical insight into interfacial charge transport mechanisms and offer guidelines for optimizing perovskite-organic hybrid solar cells."

      "summary": "Twisted multilayer moir\\'e materials are generically quasiperiodic on the moir\\'e scale due to the interference of different misaligned moir\\'e periodicities. Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures."

      "summary": "The coherence of quantum dot qubits fabricated in semiconductors is often limited by charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics, which are material- and process-dependent. Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits."

      "summary": "Understanding the magnetic ground state of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates is crucial, as these materials exhibit superconductivity under high pressure and host competing electronic orders that may play a key role in the pairing mechanism. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\\mu$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \\simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $\\Delta T_{SDW} \\simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \\simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds."

We apply this approach to a family of structurally similar yet electronically distinct hexagonal materials-MgB2, graphene, and hBN-to analyze how a single phonon mode simultaneously modifies the electronic structure (band dispersion) and the nature of chemical bonding (natural occupations and nodal patterns) in real space. Our results show that band splitting becomes physically relevant only when it is accompanied by an electronic redistribution, reflected in changes of the occupation numbers or bonding topology. Thus, SSAdNDP provides a direct bridge between reciprocal- and real-space representations, translating phenomena such as electron-phonon coupling into chemically intuitive reorganizations of multicenter bonds, and offering a unified framework to interpret vibrationally driven electronic effects in solids."

A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution < 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal.

This computation was previously inaccessible using the traditional three-phase direct coexistence technique. To achieve this, we employ a novel solubility-based method, which allows us to accurately evaluate the coexistence line. Finally, we have determined the upper quadruple point (Q2) where the four phases, namely hydrate, liquid water, liquid CO2, and vapor, coexist.

      "summary": "Superionic conduction in solid-state materials is governed not only by static factors, such as structure and composition, but also by dynamic interactions between the mobile ion and the crystal lattice. Specifically, the dynamics of lattice vibrations, or phonons, have attracted interest because of their hypothesized ability to facilitate superionic conduction. However, direct experimental measurement of the role of phonons in ionic conduction is challenging due to the fast intrinsic timescales of ion hopping and the difficulty of driving relevant phonon modes, which often lie in the low-energy THz regime. To overcome these limitations, we use laser-driven ultrafast impedance spectroscopy (LUIS). LUIS resonantly excites phonons using a THz field and probes ion hopping with picosecond time resolution. We apply LUIS to understand the dynamical role of phonons in $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ (LLZO). When in its cubic phase (c-LLZO), this garnet-type solid electrolyte has an ionic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than its tetragonal phase (t-LLZO). T-LLZO is characterized by an ordered and filled $Li^+$ sublattice necessitating synchronous ion hopping. In contrast, c-LLZO is characterized by a disordered and vacancy-rich $Li^+$ sublattice, and has a conduction mechanism dominated by single hops. We find that, upon excitation of phonons in the 0.5-7.5 THz range, the impedance of t-LLZO experiences a longer ion hopping decay signal in comparison to c-LLZO. The results suggest that phonon-mediated ionic conduction by THz modes may lead to larger ion displacements in ordered and fully occupied mobile ion sublattices as opposed to those that are disordered and vacancy-rich. Overall, this work highlights the interplay between static and dynamic factors that enables improved ionic conductivity in otherwise poorly conducting inorganic solids."

In this work, using CaPd5 as the prototype structure, we discover and systematically investigate a new class of kagome superconductors, CaMxPd5-x (M = Nb and V) alloys. First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3. CaNb5 is identified as a strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) superconductor with the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 10.1 K, which can be further increased to 12.8 K under external pressure. In contrast, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 exhibit weaker EPC and correspondingly lower Tc values. Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5 provides an effective route for designing a new type of kagome superconductor with relatively high Tc. This study also offers new perspectives on topological superconductivity in kagome systems and establishes a useful guideline for discovering other superconducting materials with unique properties."

However, meeting all of these requirements simultaneously has been difficult with conventional high-k systems. In this work, we demonstrate that Hf/Zr-based gate stacks quantitatively satisfy these conditions. After a 700 C N2 anneal, the HZH superlattice achieves an EOT of 7.3 A, lower than conventional HfO2-only stacks (8.5 A) while maintaining comparable leakage. Embedding a 3 A Al2O3 dipole within an HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2 superlattice (HZHA) breaks the conventional dipole trade-off, achieving an EOT of 8.4 A, lower than the 9.0 A of a standard HfO2/Al2O3 stack, while providing a flatband voltage shift greater than 200 mV, thereby enabling multi-Vth tuning without compromising scaling. Furthermore, under -2 V negative-bias temperature stress at 125 C for 100 s, HZHA and HA exhibit comparable flatband voltage drifts of 87 mV and 97 mV, respectively, confirming that strong Vth tunability and sub-nanometer EOT can be achieved without compromising stability. In addition to these quantitative advances, this study reveals previously unreported physical insights into dipole behavior and interfacial diffusion in ultrathin Hf/Zr multilayers. These results establish HZHA as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier."

By leveraging the chemical sensitivity of AES to subtle changes in valence electron populations, we show that this technique can distinguish distinct oxidation states in multivalent perovskite manganate and vanadate systems with high fidelity during deposition. Furthermore, we show evidence for dynamic chemical phenomena, specifically charge transfer processes at the polar-nonpolar LaMnO3/SrTiO3 interface. Our results establish in situ AES as a powerful diagnostic tool for monitoring and controlling interfacial chemistry during thin film growth, offering a pathway toward the atomic-scale engineering of chemical states in functional oxide heterostructures."

      "summary": "Strong Coulomb interactions in low-dimensional quantum materials give rise to emergent bound states such as excitons and trions, which play a central role in correlated electronic phases. In quasi-one-dimensional systems, equilibrium photoemission studies have reported signatures of trions, suggesting an unusually robust state, as opposed to conventional semiconductors where trions typically appear only as excited states stabilized by carrier doping. Here, we show that optical excitation of undoped Ta2NiS5 - a correlated quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor - generates a pronounced and long-lived trion population, demonstrating that such states can be dynamically induced even in the absence of doping. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we track the dynamics of a bright, localized in-gap state that emerges following photoexcitation and identify it as a transient trion population. We uncover an unconventional trion formation pathway and a fluence-dependent competition between trions and excitons. These findings extend ultrafast quasiparticle photoemission spectroscopy to complex bound states in bulk quantum materials, enabling the dynamical control of charged and neutral excitations."

      "summary": "Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for studying how both the Kondo effect and quantum fluctuations compete with the magnetic exchange interactions that drive magnetic ordering. Here, we investigate the effect of tuning the heavy-fermion compound CePdIn, which crystallizes in the geometrically frustrated ZrNiAl-type structure, using applied magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. At ambient pressure, CePdIn exhibits two magnetic transitions, one at $T_{\\rm{N}} \\approx 1.65$ K and another at $T_{\\rm{M}} \\approx 1.15$ K, which are both suppressed by applied $c$-axis fields. Upon applying pressure in zero magnetic field, there is a non-monotonic evolution of $T_{\\rm{N}}$, which decreases to 0.8 K at 2.3 GPa, before abruptly increasing to 1.5 K at 2.6 GPa. At higher pressures, $T_{\\rm{N}}$ has a weak pressure dependence, and vanishes near 5 GPa. Together with the high-pressure phase being more robust to applied fields, these results suggest two distinct antiferromagnetic phases in CePdIn, which are separated near 2.6 GPa, and this change may be driven by the evolution of the underlying electronic structure due to enhanced Kondo hybridization under pressure."

      "summary": "We present a systematic study of temperature-driven nonaffine rearrangements in a model amorphous solid across the full thermodynamic range, from a high-temperature liquid, through supercooled and sub-glass regimes, into deep glassy states. The central result is a quantitative characterisation of the componentwise nonaffine residual displacements, obtained by subtracting local affine maps from particle displacements. For each state point the tails of the probability distributions of these nonaffine components display clear exponential decay; linear fits to the logarithm of the tail region yield characteristic nonaffine length scales {\\xi}NA,x and {\\xi}NA,y , which quantify the spatial extent of purely nonaffine, local rearrangements. To compare with other length scales, we compute van Hove distributions Gx(ux), Gy (uy ) which capture the full particle displacement field (coherent affine-like motion plus residuals). A robust, key finding is that the van Hove length scale consistently exceeds the filtered nonaffine length scale, i.e. {\\xi}VH > {\\xi}NA, across all temperatures, state points, and densities we studied. The nonaffine length {\\xi}NA quantifies the distance over which complex deformation occurs, specifically nonlinear and anharmonic responses, irreversible (plastic) rearrangements, topological non-recoverable particle rearrangements, and other residual motions that cannot be represented by a local affine map. Moreover, near equality of {\\xi}NA,x and {\\xi}NA,y in all conditions provides further evidence that nonaffine rearrangements propagate isotropically under thermally driven deformation in contrast to externally driven shear."

To provide new insight, we investigate the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid in the very-low temperature regime, by using a replicated version of the refined HMSA theory of the liquid state, combined with an appropriate split of the pair potential [Bomont and Bretonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4141 (2001)]. Our scheme allows one to reach an unprecedented low-temperature domain within both the supercooled liquid and the ideal-glass phase. Therein, a density-dependent temperature is identified, whereupon the radial distribution function experiences clear-cut structural changes, insofar as an additional peak develops in between the main and the second peaks. Such a structural feature points to a local structure of the Lennard-Jones ideal glass with an fcc-like short-range order, in the absence of any long-range order."

Here, we establish a thermodynamically exact stability phase diagram for generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics on sparse random graphs, resolving how finite connectivity and interaction heterogeneity jointly govern ecosystem resilience. Using a small-coupling expansion of the dynamic cavity method, we derive an effective single-site stochastic process that is solvable via population dynamics. Our approach uncovers a topological phase transition--driven purely by the finite connectivity structure of the network--that leads to multi-stability. This instability is fundamentally distinct from the disorder-driven transitions induced by quenched randomness of the couplings. Our framework overcomes the considerable computational cost of direct simulations, offering a scalable and versatile analysis of stability, biodiversity, and alternative stable states in realistic, large-scale ecological ecosystems."

Here we propose and analyze an alternative route to a fast $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for two fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice based on optimized, time-dependent control of the short and long lattice depths. The gate is implemented by transiently releasing the atoms into a quasi-harmonic confinement centered between the two sites. With an appropriately chosen contact interaction strength, a controlled collision accumulates the exchange phase required for $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and generates entanglement. We employ a continuum, time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger-equation simulation that goes beyond a two-site Fermi--Hubbard description and benchmark it against experimentally implemented tunneling-based protocols, reproducing the observed single-particle tunneling and spin-exchange dynamics. For experimentally accessible lattice depths, we find that the proposed gate operates in $\\sim 21\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, more than an order of magnitude faster than tunneling-based implementations, while achieving fidelities $\\gtrsim 99\\%$. We further analyze sensitivity to lattice-depth variations and show that a composite sequence improves robustness. Our results establish fast, collision-mediated entangling gates in superlattices as a promising building block for scalable neutral-atom quantum computation."

The properties considered in this work are: densities, structural properties, transport properties, surface tension, freezing point depression and maximum in density. All the developed models were able to describe quite well the experimental values of the densities. Structural properties were well described by models with charges equal or larger than 0.85, surface tension by the charge 0.92, maximum in density by the charge 0.85 and transport properties by the charge 0.75. The use of a scaled charge of 0.75 is able to reproduce with high accuracy the viscosities and diffusion coefficients of NaCl solutions by the first time. We have also considered the case of KCl in water and the results obtained were fully consistent with those of NaCl. There is no value of the scaled charge able to reproduce all the properties considered in this work. Although certainly scaled charges are not the final word in the development of force fields for electrolytes in water its use may have some practical advantages. Certain values of the scaled charge could be the best option when the interest is to describe certain experimental properties."

The models reproduce experimental descriptors (H/C, O/C, aromaticity, true density, and surface functionality) of their experimental counterparts, and simulations enable calculation of adsorption isotherms that align with available experimental measurements. Our results reveal that 2,4-D$^{-}$ uptake is governed by a synergy of three interaction classes: (i) ${\\pi}$-${\\pi}$ and ${\\pi}$-Cl contacts with graphitic domains with either parallel or perpendicular alignments, (ii) polar interactions including H-bonding to surface -OH and other oxygen-containing groups, and (iii) Na$^{+}$-mediated cation bridging that links 2,4-D$^{-}$ anion to surface oxygens, that would have an increasing relevance for biochars near or above the pH at point of zero charge. Notably, we found that low-temperature produced biochars, which retain higher densities of surface O functionalities, exhibit higher adsorption per unit surface area due to cooperative polar interactions alongside ${\\pi}$-${\\pi}$ binding, whereas medium-to-high temperature biochars rely more on ${\\pi}$-${\\pi}$ and cation-bridging mechanisms. The distinct adsorption distances measured emphasize surface heterogeneity and porosity. Taken together, these atomistic insights corroborate experimental observations and yield actionable guidance for the rational design of biochars for remediation of anionic herbicides, highlighting how surface functionality and solution chemistry can be tuned to optimize sorption. Our approach provides a general framework to interrogate pollutant-biochar interactions and to inform remediation strategies."

We find that the significantly stronger degree of correlation of the Cr-based materials compared to Ti and V can only be explained through the synergy of two effects: the larger electron filling of the $d$-shell and the reduced characteristic kinetic energy. We put forward that the substitution of Sb with Bi strengthens correlations in all compounds and make the prediction that the-yet-to-be-synthesized CsCr$_3$Bi$_5$ must be the most strongly correlated member of the entire family. These findings provide a quantitative, band-structure-based framework for understanding and predicting correlation strength in Kagome metals."

In both cases, the molecules of water and H$_2$ are modeled using the TIP4P/Ice and a modified version of the Silvera and Goldman models respectively, and the Berthelot combining rule for the cross water-H$_2$ interactions has been modified. The first method used in this work is the solubility method which consists in determining the solubility of H$_2$ in an aqueous phase when in contact with a H$_2$ hydrate (H--L$_{\\text{w}}$) phase and when in contact with a pure H$_2$ phase (L$_{\\text{w}}$--L$_{\\text{H}_2}$) at different temperatures. At a given pressure value, both solubility curves intersect at the temperature ($T_3$) at which the three phases coexist in equilibrium. Following this approach, we determine the dissociation temperature of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\\,\\text{MPa}$ finding a good agreement with the data previously reported in the literature. We also analyze the effect of the multiple occupancy of the D, or small, and H, or large, cages of the sII hydrate structure. We conclude that the $T_3$ value is barely affected by the occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\\,\\text{MPa}$. From the analysis of the solubility curves and performing extra bulk simulations of the three phases involved in the equilibrium, we also determine the driving force for nucleation ($\\Delta\\mu^{\\text{EC}}_{N}$) at $185\\,\\text{MPa}$ as a function of the supercooling degree and the H$_2$ hydrate occupancy. We determine that, thermodynamically, the most favored occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate consists of 1 H$_2$ molecule in the D cages and 3 in the H cages (named as 1-3 occupancy)."

The AMR ratio is found to strongly depend on the current orientation relative to the crystal axes, reaching 0.16 % and 0.10 % at room temperature when the current is applied along the magnetic hard and easy axes, respectively. Moreover, the AMR ratio decreases at different rates as the temperature is reduced to 80 K. The longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance curves were fitted using the Stoner-Wohlfarth formalism to describe the magnetization reversal path and to extract the magnetic anisotropy constants. The fitted cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants are Kc = -2.36 kJ/m3 and Ku = 2.18 kJ/m3, verifying the change in the cubic anisotropy compared to Fe-richer Fe100-xCox compositions.

We demonstrate that despite their distinct atomic origins, these orbitals host nearly identical hopping physics and spin-orbit coupling, formalized through an effective ${l=1}$ angular momentum algebra for the $t_{2g}$ case. This equivalence allows one to transpose physical intuition and theoretical models developed for $p$-orbital systems directly onto the more complex $t_{2g}$ materials, and vice versa. We showcase how this paradigm provides a unified understanding of emergent phenomena, including non-trivial band topology, itinerant ferromagnetism, and unconventional superconductivity, across a wide range of platforms, from transition metal compounds, two-dimensional oxide heterostructures, and iron-based superconductors, to $p$-orbital ultracold gases. Ultimately, this $p$-$t_{2g}$ homology serves not only as a tool for interpretation but also as a robust design principle for engineering novel quantum states."

      "summary": "Emerging spin-orbit-torque devices based on spin valves require an ultrathin (e.g., $\\lesssim$2 nm) magnetic free layer to maximize the torque per moment. However, reducing the free-layer thickness deteriorates the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) signal for electrical readout. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of a 1-nm Cu seed layer enables high GMR ratios of 5-7% at free-layer thicknesses of $\\lesssim$2 nm by promoting high-quality, textured growth of spin valves. Our work offers a pathway for engineering high-signal GMR readout in spin-orbit-torque digital memories and neuromorphic computers."

      "summary": "The impact of solid intruders into granular media is commonly described by a combination of quasi-static resistance and an inertial drag force proportional to the square of the impact speed. While intruder geometry is known to influence force magnitudes, its role in controlling the onset of inertial drag has remained largely unexplored. Here we present systematic impact experiments using conical intruders spanning a wide range of apex angles. By measuring the peak acceleration during impact, we show that the emergence of a well-defined inertial response depends sensitively on cone geometry. Blunt cones exhibit quadratic scaling with impact speed over the full range of velocities studied, whereas sharper cones display a delayed transition to inertial behavior at higher speeds. We define a geometry-dependent crossover speed marking the onset of the inertial regime and find that it scales approximately linearly with the cone angle through $\\tan\\phi$. Once the inertial regime is established, the peak force collapses when rescaled by $\\tan\\phi$, indicating that cone geometry controls the effective momentum transfer to the grains. These results demonstrate that intruder geometry governs not only the magnitude of inertial drag, but also the impact speed at which it becomes dominant."

      "summary": "The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized nickelates has renewed interest in the broken-symmetry states of their ambient-pressure parent phases, where a density-wave (DW) order emerges and competes with superconductivity, but its microscopic origin remains unresolved. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\\rm DW} \\approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates."

      "summary": "We study energy dissipation and propagation of information encoded by Josephson vortices in two types of circular shift register: a) a uniform register composed of sections of discrete Josephson transmission lines (JTL) forming a closed loop with a flux pump allowing to change the number of moving fluxon; b) a nonuniform register composed of sections of the regular JTL and sections of JTLs utilizing nSQUIDs - dc-SQUIDs with negative inductance between their arms - instead of single Josephson junctions. nSQUIDs are parametric devices with a flexible double-well potential that were proposed as components for reversible computing. For the uniform register, we demonstrate the energy dissipation per bit-shift operation below the Landauer's thermodynamic limit $E_T=k_BTln2$ up to propagation delays of ~0.7 ns, corresponding to the circular information motion with frequencies up to ~1.4 GHz. This does not contradict Landauer's minimum energy requirement for computations since information is not destroyed. For the nonuniform register, we find the minimum energy dissipation per bit-shift of about 16$E_T$ and attribute this to a nonuniform movement of vortices and energy barriers between the regular JTL and nSQUID sections. Differences of Josephson vortex propagation in both types of circular registers are discussed based on the measured current-voltage characteristics, extracted effective resistance and the terminal speed of Josephson vortices, and their dependences on the number of moving vorticies. nSQUID inductance connecting JJs to the ground leads to an unusual type of lossless discrete transmission line with frequency-dependent impedance and propagation speed, both different from the regular JTLs."

      "summary": "Deformable and flexible electronics have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties; however, their current applications are primarily limited to the thermoelectric domain. Expanding the range of these electronics and their application scope represents a pivotal trend in their development. In this work, a plastic inorganic semiconductor material, Sn2BiS2I3, with a band gap of 1.2 eV was synthesized and fabricated into a three-electrode flexible and portable electronic tongue capable of detecting heavy metal elements. The electronic tongue device exhibits exceptional linearity and demonstrates resistance against interference from impurity ions. The linear regression equation is expressed as Y=0.24+19.06X, yielding a linear coefficient of approximately 0.96, and the detectable limit stands at around 1.1 ppb, surpassing the 2.0 ppb limit of the ICP-AES instrument. Furthermore, mechanical testing reveals the favorable plasticity of Sn2BiS2I3, as evidenced by the absence of cracks during nanoindentation. The indentation hardness of Sn2BiS2I3 is approximately 1.67 GPa, slightly exceeding the hardness of Cu, which is 1.25 GPa. This study expands the repertoire of deformable and flexible electronics, offering a new and exceptional choice for biomimetic tongue sensor materials."

      "summary": "Chromatin is repeatedly deformed in vivo during transcription, nuclear remodeling, and confined migration - yet how mechanical response varies from locus to locus, and how it relates to epigenetic state, remains unclear. We develop a theory to infer locus-specific viscoelasticity from three-dimensional genome organization. Using chromatin structures derived from contact maps, we calculate frequency-dependent storage and loss moduli for individual loci and establish that the mechanical properties are determined both by chromatin epigenetic marks and organization. On large length scales, chromatin exhibits Rouse-like viscoelastic scaling, but this coarse behavior masks extensive heterogeneity at the single-locus level. Loci segregate into two mechanical subpopulations with distinct longest relaxation times: one characterized by single-timescale and another by multi-timescale relaxation. The multi-timescale loci are strongly enriched in active marks, and the longest relaxation time for individual loci correlates inversely with effective local stiffness. Pull-release simulations further predict a time-dependent susceptibility: H3K27ac-rich loci deform more under sustained forcing yet can resist brief, large impulses. At finer genomic scales, promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies emerge as \"viscoelastic islands\" aligned with their focal interactions. Together, these results suggest that chromatin viscoelasticity is an organized, epigenetically coupled property of the 3D genome, providing a mechanistic layer that may influence enhancer-promoter communication, condensate-mediated organization, and response to cellular mechanical stress. The prediction that locus-specific mechanics in chromatin are controlled by 3D structures as well as the epigenetic states is amenable to experimental test."

We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $\\beta\\approx1.00$, $\\delta\\approx0.5$, and $\\nu_{\\parallel}\\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $\\beta\\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of MF-DP dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to DP. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behaviour in socio-economic and active systems."

      "summary": "$SrVO_3$ (SVO), a model correlated metal and a promising transparent conducting oxide, develops a several-nanometer-thick near-surface region (NSR), rich in $V^{5+}$ species under ambient conditions. This oxidized layer obscures the intrinsic correlated-metallic $V^{4+}$ character and limits both fundamental studies of the physics and the material's integration into electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a direct and controllable approach for recovering the metallic SVO surface by thermally reducing the NSR under ultra-high vacuum. Real-time in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals a sharp transformation from a $V^{5+}$-dominated surface to mixed valence states, dominated by $V^{4+}$, and a recovery of its metallic character. Ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) suggest that this transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution and partial oxygen loss, leading to nanoscale surface reorganization and modest lattice expansion. While thermodynamic considerations motivate evaluation of a $V_2O_5$ volatilization pathway, the combined experimental evidence instead points toward a predominantly structural surface reorganization. These findings establish a practical method for obtaining predominantly $V^{4+}$ SVO surfaces without protective capping layers, a capability that expands the utility of SVO for advanced spectroscopies, interface engineering, and oxide-electronics device integration."

      "summary": "Information flow between subsystems is a central concept in information thermodynamics, which provides the second-law-like inequalities for subsystems. This paper discusses the geometric decomposition of information flow, which was introduced for Markov jump systems [Y Maekawa, R Nagayama, K Yoshimura and S Ito, arXiv:2509.21985 (2025)], and applies it to overdamped Langevin systems. For overdamped Langevin systems, the geometric decomposition of information flow into excess and housekeeping contributions is related to the conventional definition of the $2$-Wasserstein distance between marginal distributions in optimal transport theory. This formulation offers an optimal-transport interpretation of subsystem dynamics, and this optimal-transport formulation is simpler for overdamped Langevin systems than for general Markov jump systems. It is also possible to handle features that are specific to overdamped Langevin systems, such as representations based on the Koopman mode decomposition, as well as their relationship with the Fisher information matrix. As with the results for Markov jump systems, we generalize the second law of information thermodynamics using housekeeping and excess information flow, leading to the concept of excess and housekeeping demons. We also derive a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and an information-thermodynamic speed limit incorporating excess information flow. These results are illustrated for the Gaussian case, and we discuss the conditions under which the excess and housekeeping demons emerge."

      "summary": "Cellular organization and mechanotransduction pathways are crucial regulators of tissue morphogenesis, whereas their dysregulation contributes to pathologies. Overactive fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, are key drivers of fibrosis, yet how their presence alters collective cellular ordering remains unclear. Inspired by the analogy between liquid crystals and cells, we investigate how topological defects influence reorganization in dense monolayers of co-cultured fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Owing to steric interactions, these elongated cells exhibit local order; topological defects, where alignment is disrupted, have been postulated to serve as mechanical centers. In this study, we examine how the incorporation of contractile myofibroblasts impacts defect relaxation. The behavior is reminiscent of active nematics with quenched disorder: myofibroblast concentration modulates the disorder strength; increasing their fraction slows defect recombination. Higher myofibroblast concentrations similarly reduce the overall cell alignment on microgrooved surfaces, as myofibroblasts interfere with monolayer reorganization. This observation highlights the potential of a simple, quantitative assay for diagnosing disease progression. Furthermore, we found that myofibroblasts preferentially localize at negatively charged -1/2 defects, compared to fibroblasts, which tend to be localized in +1/2 defects. Consequently, the slowdown of recombination dynamics can be partially attributed to the reduced velocity of the more mobile +1/2 defects. Our study suggests that myofibroblasts can exploit negatively charged defects by avoiding regions of compressive stress and evading apoptosis. Combining live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence studies, this work provides insights into the role of topological defects in fibrotic disease progression."

      "summary": "Understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is essential for advancing next-generation high-strength steels, thereby motivating the development of highly accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for the Fe-H binary system. However, the substantial computational expense associated with existing MLIPs has limited their applicability in practical, large-scale simulations. In this study, we construct a new MLIP within the Performant Implementation of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (PACE) framework, trained on a comprehensive HE-related dataset generated through a concurrent-learning strategy. The resulting potential achieves density functional theory-level accuracy in reproducing a wide range of lattice defects in alpha-Fe and their interactions with hydrogen, including both screw and edge dislocations. More importantly, it accurately captures the deformation and fracture behavior of nanopolycrystals containing hydrogen-segregated general grain boundaries-phenomena not explicitly represented in the training data. Despite its high fidelity, the developed potential requires computational resources only several tens of times greater than empirical potentials and is more than an order of magnitude faster than previously reported MLIPs. By delivering both a high-precision and computationally efficient potential, as well as a generalizable methodology for constructing such models, this study significantly advances the atomic-scale understanding of HE across a broad range of metallic materials."

      "summary": "Topological magnetic textures are particle-like spin configurations stabilized by competing interactions. Their formation is commonly attributed to fluctuation-driven, first-order nucleation processes requiring activation over a topological energy barrier. Here, we demonstrate an alternative barrier- and fluctuation-free pathway for nucleating topological magnetic textures, triggered in our experiments by an excitation-induced spin reorientation transition. By combining x-ray imaging, scattering and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the system follows a deterministic cascade of symmetry-breaking phase transitions after excitation. First, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition from a homogeneous state to weak stripe domains, then a first-order transition to topologically trivial bubbles, and finally a topological switching event into skyrmionic textures. Through simulations, we generalize our findings and demonstrate that this pathway is active in a vast range of low-anisotropy materials. This previously unrecognized, spontaneous transition pathway suggests strategies for rapid, low-energy generation of topological spin textures and points to a general role of intrinsic modulational instabilities in phase transitions beyond magnetism."

We show how some weak symmetries of the Lindblad equation allow us to map the dynamics onto a classical Kinetic Monte Carlo; this simplified, effective dynamics can be described via local stochastic jumps coupled with a local deterministic component. Simulations are then used to reconstruct a phase diagram which displays stationary features completely equivalent to those of completely classical epidemic processes, but richer dynamics with multiple, recurrent waves of infection."

We solve the scattering problem in closed form and demonstrate that the nanoslide gives rise to a hybrid pseudogauge and electrostatic cavity in the bipolar regime, and hosts one-dimensional transverse channels. The latter can be tuned using a bottom gate between valley chiral or counterpropagating modes, as well as one-dimensional flatbands. Hence, the local density of states near the barrier depends strongly on the gate voltage with a tunable sublattice and electron-hole asymmetry. In the presence of electron-electron interactions, the nanoslide allows for in-situ tuning between a chiral and ordinary Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid."

These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to model the Andreev spin qubit, where quantum information is encoded in spinful odd-parity subgap states. Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations. Electron-electron interaction admixes single-occupancy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) components into the ABS states, thereby strongly enhancing spin transitions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The ABS states can thus become sensitive to local magnetic field fluctuations, which has implications for decoherence in Andreev pair qubits. For strong interaction $U$, especially in the cross-over region between the ABS and YSR regimes for $U \\sim 2\\Delta$, charge, spin, and inductive transitions can all become strong, offering avenues for spin control and quantum transduction."

In this study, we present a simply trained, but yet efficient, non-density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) capable of simulating the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes and bulk titanium carbide and nitride with precision comparable to DFT calculations. The training process for the MLIP is delineated herein, in conjunction with a series of dynamical tests.

However, synthesis often yields undesired ordered oxygen-deficient phases, such as bixbyite, depending on composition and processing conditions. We utilize first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate phase stability in the model system Ce$_x$(YLaPrSm)$_{1-x}$O$_{2-\\delta}$, with the aim of elucidating the thermodynamic factors governing fluorite-bixbyite competition and identifying structure-property relationships to oxygen transport. By independently varying cerium concentration and oxygen vacancy content, we predict that the transition from disordered fluorite to ordered bixbyite is driven primarily by compositional and vacancy-ordering effects, rather than through changes in cation valence. Free-energy analysis reveals that at high vacancy concentrations, bixbyite is enthalpically favored due to ordered oxygen vacancies, while fluorite is stabilized at lower vacancy concentrations and higher cerium content through configurational entropy of the anion sublattice. These DFT results clarify the competing energetic contributions that control phase stability and structure-valence relationships in LN-HEOs and establishes a mechanistic framework for designing vacancy-tolerant oxide electrolytes with tunable phase behavior."

To understand the biophysical processes underpinning lipid-lipid interactions in these systems, synthetic membrane models are crucial. Here, we demonstrate the formation of tubular networks from supported lipid membranes of controlled lipid composition on glass. We quantify tube radii using quantitative differential interference contrast (qDIC) and propose a biophysical mechanism for the formation of these structures, regulated by surface tension and lipid exchange with connected supported membranes. Two lipid types are investigated, namely DOPC and DC15PC, exhibiting a liquid disordered and a solid ordered phase at room temperature, respectively. Tube formation is studied versus temperature, revealing bilamellar layers retracting and folding into tubes upon DC15PC lipids transitioning from liquid to solid phase, which is explained by lipid transfer from bilamellar to unilamellar layers. This study introduces a novel model system for bilayer tubes, allowing to elucidate the biophysics of lipid-lipid interactions governing lipid membrane reshaping into tubular structures, important for our understanding of biological membrane filaments."

      "summary": "We develop a geometric foundation of microcanonical thermodynamics in which entropy and its derivatives are determined from the geometry of phase space, rather than being introduced through an a priori ensemble postulate. Once the minimal structure needed to measure constant -- energy manifolds is made explicit, the microcanonical measure emerges as the natural hypersurface measure on each energy shell. Thermodynamics becomes the study of how these shells deform with energy: the entropy is the logarithm of a geometric area, and its derivatives satisfy a deterministic hierarchy of entropy flow equations driven by microcanonical averages of curvature invariants (built from the shape/Weingarten operator and related geometric data). Within this framework, phase transitions correspond to qualitative reorganizations of the geometry of energy manifolds, leaving systematic signatures in the derivatives of the entropy. Two general structural consequences follow. First, we reveal a thermodynamic covariance: the reconstructed thermodynamics is invariant under arbitrary descriptive choices such as reparametrizations and equivalent representations of the same conserved dynamics. Second, a geometric microcanonical equivalence is found: microscopic realizations that share the same geometric content of their energy manifolds (in the sense of entering the curvature sources of the flow) necessarily yield the same microcanonical thermodynamics. We demonstrate the full practical power of the formalism by reconstructing microcanonical response and identifying criticality across paradigmatic systems, from exactly solvable mean-field models to genuinely nontrivial short-range lattice field theories and the 1D long-range XY model with $1/r^\\alpha$ interactions."

Both the magnitude and orientation of the photostrictive strains can be tuned by photodoping densities, enabling precise control over the photoinduced response. Notably, the photoinduced strains significantly increase carrier recombination lifetimes by suppressing nonradiative recombination, primarily due to the enlarged bandgap and weakened nonadiabatic coupling.

This framework naturally incorporates strong spatial inhomogeneity and yields the AC conductivity directly from the effective potential. The standard MB result is recovered as a limiting case.

This behaviour originates from the magnetic entropy of nuclear spins, suggesting a magnetic field should influence it. However, its detailed response to magnetic fields remains elusive due to the small nuclear magneton of 3He and lack of analogous fermion systems. Here, we show that an electron system also exhibit the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, unlike conventional electron systems where a field melts an electron solid into a metal. Remarkably, the electron system displays a reentrant liquid state in ultrahigh fields. These responses are explained by changes in magnetic entropy and magnetisation, extending the underlying physics to 3He. Our findings clarify magnetic-field impact on the Pomeranchuk effect and open avenues for magnetic control of chemical interactions."

      "summary": "The interplay between laser parameters and liquid environments dictates the outcome of femtosecond laser-induced nanoparticle modification. We present a study of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles in water and a water-acetone mixture, irradiated with femtosecond lasers at 808 nm and 404 nm. While aggregation was observed in pure water at both wavelengths, the results revealed a strong stability and a rather unexpected wavelength-dependency in the acetone-water mixture. In this case, 808 nm irradiation produced some decrease in nanoparticle sizes, while 404 nm led to some nanoparticle growth. As a result, the acetone effect is found to be twofold: (i) on one hand, it helps to prevent aggregation; (ii) on the other hand, it acts as a reactive medium allowing to tune the nanoparticle size and composition simply by changing laser wavelength. So, this work emphasizes that solvent physical properties as well as laser-induced chemical processes in the solvent are not merely secondary effects but can dominate the final morphological outcome, providing a predictive framework for nanoparticle synthesis."

Functionalizing graphene with platinum (Pt) adatoms can further enhance its properties, particularly for hydrogen storage applications. In this study, we experimentally investigate hydrogen adsorption on Pt-decorated graphene using Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA). By irradiating the Pt/graphene film with a 4.1 MeV C2+ ion beam and detecting recoiled hydrogen atoms at a 30 degree scattering angle, we obtain the hydrogen depth profile, providing critical insights into its storage behavior."

      "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique opportunities to realize emergent phenomena by reducing dimensionality. Using scanning tunneling microscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we determine an intriguing case of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a bulk compound, (TBA)$_{0.3}$VSe$_2$. Atomic-scale imaging reveals that the initial $4a_0 \\times 4a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) order in 1T-VSe$_2$ transforms to $\\sqrt{7}a_0 \\times \\sqrt{3}a_0$ ordering upon intercalation, which is associated with an insulating gap with a magnitude of up to approximately 115 meV. Our calculations reveal that this energy gap is highly tunable through electron doping introduced by the intercalant. Moreover, the robustness of the $\\sqrt{7}a_0 \\times \\sqrt{3}a_0$ CDW order against the Lifshitz transition points to the key role of electron-phonon interactions in stabilizing the CDW state. Our work clarifies a rare example of a CDW-driven MIT in quasi-2D materials and establishes cation intercalation as an effective pathway for tuning both the dimensionality and the carrier concentration without inducing strain or disorder."

They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $\\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $\\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal."

      "summary": "Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials."

      "summary": "Directional memory in amorphous solids is commonly quantified through the Bauschinger effect, yet the observation of the inverse Bauschinger effect suggests that the sign of memory can invert, pointing to distinct underlying plastic organization. Here, we connect directional memory to the nature of yielding in steadily sheared amorphous solids. Using simulations of two-dimensional polydisperse glasses, we show that the type of directional memory (Bauschinger versus inverse Bauschinger) is jointly controlled by deformation history, strain rate, and parent temperature. We identify a critical history amplitude $\\gamma_{N,\\mathrm{crit}}(T_p,\\dot{\\gamma})$ and construct a phase diagram that delineates regimes with memory inversion from those showing only conventional Bauschinger response. Microscopically, memory inversion correlates with network-like shear-band morphology and plastic healing, whereas conventional memory is associated with persistent localization and cumulative damage. These results establish directional memory as an order parameter for a shear-rate and annealing-controlled brittle-ductile crossover and suggest that plastic healing provides a generic route to memory inversion in disordered solids."

      "summary": "Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable."

      "summary": "We investigate the effects of thermal fluctuations in graphene bilayers by means of a nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) approach, following the pioneering work of Mauri et al. [Phys. Rev. B 102, 165421 (2020)] based on a self-consistent screening approximation (SCSA). We consider a model of two continuum polymerized membranes, separated by a distance $\\ell$, in their flat phase, coupled by interlayer shear, compression/dilatation and elastic terms. Within a controlled truncation of the effective average action, we retain only the contributions that generate a pronounced crossover of the effective bending rigidity along the renormalization group flow between two regimes: at high running scale $k$, the rigidity is dominated by the in-plane elastic properties, with $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\sim \\ell^{2}(\\lambda+2\\mu)/2$, whereas at low $k$ it is controlled by the bending rigidity of two independent monolayers, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\sim 2\\kappa$. This crossover is reminiscent of that observed by Mauri et al. as a function of the wavevector scale $q$, but here it is obtained within a renormalization group framework. This has several advantages. First, although approximations are performed, the NPRG approach allows one, in principle, to take into account all nonlinearities present in the elastic theory, in contrast to the SCSA treatment which requires, already at the formal level, significant simplifications. Second, it demonstrates that the bilayer problem can be treated as a straightforward extension of the monolayer case, with flow equations that keep the same structure and differ only by bilayer-specific adjustments. Third, unlike the SCSA, the NPRG framework admits a controlled, systematically improvable, hierarchy of approximations."

      "summary": "Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems."

      "summary": "The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects."

The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions."

      "summary": "Order versus disorder in the structure of materials plays a key role in the theoretical prediction of their properties. However, this structural description appears to be ineffective for new families of materials such as high entropy alloys (HEAs), which combine crystallographic order with chemical disorder. Here, we demonstrate for five-element HEAs as pure solid solutions that the chemical disorder of the elements decorating their cubic structure underlies the generation of second optical harmonics, overcoming the theoretical limit imposed on centrosymmetric crystals. Moreover, we discover that this disorder, inherent to HEAs, sets a threshold for non-linear light emission from the 4th to the 26th order. As a consequence of the 0.5 eV broadening of the energy levels of the five elements of the HEA, the emission spectrum covers broad visible (400-650 nm) and infrared (800-1600 nm) ranges. In addition to the challenge of theoretically predicting non-linear effects in unconventional materials, the duality of structural order and chemical disorder in HEAs offers the opportunity to design sustainable alternatives to urgently needed optical materials."

It is generally believed that the QAH effect can only be realized in insulators. In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate that the QAH effect can also be realized in metallic systems, representing a phase distinct from the conventional QAH phase in insulators. This phase is characterized by the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels without a bulk energy gap. Notably, in a six-terminal Hall bar, our calculations show that, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can emerge due to dephasing, despite the Hall resistivity itself never becoming quantized. Furthermore, the quantized Hall conductivity exhibits remarkable robustness against disorder. Our findings not only extend the range of materials capable of hosting the QAH effect from insulators to metals, but also provide insights that may pave the way for the experimental realization of the QAH effect at elevated temperatures."

      "summary": "Ultrafast electric manipulation of magnetic order in solids is critical for the development of future terahertz data processing. A fascinating concept for such high-speed operation is offered in metallic antiferromagnets by N\\'eel spin-orbit torque. It should allow one to coherently rotate the ordered spins by simply applying an electric current of suitable amplitude and polarity. However, such switching has been severely hampered by competing heat-induced effects, and it has not yet been achieved on the intrinsically ultrafast time scales of antiferromagnets. Here, we report robust, direction-controlled and non-thermal rotation of the N\\'eel vector $\\mathbf{L}$ by $\\pm$90{\\deg} at room temperature in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au driven by phase-locked terahertz current pulses. All observed features are consistent with ultrafast N\\'eel spin-orbit torque: First, nonlinear optical imaging reveals that the terahertz current direction sets the final orientation of $\\mathbf{L}$ in the absence of any bias field for at least two months. Second, transient optical birefringence shows that the switching proceeds ultrafast in less than 15 picoseconds. Finally, atomistic spin-dynamics simulations reproduce the observed dynamics and confirm the minor role of thermal effects. While the switching is already one order of magnitude faster than in ferromagnets at comparable dissipated energy, our simulations predict routes toward switching times and energies which are another order of magnitude lower. Our approach can be transferred to electric-field-driven switching in many more antiferromagnets, including magnetoelectric insulators. The engineering of spin torques, resonance frequencies and read-out mechanisms provides an exciting pathway toward on-chip applications of terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbitronics."

      "summary": "At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency {\\it anomalous} CSL can be realized in Swap Models, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap Models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We have used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the diamagnetic response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL."

      "summary": "Theoretical simulation is helpful for accurate interpretation of experimental X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra that contain rich atomic and electronic structure information of materials. However, current simulation methods are usually too complex to give the needed accuracy and timeliness when a large amount of data need to be analyzed, such as for in-situ characterization of battery materials. To address these problems, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for XANES prediction. However, instead of using experimental XANES data, the existing models are trained using simulated data, resulting in significant discrepancies between the predicted and experimental spectra. Also, the universality across different elements has not been well studied for such models. In this work, we firstly establish a crystal graph neural network, pre-trained on simulated XANES data covering 48 elements, to achieve universal XANES prediction with a low average relative square error of 0.020223; and then utilize transfer learning to calibrate the model using a small experimental XANES dataset. After calibration, the edge energy misalignment error of the predicted S, Ti and Fe K edge XANES is significantly reduced by about 55%. The method demonstrated in this work opens up a new way to achieve fast, universal, and experiment-calibrated XANES prediction."

      "summary": "Controllable quasiparticle radiation in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for efficient carrier recombination, tunable emission, and modulation of valley polarization which are strongly determined by both the density and nature of underlying excitonic species. Conventional chemical doping techniques, however, often hinder the reversibility and density of excitonic charge states (exciton and trion) due to unfavorable interactions between dopant and 2D materials. In this work, efficient excitonic charge state conversion is achieved by doping monolayer WS$_2$ using water rinsed PVA and the quasiparticle densities are further enhanced by applying high periodic biaxial strain (up to 2.3%) through a 2D silica microsphere array. The method presented here enables nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion without the need of electrostatic gating, while delivering thermally stable trions with a large binding energy of ~56 meV and a high free electron density of ~3$\\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Strain-induced funneling of the PVA-injected free electrons substantially increases the excitonic quasiparticle densities and boosts the trion emission by 41%. Overall, this approach establishes a versatile platform for excitonic charge state conversion and enhanced quasiparticle density in 2D materials, offering promising opportunities for future optical data storage, quantum-light and display technologies."

      "summary": "Using quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography techniques, we have studied in-situ and in real-time the nucleation and co-growth dynamics of the peritectic structures in an Al-Mn alloy during solidification. We collected ~30 TB 4D datasets which allow us to elucidate the phases' co-growth dynamics and their spatial, crystallographic and compositional relationship. The primary Al4Mn hexagonal prisms nucleate and grow with high kinetic anisotropy -70 times faster in the axial direction than the radial direction. In all cases, a ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layer forms at the liquid-solid interface, creating a sharp local solute gradient that governs subsequent phase transformation. The peritectic Al6Mn phases nucleate epitaxially within this diffusion zone, initially forming a thin shell surrounding the Al4Mn with an orientation relationship of {10-10}HCP // {110}O, [0001]HCP // [001]O. Such ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layers also cause solute depletion at the liquid side of the liquid-solid interface, limiting further epitaxial phase growth, but prompting phase re-nucleation and branching at crystal edges, resulting tetragonal prism structures that no longer follow the initial orientation relationship. The anisotropic diffusion also led to the formation of core defects at the centre of both phases. Furthermore, increasing cooling rate from 0.17 to 20 {\\deg}C/s can disrupt the stability of the solute diffusion zone, effectively suppressing the formation of the core defects and forcing a transition from faceted to non-faceted morphologies. Our work establishes a new theoretical framework for how to tailor and control the peritectic structures in metallic alloys through solidification processes."

In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components.

Our mechanism does not require breaking time-reversal symmetry in the effective superconducting Hamiltonian, but instead relies on nonequilibrium spin injection. We further demonstrate that superconductivity enhances spin injection due to the large quasiparticle density of states near the pairing gap, an effect that persists well below the gap. This contrasts with earlier works predicting the absence of spin injection at zero temperature and small spin voltages. Our results provide a natural explanation for long-standing experimental observations of spin injection in superconductors and predict novel effects arising from spin-charge coupling, including the electrical control of anomalous phase gradients in superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling. These effects are broadly testable in a variety of materials and hybrid superconducting structures."

Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms driving their friction-reducing effects remain unclear, especially for phosphate esters, whose molecular structure critically impact tribological behavior. In this study, we use machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological performance of three representative phosphorus-based additives, Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), and Methyl Polyethylene Glycol Phosphate (mPEG-P), on iron surfaces. The mPEG-P family is further analyzed by varying esterification degree and chain length. DBHP exhibits the lowest friction and largest interfacial separation, resulting from steric hindrance and tribochemical reactivity, as indicated by P-O bond cleavage and enhanced O-Fe interactions. In contrast, OAP and mPEG-P monoesters produce higher friction due to limited steric protection and reduced resistance to shear, leading to partial loss of surface coverage under extreme conditions. Within the mPEG-P family, multi-ester and longer-chain molecules significantly lower friction by maintaining larger separations, demonstrating that steric effects can outweigh surface reactivity under severe confinement. Overall, these results provide atomistic insights into how molecular architecture controls additive performance and support the design of phosphorus-based lubricants combining reactive anchoring with optimized steric structures for durable, low-friction interfaces."

Consequently, deepening our understanding of mesophase stability, defect topology, and the dynamic response of LCs at the nanoscale requires the development of novel characterization approaches. This motivates us to perform in situ observations on model 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) LC using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM). We find that the electron beam induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic (SmA-N) and from nematic to isotropic (N-I). The kinetic dependence of the phase transition on dose rate shows that the time between SmA-N and N-I shortens with increasing rate, revealing the hypothesis that a higher electron dose rate increases the energy dissipation rate, leading to substantial heat generation in the sample. We report on the spontaneous formation of disclinations, ordering effects, and complete process reversibility. Radiolytic effects of the electron beam are discussed in detail, and additional experiments with external heating indicate that the observed phenomena are mainly thermal in nature. The results are supported by calculations of heat diffusion, suggesting the nanoconfined 8CB differs significantly in thermal properties compared to the bulk one. This is the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using LP-STEM, which paves the way for further studies of nanoconfined LCs and for the development of the technique for advanced LC materials research."

      "summary": "Recent years have seen a proliferation in investigations on Altermagnetism due to its exciting prospects both from an applications perspective and theoretical standpoint. Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices."

Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms."

In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $\\Gamma$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering."

      "summary": "Recent work that analyzed the effect of vacancy disorder on a short-range resonating valence bond spin liquid state of kagome-lattice antiferromagnets argued that such spin liquids are stable to vacancy disorder. The argument relied crucially on a numerical study that identified the following property of the site-diluted kagome lattice: maximum-density dimer packings (maximum matchings) of any connected component of such site-diluted kagome lattices have at most one unmatched vertex that hosts a monomer. Here, we provide an inductive proof of a stronger result that implies this property: If a connected cluster of such a lattice has an odd number of vertices, its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition~\\cite{Lovas_Plummer_1986} has exactly one ${\\mathcal R}$-type region that spans the entire connected cluster and hosts a single monomer of any maximum-density dimer packing. If on the other hand it has an even number of sites, it admits perfect matchings (fully-packed dimer coverings with no monomers) and its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition consists of a single ${\\mathcal P}$-type region that spans the entire cluster. Our proof also applies to the site-diluted Archimedean star lattice, the site-diluted pyrochlore lattice (corner-sharing tetrahedra), the site-diluted hyperkagome lattice, and, more generally, to any lattice satisfying a certain local connectivity property. It does not apply to bond-diluted versions of such lattices."

      "summary": "We investigate the dynamics of a run-and-tumble particle in a double-well potential and demonstrate that, in stark contrast to Brownian particles, active dynamics can lead to strong ergodicity breaking. When the barrier height exceeds a critical threshold, the long-time position distribution depends crucially on the initial condition: if the particle starts within the basin of attraction of one well, it remains trapped there, while if it begins between the two basins, it can reach either well with a finite probability, which we compute exactly via hitting probabilities. Below the critical barrier height, ergodicity is restored and the system converges to a unique stationary distribution, which we derive analytically. Using this result, we also estimate the characteristic barrier crossing time and show that it violates Kramer's-Arrhenius law, and displays a divergence near the critical height following a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-like form with an anomalous exponent $1/2$."

This lamellar nickelate is an isostructural analogue of the high-temperature cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, for which recent experiments uncovered evidence for unusual structural and superconducting fluctuations indicative of rare-region physics due to inherent inhomogeneity unrelated to common point disorder effects. We find closely analogous nanoscale orthorhombic fluctuation behavior in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$, including exponential scaling of the diffuse scattering intensity and power-law scaling of the characteristic length with relative temperature. Moreover, our neutron and x-ray scattering data reveal similar behavior for short-range magnetic and charge fluctuations above the respective ordering temperatures. These observations indicate that rare-region effects are a generic feature of perovskite-related structures and lead to universal fluctuations of both structural and electronic degrees of freedom over extended temperature ranges."

Focusing on two paradigmatic models, interacting spinless fermions and the Hubbard model, we first directly confirm that the universal operator growth hypothesis holds for interacting fermionic systems, manifested by the linear growth of Lanczos coefficients. Equipped with symbolically computed Lanczos coefficients and knowledge of their asymptotics, we are able to compute infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions up to times long enough for thermalization to occur. In turn, the knowledge of autocorrelation functions unlocks transport properties. We compute with high precision the charge diffusion constant over a broad range of interaction strengths, $V$. Surprisingly, we observe that these results are well described by a simple functional dependence $\\sim 1/V^2$ universally valid both for small and large $V$. All results are obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our results highlight the promise of symbolic computational paradigm where the most costly step is performed once and outputs symbolic results that can further be used multiple times to easily compute physical quantities for specific values of model parameters."

Since the energy gradient is proportional to the group velocity, our result establishes an experimentally accessible correspondence between the Bloch vector field and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We discuss a mapping between the gradient of the energy dispersion and the Bloch vector.

      "summary": "Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ has been refined in the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase without octahedral rotations, and its physical properties have been interpreted in this high-symmetry structure. However, the dynamical stability of this undistorted phase has not previously been questioned. It is important to establish whether other lower-symmetry structures are energetically more favorable because octahedral rotations control electronic bandwidths and constrain which magnetic interactions are allowed by symmetry. Here I compute first-principles phonon dispersions of $I4/mmm$ Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ including spin-orbit interaction. I find a nearly-flat nondegenerate unstable branch along the Brillouin-zone boundary segment $XP$ associated with inplane rotations of the IrO$_6$ octahedra. Using group-theoretical analysis, I enumerate the symmetry-allowed distortions associated with the $X_2^+$ and $P_4$ instabilities and fully relax the resulting structures. Only five of the twelve possible distortions can be stabilized, and the energy gain scales with the number of layers that exhibit octahedral rotations: phases with rotations in every IrO$_6$ layer are lower by $-5.8$ meV/atom and are nearly degenerate with respect to the stacking phase. Electronic structure calculations show that these rotated phases host a narrow and well-separated half-filled $J_{\\textrm{eff}} = 1/2$ manifold, whereas structures with rotations only in alternate layers have broader and more entangled bands. This motivates a reinvestigation of the crystal structure of Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and indicates that octahedral rotations should be considered in modeling its correlated electronic and magnetic properties."

      "summary": "Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases."

We present an expert-grounded automatic prompt optimization framework that enhances LLM entity extraction reliability. Using high-entropy alloy lattice constant extraction as a testbed, we optimized prompts for Claude 3.5 Sonnet through feedback cycles on seven expert-annotated publications. Despite a modest optimization budget, recall improved from 0.27 to > 0.9, demonstrating that a small, expert-curated dataset can yield significant improvements. The approach was applied to extract lattice constants from 2,267 publications, yielding data for 1,861 compositions. The optimized prompt transferred effectively to newer models: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash. Analysis revealed three categories of LLM mistakes: contextual hallucination, semantic misinterpretation, and unit conversion errors, emphasizing the need for validation protocols. These results establish feedback-guided prompt optimization as a low-cost, transferable methodology for reliable scientific data extraction, providing a scalable pathway for complex LLM-assisted research tasks."

Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter.

      "summary": "With the availability of ever-increasing computational capabilities, robust and automated research workflows are essential to enable and facilitate the execution and orchestration of large numbers of interdependent simulations in supercomputer facilities. However, the execution of these workflows still typically requires technical expertise in setting up calculation inputs, interpreting outputs, and handling the complexity of parallel code execution on remote machines. To address these challenges, the AiiDAlab platform was developed, making complex computational workflows accessible through an intuitive user interface that runs in a web browser. Here, we discuss how AiiDAlab has matured over the past few years, shifting its focus from computational materials science to become a powerful platform that accelerates scientific discovery across multiple disciplines. Thanks to its design, AiiDAlab allows scientists to focus on their research rather than on computational details and challenges, while keeping automatically track of the full simulation provenance via the underlying AiiDA engine and thus ensuring reproducibility. In particular, we discuss its adoption into quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and even experimental data analysis at large-scale facilities, while also being actively used in educational settings. Driven by user feedback, significant effort has been made to simplify user onboarding, streamline access to computational resources, and provide robust mechanisms to work with large datasets. Furthermore, AiiDAlab is being integrated with electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs), reinforcing adherence to the FAIR principles and supporting researchers in data-centric scientific disciplines in easily generating reproducible Open Research Data (ORD)."

For this purpose, we use the multiple natural configurations in conjunction with the multi-continuum theory of Bedford and Stern~(1972).

The proposed kinematics results in a three-term decomposition of the deformation gradient i.e. $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{F}^e\\mathbf{F}^r_\\alpha\\mathbf{F}^d_\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ represents either the matrix or the fiber. After discussing the kinematic framework in detail, we use this new kinematic framework to characterize the damage contents associated with four damage mechanisms. These damage mechanisms are matrix cracking, fiber breakage, interfacial slip or debonding, and delamination. While the first two are derived by measuring the incompatibility of the pertinent configuration occupied by individual constituents, the latter two involve a relative displacement between either the constituents or the lamin\\ae. The geometric interpretation corresponding to these damage mechanisms is also presented using tools from differential geometry. The derived damage contents can be used in developing an appropriate constitutive model for laminated composites undergoing damage."

The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force."

Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability."

Using a combination of polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon photoluminescence (2PPL) spectroscopy, we identify clear phase- and morphology-dependent anisotropic nonlinear responses. Triangular \\zbAgI $(111)$ flakes exhibit sixfold SHG symmetry and isotropic 2PPL emission, while rod-shaped \\wzAgI $(101)$ samples display twofold-symmetric patterns in both SHG and 2PPL, which are explained by polarization analysis using second- and third- order nonlinear susceptibilities. These findings establish AgI as a promising halide semiconductor platform for phase-selective nonlinear optics and quantum photonic applications."

While conventional bulk characterization techniques provide volume-averaged defect properties, they lack the spatial resolution to resolve nanoscale charge heterogeneity and identify microscopic noise sources. Here, we utilize single PL5 centers in 4H-SiC as room-temperature broadband quantum sensors to fill in the gap. We report the first real-time, nanoscale observation of singlecharge tunneling dynamics in a commercial semiconductor at room temperature, by monitoring the random telegraph noise using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). This capability enables an electrical noise imaging technique, showing distinct noise variations across different wafer substrates. By employing dynamical decoupling, we extend noise spectroscopy from near-DC to MHz frequencies, uncovering significant noise spectral density correlations across frequency bands. Finally, we probe MHz-GHz noise and identify its origin via T1 relaxation spectroscopy, obtaining the first nanoscale electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic fingerprint of charge defects in SiC. These techniques open avenues for characterizing noise environments in semiconductor devices, providing critical insights for optimizing SiC fabrication processes, defect control, and advancing quantum technologies."

      "summary": "Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a \"human-in-the-loop\" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic \"gatekeeper,\" regulating oxidation through a \"breathing mode\" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a \"rupture mode\" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design."

However, the latter possibility has been less explored so far and further thorough investigations are desired. In this study, we are thus developing a microscopic model based on spin-2 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for neutron $^3$P$_2$ superfluid vortices coupled with Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for fluxtubes associated with superconducting $^1\\text{S}_0$ protons. In this contribution, we outline our theoretical framework and report tentative results showing how shape of quantum vortices could be affected by the presence of a proton fluxtube."

Motivated by recent single-Weyl proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation, we argue that the corresponding single-Weyl Hamiltonians are obtained from the minimal-doubling Hamiltonians supplemented by an appropriate species-splitting mass term, and we re-examine the non-onsite symmetry protecting the physical Weyl node in terms of a Ginsparg-Wilson-type relation. We then construct a one-parameter family of deformations that preserves all the symmetries and demonstrate that, once the parameter exceeds a critical value, additional Weyl nodes emerge and the system exits the single-node regime. This indicates that in interacting theories radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, so maintaining the desired single-Weyl phase generically requires \"moderate\" parameter tuning."

Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations."

      "summary": "The possibility that evolutionary forces -- together with a few fundamental factors such as thermodynamic constraints, specific computational features enabling information processing, and ecological processes -- might constrain the logic of living systems is tantalizing. However, it is often overlooked that any practical implementation of such a logic requires complementary circuitry that, in biological systems, happens through complex networks of genetic regulation, metabolic reactions, cellular signalling, communication, social and eusocial non-trivial organization. We review and discuss how circuitries are not merely passive structures, but active agents of change that, by means of hierarchical and modular organization, are able to enhance and catalyze the evolution of evolvability. Using statistical physics to analyze the role of non-trivial topologies in major evolutionary transitions, we show that biological innovations are related to deviation from trivial structures and (thermo)dynamic equilibria. We argue that sparse heterogeneous networks such as hierarchical modular, which are ubiquitously observed in nature, are favored in terms of the trade-off between energetic costs for redundancy, error-correction and maintainance. We identify three main features -- namely, interconnectivity, plasticity and interdependency -- pointing towards a unifying framework for modeling the phenomenology, discussing them in terms of dynamical systems theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and evolutionary dynamics. Within this unified picture, we also show that slow evolutionary dynamics is an emergent phenomenon governed by the replicator-mutator equation as the direct consequence of a constrained variational nonequilibrium process. Overall, this work highlights how dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide powerful analytical techniques to study biological complexity."

However, the limited availability of suitable deformable or elastic microlaser materials is restricting the scale of forces that can be detected which strongly narrows their overall applicability. Here, we describe the synthesis of spherical whispering gallery mode microbead lasers from a commercially available elastomer material in a microfluidic system with high viscosity. Upon doping with organic dye molecules, the microbeads show excellent lasing characteristics with low lasing thresholds. Measurements of the mechanical properties reveal that the lasing characteristics are directly proportional to the applied external force. The measured Young's modulus confirms that the newly synthesized microlasers are very soft and can detect higher forces than previously applied deformable microlasers made from oil droplets. Furthermore, we show that elastomer microlasers are non-toxic and stable in aqueous environments, making them ideally suited for sensing forces inside tissues and small animals."

      "summary": "In this work, we investigate a simple nonequilibrium system with many interconnected, open subsystems, each exchanging a globally conserved resource with an external reserve. The system is represented by a random graph, where nodes represent the subsystems connected through edges. At each time step, a randomly selected node gains a token (i.e, a resource) from the reserve with probability (1-p) or loses a token to the reserve with probability p. When a node loses a token, its neighbors also lose a token each. This asymmetric token exchange breaks the detailed balance. We investigate the steady state behavior of our model for different types of random graphs: graphs without edges, regular graphs, Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi, and Barab\\'asi-Albert graphs. In all cases, the system exhibits a sharp, switch-like transition between a token-saturated state and an empty state. When the control parameter p is below a critical threshold, almost all tokens accumulate on the graph. Furthermore, in a non-regular graph, most tokens accumulate or condense on nodes of minimum degree. A slight increase in p beyond the threshold drains almost all the tokens from the graph. This switching transition results from the interplay between drift and the conservation of tokens. However, the position of the critical threshold and the behavior at the transition zone depend on graph topology."

In our previous work \\cite{CFS}, we analyzed the case of a completely wetted crystal and described how the interplay between surfactant evaporation and mass conservation leads to a transition between crystalline mean curvature flow and pinned evolutions. In the present paper, we extend the analysis to the regime of partial wetting, where the surfactant occupies only a portion of the interface. Within the minimizing-movements scheme, we rigorously derive the continuum evolution and show how partial wetting introduces a complex coupling between interfacial motion and redistribution of surfactant. The resulting evolution exhibits new features absent in the fully wetted case, including the coexistence of moving and pinned facets or the emergence and long-lived metastable states. This provides, to our knowledge, the first discrete-to-continuum variational description of partially wetted crystalline interfaces, bridging the gap between microscopic lattice models and experimentally observed surfactant-induced pinning phenomena in immiscible systems."

This value is the highest among known three-dimensional codes and nearly saturates the theoretical limit for topological codes. Our results further validate the generalized entropy relation for two mutually dual models, $H(p_{th}) + H(\\tilde{p}_{th}) \\approx 1$, and extend its applicability beyond standard topological codes. This verification indicates the Haah's code also possesses a code capacity near the theoretical limit $p_{th} \\approx 0.11$.

Nonetheless, even these approaches are eventually hindered by demanding computations due to sophisticated material response. Here, this issue is addressed for the advanced Self-Consistent Hydrodynamic Drude Model (SC-HDM), which captures both nonlocal electron dynamics and electron spill-out, through a Volume Integral Equation (VIE) method. Adopting an IE-based method shifts perspective from the commonly employed Differential Equation (DE)-based ones, demonstrating significant computational efficiency. The VIE approach is a valuable methodological scaffold: It addresses SC-HDM and simpler models, but can also be adapted to more advanced ones. For spherical nanoparticles (NPs), using the inherent symmetries, similar performance for three increasingly complicated material models is achieved, breaking the taboo that increased sophistication in material response requires taxing simulations. Mesoscopic material-response functions can be readily extracted from the VIE implementation, thus circumventing the need for lengthy microscopic calculations. This method opens a new way of modeling quantum hydrodynamic NPs and will serve as essential benchmarking tool for recipes addressing more complicated geometries."

To advance beyond these limitations, we propose a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model within the MO framework, with explicit inclusion of intramolecular vibrational motion. From this MO foundation, we derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion (MO-HEOM). As a demonstration, we analyze hydrogen molecules and hydrogen molecular ions with vibrational degrees of freedom, revealing their linear absorption spectra."

The FTRs we use are aluminum-based quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators terminated with 100um or 200um-wide square loop dc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing 1um-sized Josephson junctions. We employ SQUIDs with a geometric loop inductance of up to 0.7nH to increase the flux transfer efficiency. The geometric inductance of the SQUID results in a non-zero screening parameter $\\beta_L$, whose branch switching effect is mitigated by using asymmetric junctions. We achieve flux modulation of the FTRs by more than one GHz and flux responsivities of up to tens of GHz/$\\Phi_0$ with uA-scale on-chip currents. We compare flip-chip with on-chip input-coil-based flux modulation, where the former is realized through galvanically connected and closely spaced chips, while the latter is achieved through superconducting air-bridge connections. We achieve a flux-transfer efficiency from the input coil to the SQUID loop of up to 20%. Our work paves the way for efficient low current flux modulation of FTRs and sensitive measurement of flux signals."

      "summary": "H2O is a unique substance with exceptional thermal properties arising from the subtle interplay between its electronic, phononic, and structural degrees of freedom. Of particular interest in H2O are the negative thermal expansion (NTE) phenomena, observed in its solid phase (ice) at low temperature, and in its liquid phase (water) near the freezing temperature. Furthermore, ice and water exhibit the abnormal volume isotope effect (VIE), where volume expansions occur when replacing H with its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). In order to capture more conceptual and intuitive understanding of intriguing NTE and VIE phenomena in ice and water, we have explored isotope effects in their NTE and melting properties by employing a type of Born-Oppenheimer-approximation approach and the Lindemann criterion. Our findings demonstrate that unusual isotope effects in these phenomena stem from competition between zero-point-energy phonons, thermal phonons, and the hydrogen bonding in H2O. All these components originate from nuclear quantum mechanical (QM) processes, revealing that QM physics plays a crucial role in the seemingly classical ice/water systems."

However, how to enhance the efficiency in the artificial light-harvesting systems is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate the energy-transfer process in the photosystem I (PSI). When there is no effective coupling between the outer antenna (OA) and the reaction center (RC), the two light-harvesting networks are disconnected and thus the energy transfer is inefficient. In order to repair these disconnected networks, we introduce a bridge with three sites between them. We find that by modulating the level structure of the 3-site bridge to be resonant, the energy transfer via the dark state will be enhanced and even outperform the original PSI. Our discoveries may shed light on the designing mechanism of artificial light-harvesting systems."

In this work, we develop a continuum surface force (CSF) phase-field model to investigate the hydrodynamics of inextensible multicomponent vesicles in viscoelastic fluid flows with inertial forces. Our model couples a fluid field comprising both Newtonian and Oldroyd-B fluids, a surface concentration field representing the multicomponent distribution on the vesicle membrane, and a phase-field variable governing the membrane evolution. The viscoelasticity effect of extra stress is well incorporated into the full Navier-Stokes equations in the fluid field. The surface concentration field is determined by Cahn-Hilliard equations, while the membrane evolution is governed by a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation. The membrane is coupled to the surrounding fluid through the continuum surface force (CSF) framework. To ensure stable numerical solutions of the highly nonlinear multi-field model, we employ a residual-based variational multiscale (RBVMS) method for the Navier-Stokes equations, a Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for the Oldroyd-B equations, and a standard Galerkin finite element framework for the remaining equations. The system of PDEs is solved using an implicit, monolithic scheme based on the generalized-$\\alpha$ time integration method. To enhance spatial accuracy, we employ isogeometric analysis (IGA). We present a series of two-dimensional numerical examples in shear and Poiseuille flows to elucidate the influence of membrane composition and fluid viscoelasticity on the hydrodynamics of multicomponent vesicles."

      "summary": "Photonic topological insulators (PTIs) offer robust platforms for light manipulation, but reconfigurable control of their topological properties without degrading performance remains a major challenge. While phase-change materials (PCMs) provide large refractive index modulation, widely used materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) have been successfully deployed in commercial applications including optical data storage. However, they exhibit significant optical absorption in their crystalline state, which poses a challenge for transmissive photonic devices such as PTIs where high transparency is essential. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by integrating the ultra-low-loss PCM antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) onto a silicon-based 2D PTI. We achieve submicron-scale selective patterning of Sb2Se3 on a photonic crystal for the first time, and demonstrate a topological phase transition induced by the material phase change. Owing to the transparency of Sb2Se3 in both its amorphous and crystalline states, a high Q-factor on the order of 10^3 is preserved-representing nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous GST-based devices. This work resolves the absorption-loss bottleneck in reconfigurable PTIs and paves the way for practical, low-loss, tunable topological photonic devices."

Existing methods either require temporally resolved high-frequency observations, or rely on geometric arguments that apply only to conservative systems, limiting the range of dynamics they can recover. Here, we present a new framework that reconciles these two perspectives by reformulating inference as a stochastic control problem. Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating geometric inductive biases into stochastic system identification methods."

Present article has gone through systematic microscopic calculations of thermodynamical quantities like pressure, energy density, etc. of electron-fluid in graphene and compared with corresponding estimations for non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases. Identifying the Dirac fluid and Fermi liquid domains, we have sketched the transition of temperature and Fermi energy dependency of electron thermodynamics for graphene and other cases. An equivalent transition for quark matter is also discussed. The most exciting part is the general expression of specific heat, whose Fermi to Dirac fluid domain transition can be realized as a transition from a solid-based to a fluid-based picture. This understanding may be connected to the experimentally observed Wiedemann-Franz Law violation in the Dirac fluid domain of graphene system."

However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased."

However, no single study has simultaneously demonstrated all these phases. moreover, the existence of additional phases below 2 K or above 2 T for B perpenducular to c has been scarcely explored. This work presents the first comprehensive construction of the complex B-T phase diagram for T = 0.1 to 25 K and B = 0 to 9 T (B perpenducular to c), utilizing thermodynamic probes, magnetic measurements, and neutron scattering on a single batch of CBO crystals. Our findings elucidate new magnetic phases and regimes. First-principles calculations help to gain a deeper understanding of this complex phase diagram. The emergence of various phases within such a narrow B and T regime is attributed to two primary mechanisms: the delicate competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, and the weak exchange and superexchange interactions within and between the Cu(A) and Cu(B) sublattices. This competition also leads to a magnetically frustrated ground state at absolute zero where the total magnetic entropy release from high to low temperatures is only 0.76 Rln2, lower than Rln2 expected for copper spin 1/2. Using CBO as a model system, the present work elucidates the intricate mechanisms underlying the formation of complex magnetic phases."

      "summary": "Many functional materials, such as paints and inks used in applications like coating and 3D printing, are concentrated granular suspensions. In such systems, the contact line dynamics and the internal structure of the suspension interact through shear rate dependent viscosity and microstructural rearrangements. The local shear rate increases sharply near moving contact lines, leading to the non-Newtonian rheology of dense suspensions in this region. While hydrodynamic solutions can describe dilute suspensions, their applicability near advancing contact lines in dense suspensions remains unclear. This study quantifies the deviation from the Newtonian solution by systematically varying interparticle interactions through the choice of dispersion medium. We use silica particles suspended in two refractive index-matched fluids: (i) aqueous 2,2'-thiodiethanol (weak interactions) and (ii) aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution (strong interactions). These systems exhibit substantially different rheological responses, shear-thickening and yield-stress behaviour, respectively. Using astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry (APTV), we resolve the three-dimensional trajectories of tracer particles within a drop driven over a substrate, in an arrangement enabling tracking the internal flows over a long travel distance of the drop. We observe distinct flow behaviours depending on the particle interactions and the resulting suspension rheology. The more the particle interactions play a role, i.e., the more pronounced the non-Newtonian effects are, the stronger the measured flow profiles differ from the Newtonian solution to the hydrodynamic equations. In the shear-thickening suspension, a notable deviation from Newtonian behaviour is observed. Conversely, the yield-stress suspension exhibits plug flow over the substrate, with Newtonian-like behaviour restricted to the yielded region near the substrate."

      "summary": "By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry."

Then, we utilize the well-known Haldane-Hubbard model to identify the odd-parity spin splitting in the collinear ALM ground state where the nonmagnetic TRS is broken by sublattice currents coming from the Haldane hopping.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin."

      "summary": "The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is widely used for modeling disordered materials under periodic boundary conditions, with the ATAT mcsqs module being one of the most established implementations. However, SQS generation with mcsqs typically relies on manual preparation of input files, ad hoc execution scripts, and post-processing steps, which introduces user-dependent errors and limits reproducibility. Here, we present SimplySQS (https://simplysqs.com), an automated and reproducible workflow for SQS generation that is delivered through an online, interactive interface. SimplySQS guides users through structure import, compositional and supercell definition, and cluster parameter selection, while automatically generates all required ATAT input files and a single all-in-one execution script that encapsulates the complete search process. By standardizing input preparation, execution, and output analysis, the framework minimizes errors associated with manual file handling and enables consistent reproducibility of SQS searches. The workflow is demonstrated on the Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3 (STO)) perovskite system. SQSs spanning the entire concentration range were generated using a single automated bash script produced by SimplySQS, after which all resulting structures were subjected to geometry optimization using a universal machine-learning interatomic potential (MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0). This approach reliably reproduced the experimentally observed cubic-to-tetragonal transition near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic region (x > 0.5) and less than 4 % in the tetragonal region (x < 0.5). Overall, SimplySQS transforms SQS generation with ATAT into intuitive, reproducible, and systematic framework for modeling disordered materials."

However, the dynamics of liquid-lens coalescence have been relatively underexplored, particularly in the case of liquid lenses with larger contact angles. We numerically investigate the coalescence of low-viscosity liquid lenses by means of the pseudopotential multi-component lattice Boltzmann method over a wide range of contact angles. In two-dimensional simulations, our numerical results on the growth of the bridge height are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements for small contact angles. In addition, by comparing our simulation results with a theoretical approach based on the thin-sheet equations for liquid lenses, we find that the thin-sheet equations accurately capture the bridge-growth dynamics up to contact angles of approximately $\\theta < 40^{\\circ}$. For the three-dimensional case, the growth of the bridge radius is independent of the equilibrium contact angle of the liquid lenses at the initial stage of growth. The dependency between the growth of the bridge height and the bridge radius exhibits a non-linear to linear transition."

This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties. These findings shed light on the impact of silicon doping on charge transport in InGaN alloys for optoelectronic applications."

Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation."

      "summary": "Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\\to S^2$), we show that the polar alignment interaction is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics. This constraint naturally generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. These results classify chiral active matter as a dissipative spintronic fluid, revealing that the transition to active turbulence is the emergence of a topological quasiparticle gas, where macroscopic Onsager dipoles acquire effective inertia from the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry."

They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments. We find that the fidelity of braiding operation reaches unity when the current noise is fully suppressed, while this braiding fidelity monotonously decreases with the increasing of the current noise. Based on these transport signatures, we further discuss the correspondence between Majorana and Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, highlighting their similarity in supporting non-Abelian statistics."

Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering."

Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications."

      "summary": "The classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice is important for understanding frustrated magnetic phenomena in materials such as FePS$_3$ and Ba$_2$CoTeO$_6$, where diverse phases (e.g., striped, zigzag, armchair) and magnetization plateaus have been experimentally observed. To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon in frustrated systems. These results clarify the nature of phases and phase transitions in frustrated Ising systems and their exponents, and additionally provide inspiration for experimental efforts to search for the spiral state and specific-heat multipeak phenomenon."

Despite multiple approximated models, a comprehensive and exact dynamical theory for curve-fold origami remains absent, limiting the precise predictions of its dynamics, especially for those with wide panels. In this work, we develop an exact dimension-reduced theory that focuses on the dynamics of curve-fold origami, utilizing the intrinsic one-dimensional nature of developable surfaces. Starting from a single developable surface, we investigate the kinematics and kinetic energy of a moving developable surface. By overcoming the difficulty of describing the motion of local frames, we derive the exact velocity field of wide surfaces solely described by the motion of the reference curve, which leads to the kinetic energy of the entire surface. Owing to the one-dimensional feature, the Lagrangian of the system, composed of both kinetic and elastic energy, is a functional of the reference curve. Thus, we may variate the Lagrangian and derive a nonlinear dynamical theory for the reference curve, which comprises governing equations similar to the rod model but can precisely describe the motion of developable surfaces. The theory is validated consistently in both Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks and is further extended to curved-fold origami modeled as a coupled bi-rod system. Utilizing our exact 1D model, we theoretically analyze the dynamical behaviors of various developable structures, revealing that the coupling of curvature and torsion along with the motion of local frames in our theory leads to the accurate modeling of arbitrarily deformed developable surfaces, which are validated by finite element analysis quantitatively."

In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes."

Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench"

However, recent experimental investigations revealed that the their lubricating capabilities can change with the substrate. The present computational study employs density functional theory calculations to quantify the adhesion energy of both pristine and oxidized phosphorene monolayers on various metallic substrates (aluminum, copper, iron, and chromium) and their corresponding oxides ($\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$, $\\mathrm{Cu_2O}$, $\\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}$, and $\\mathrm{Cr_2O_3}$), correlating these interfacial property with experimentally observed tribological performance. Results demonstrate that oxidized phosphorene presents higher adhesion to all substrates with respect to pristine phosphorene, attributed to favorable interactions between oxygen non-bonding states and substrate empty states. Adhesion is systematically more favorable on pristine metals than on their corresponding oxides, with chromium and iron showing particularly strong interactions due to partially filled 3d orbitals. This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the iron substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer. Charge redistribution correlates with the adhesion and electronic structure analyses reveal system-dependent interfacial bonding characteristics, with some configurations inducing metallic character in phosphorene. These findings provide fundamental insights into substrate-dependent lubricating properties of black phosphorus, highlighting the key role of layer-substrate adhesion."

The hybrid configuration enhances the in-plane electric field and improves the plasmon-induced thermal gradient. Numerical simulations and photoresponse measurements were employed to systematically investigate the influence of a metal reflective layer on the photothermoelectric behavior of the device, which reveals the IEA design significantly boosts the THz absorption rate in graphene nanostructures and promotes asymmetry in the lateral diffusion of hot carriers. Compared with the bare device, the responsivity of the device is enhanced by approximately 30-folds, while maintaining a response time below 130 microseconds.

This can be done in a very elegant way, due to the fact that in our tradable based formulation there appear no drift terms in the PDE. We construct a mixed scheme based on this idea and apply it to price various types of arithmetic Asian options, as well as plain vanilla options (both european and american style) on stocks paying known cash dividends. We find prices which are accurate to $\\sim 0.1%$ in about 10ms on a Pentium 233MHz computer and to $\\sim 0.001%$ in a second.

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Defining an error of measurement has long been a foundational problem in science: even in classical experiments, data are statistical and admit no single universally optimal definition of error. In quantum mechanics, the challenge deepens: observed entities often lack preexisting definite values, and the act of measurement unavoidably disturbs the system of interest. Consequently, both error and disturbance must be quantified, and various definitions have been proposed to date. However, a unified perspective for understanding the differences and similarities among these diverse definitions of error and disturbance, and an operational framework for distinguishing between them, remain elusive. In this Letter, we propose a novel framework for defining error and disturbance using irreversibility. Our framework converts the error and disturbance of a quantum measurement of a system under consideration into the irreversibility of an ancillary qubit system, using a quantum comb composed of loss and recovery processes. The mechanism enables us to make the operational distinction that error uses the classical outputs, while disturbance uses the quantum outputs of the measurement in the recovery process. Furthermore, our framework yields several key consequences: (i) it encompasses existing definitions, (ii) it establishes a universal constraint on error and disturbance defined by any measure of an arbitrary quantum process under a conservation law, and (iii) it reveals an operational connection between irreversibility and the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a metric of quantum chaos. It also provides a constraint on the OTOC under a conservation law and a method for its experimental evaluation, which is demonstrated on a quantum processor."

The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. Numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$."

A key challenge is surpassing the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon (WNS) aliasing limit, establishing a frequency below which the signal cannot be faithfully reconstructed. However, the WNS limit applies only to periodic sampling, opening the door to bypass aliasing by aperiodic sampling. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of a recently discovered family of aperiodic monotile tilings, the Hat family, in overcoming the aliasing limit when spatially sampling a wavefield. By analyzing their spectral properties, we show that monotile aperiodic seismic (MAS) arrays, based on a subset of the Hat tiling family, are efficient in surpassing the WNS sampling limit. Our investigation leads us to propose MAS arrays as a novel design principle for seismic arrays. We show that MAS arrays can outperform regular and other aperiodic arrays in realistic beamforming scenarios using single and distributed sources, including station-position noise. While current seismic arrays optimize beamforming or imaging applications using spiral or regular arrays, MAS arrays can accommodate both, as they share properties with both periodic and aperiodic arrays. More generally, our work suggests that aperiodic monotiles can be an efficient design principle in various fields requiring wave sampling."

Viewing CSS codes as cochain complexes, we observe that cohomology invariants naturally give rise to diagonal logical gates. We show that such invariants exist if the quantum code has a structure that relaxes certain properties of a differential graded algebra. We show how to equip quantum codes with such a structure by defining cup products on CSS codes. The logical gates obtained from this approach can be implemented by a constant-depth unitary circuit. In particular, we construct a $\\Lambda$-fold cup product that can produce a logical operator in the $\\Lambda$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy on $\\Lambda$ copies of the same quantum code, which we call the copy-cup gate. For any desired $\\Lambda$, we can construct several families of quantum codes that support gates in the $\\Lambda$-th level with various asymptotic code parameters."

We make this rigorous in the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. We make use of the supercritical (low-temperature) metastable mixing which was recently proven by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani, and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the ERGM in a large metastable well, answering a question posed by those authors. To achieve this, we prove a new connectivity property for metastable mixing in the ERGM and introduce a new general result yielding concentration inequalities, which extends a result of Chatterjee. We also use a result of Barbour, Brightwell, and Luczak to cover all cases of interest. Our work extends a result of Ganguly and Nam from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to metastable wells, and we also extend applications of this concentration, namely a central limit theorem for small subcollections of edges and a bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM and the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we present a simulation study of metastable wells in the supercritical ERGM."

To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies."

Classical holography of perfect (\\ie non-dissipative) fluids is generally proven, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. A consequence of holographic property is vorticity conservation, which opens the way toward wave-function representation of hydrodynamic equations to obtain the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Another special case of the derived fluid model is Newtonian gravity, when the internal variable is the gravitational potential itself.

We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning.

However, many experiments over the years have consistently revealed counterintuitive charging patterns, including variable impact charge under identical conditions, charge sign reversal with repeated impacts, and bipolar charging of differently sized particles. Existing computational models cannot predict these patterns; they either rely on oversimplified heuristics or require inaccessible detailed surface properties. We present a stochastic scaling model (SSM) for particle charging that unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single theoretical framework. The model grounds in a physics-based stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge measured in a highly-controlled reference experiment. To test the SSM, we implemented it in an open-source Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver. When simulating 300 000 insulating particles transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows, the SSM takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SSM offers a physically grounded route to large-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows."

While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modeled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime."

Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing."

This state is now observed using ultrafast electron diffraction."
