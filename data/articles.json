A key challenge lies in developing theoretically sound models that capture both phase and amplitude dynamics of a given system. This study uses Wirtinger calculus to develop a rigorous mathematical framework with a complex-valued oscillator representation, introducing a real-valued energy function and corresponding dynamics that faithfully represent the system’s behavior. This provides a stronger theoretical foundation and practical design principles for engineering next-generation oscillator-based Ising machines. [Phys. Rev.
