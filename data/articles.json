Here, based on transport and diffraction measurements, and supported by theoretical calculations, the authors demonstrate that the R 5 Pb 3 O ( R =La, Ce) family hosts an electron-phonon coupling-driven CDW at low temperatures. The high-temperature structure contains linear La-Pb chains, and the CDW is associated with the formation of La-Pb pairs within these chains. The presence of a low-temperature CDW transition is suggested by anomalously large thermal ellipses associated with the La atoms in the chains, potentially offering a means of searching for potential CDW compounds.

Thus, removing these nuclear spin-full isotopes is essential to extend the hyperfine-limited coherence times needed to implement robust quantum processors. This work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of device-grade nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures on industrial SiGe buffers while minimizing the amounts of highly purified 70GeH4 and 28SiH4 used. The obtained 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures exhibit a dislocation density of 5.3 x 10e6 cm-2 and an isotopic purity exceeding 99.99%, with carbon and oxygen impurities below the detection sensitivity, as revealed by atom probe tomography. Magnetotransport measurements on gated Hall bars demonstrate effective gate control of hole density in nuclear spin-free quantum wells. Negative threshold gate voltages confirm the absence of intentional doping in the wells, while Hall and Shubnikov-de Haas analyses yield consistent carrier densities (1.4 x 10e11 cm-2) and high mobilities (2.4 x 10e5 cm2/Vs). Mobility trends reveal interfacetrap- limited scattering and percolation concentration below 7 x 10e10 cm-2. These analyses, along with atomic-level studies, confirm the high quality of epitaxial 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures and their relevance as a platform for long-coherence spin qubits."

E 111, 054114 (2025)], wherein a generalized Maxwell Boltzmann distribution was formulated using the Mittag Leffler function within the superstatistical formalism, we extend this approach to the quantum domain. Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD) distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\\alpha), which facilitates a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena."

      "summary": "Digital images from crystals, as projected from the third spatial dimension and recorded in atomic resolution with any kind of real-world microscope, feature necessarily broken symmetries of the translation-periodicity-restricted Euclidean plane. The symmetry breakings are due to both the imaging process and the real structure of the imaged crystal, with the former cause typically dominating. A posterior algorithmic reduction of the symmetry breaking in such images constitutes, thus, often a correction for many of the distortions that were introduced by the imaging processes. Numerically quantified restorations of such symmetries can, therefore, be used to demonstrate the efficacy of a newly implemented posterior correction method for atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals. Recently developed information theory based methods are here shown to be suitable for this purpose. Thirteen experimental atomic-resolution images from graphite and monolayer molybdenite (MoS2), as respectively obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy in the torsional resonance mode, and aberration-corrected parallel illumination transmission electron microscopy served as test cases in our larger (in its totality so far unpublished) study, from which we quote here. The source code of the software that was used for our distortion corrections and the whole report on that study are freely available on GitHub."

We study a Duffing resonator under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives, governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime, where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states. We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting circuit platforms."

We start with two species of fermions $c_i, f_i$, each with $N$ flavors and matrix bosons $b_{ij}$ with $N^2$ components. They interact with each other via slave-boson like interaction $\\int b_{ij}^{\\dagger} \\, c_i^{\\dagger}f_j$. The bosons have a bare dispersion of $\\varepsilon_{\\textbf{q}}^b = \\lambda_z |\\textbf{q}|^z$ and we study the problem in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show that for $d = z+1,$ the electronic self energy shows marginal Fermi liquid behavior. We first evaluate the fermionic self energy $\\Sigma(i\\omega)$ using the standard approximate boson self energy $\\Pi(\\textbf{q}, i\\nu) \\propto |\\nu|/|\\textbf{q}|$ and find that $\\Sigma(i\\omega) \\sim \\omega \\ln(N/|\\omega|)$ which shows a much weaker dependence on $N$ when compared with similar results from non-SYK large-$N$ Ising-nematic models. Then we evaluate $\\Sigma(i\\omega)$ again using a more precise form of $\\Pi$ which allows us to study the interplay between $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ limit for which $\\Sigma(i\\omega) \\sim \\omega \\ln(1/|\\omega|)$, and the $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$ limit where we recover $\\Sigma(i\\omega) \\sim \\omega \\ln(N/|\\omega|)$. We also use the full bosonic self energy to obtain the correction to the bosonic specific heat as $\\frac{T}{N} \\ln(1/T)$. Since there are $N^2$ bosons and $N$ fermions, the bulk heat capacity for both fermions and bosons show nearly similar functional form $NVT \\ln(N/T)$ and $NVT \\ln(1/T)$ respectively for $T \\rightarrow 0$."

Charged and neutral density functional formulations have been developed to address this issue, yet their relationship remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate their equivalence in treating the many-body self-interaction of the polaron state. In particular, we connect with each other piecewise-linear functionals based on adding an extra charge to the supercell, the pSIC approach derived from the energetics of the neutral defect with polaronic distortions in a supercell, and the unit-cell method for polarons based on electron-phonon couplings. We show that these approaches lead to the same formal expression of the self-interaction corrected energy, which is fully defined by the energetics of the neutral charge state of the charged polaronic structure. Residual differences between these methods solely arise from the achieved polaronic structure, which is affected by different treatments of electron-screening and finite-size effects. We apply these methods to a set of prototypical small hole and electron polarons, including the hole polaron in MgO, the hole polaron in $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, the $V_\\text{k}$ center in NaI, the electron polaron in BiVO$_4$, and the electron polaron in TiO$_2$. We show that the ground-state properties of polarons obtained using charged and neutral density functional formulations are in excellent agreement."

Fabrication and characterization of silicon nitride membranes has become a form of tacit knowledge in optomechanics research groups. Here we present a video run-through of the design, fabrication, and characterization of a contemporary silicon nitride membrane resonator (specifically, a centimeter-scale Si3N4 nanoribbon supporting $Q>10^8$ torsion modes). Our tutorial can serve as a starting point or refresher for practitioners in the field."

      "summary": "Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties. Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic devices."

Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control, and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for spintronic and nanofluidic functions."

Large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal incompressible density plateaus at incommensurate fillings tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus feature emergent nonuniform density profiles and robust long-range correlations, as captured by the structure factor. Depending on filling and interaction strength, the system realizes either a quasi-solid phase with suppressed superfluidity, a quasi-supersolid phase where density order coexists with finite superfluid density, or a superfluid phase. Our results demonstrate that purely interaction-induced quasiperiodicity, without external potential or disorder, can stabilize novel quantum phases that simultaneously break translational symmetry and sustain quantum coherence."

      "summary": "In iron-based superconductors, the two Fe atoms in the unit cell are typically related by crystal symmetries; therefore, we expect no intra-unit cell variations in the superconducting gap. However, recent experiments have challenged this expectation, reporting intra-unit cell variations in the gap with an unusual particle-hole asymmetry. Here, we examine the origin of this asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices in monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$. We reveal that, in addition to the substrate-induced broken inversion symmetry, substrate nematic symmetry breaking is key to observing this asymmetry. We further identify two possible mechanisms through which this can occur. The first is through an odd-parity gap function that coexists with an extended $s$-wave function. The second is via a nodeless $d$-wave gap function that develops in the presence of a symmetry-breaking substrate. We argue that the latter mechanism is more physical. To test our theory, we performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements across the nematic domain walls, which exhibit a clear enhancement of the asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices. In addition, we reveal that the observed sublattice particle-hole asymmetry is associated with odd-frequency pairing correlations, providing an experimental realization of this unusual pairing correlation."

      "summary": "In flat band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few geometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we introduce an embedding-independent length scale $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ of a flat band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to the flat band. Because $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in a flat-band superconductor is given by $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling limit, thereby identifying $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results highlight $\\xi_\\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open a pathway to embedding-independent characterization of strongly interacting flat-band materials."

However, there are conflicting conclusions in the literature regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study the core-level and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant photoemission spectroscopy(resonant-PES) to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in the Ni $3d$ states is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge transfer cluster model calculations using the experimentally estimated $U_{dd}$ (= 3.7 eV), and the results show that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative charge-transfer energy ($\\Delta$ = -2.8 eV). The same type of cluster model analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator character, with $U_{dd}$ = 7.0 eV and $\\Delta$ = 6.0 eV. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$ $$|\\Delta|$, the results indicate the important role of a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ in making NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac semi-metal."

This enhancement prompts a critical question: to what extent can quantum wells (QWs) be strained while still preserving the fundamental QSHI phase? In this study, we demonstrate the controlled molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of highly strained-layer QWs with an indium composition of x = 0.5. These structures possess a substantial compressive strain within the In0.5Ga0.5Sb QW. Detailed crystal structure analyses confirm the exceptional quality of the resulting epitaxial films, indicating coherent lattice structures and the absence of visible dislocations. Transport measurements further reveal that the QSHI phase in InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb QWs is robust and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Notably, the edge states in these systems exhibit giant magnetoresistance when subjected to a modest perpendicular magnetic field. This behavior is in agreement with the Z2 topological property predicted by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, confirming the preservation of topologically protected edge transport in the presence of enhanced bulk strain."

      "summary": "The accurate simulation of strongly correlated electron systems remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, motivating the development of various non-perturbative many-body methods. Such methods are typically benchmarked against the numerical exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) in the Hubbard model; however, DQMC is limited by the fermionic sign problem and the uncertainties of numerical analytic continuation. To address these issues, we use the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model as a benchmarking platform to evaluate three many-body approximations: $GW$, $HGW$, and $SGW$. We compare the Green's functions, spectral functions, and response functions obtained from these approximations with the exact solutions. Our analysis shows that the $GW$ approximation, often considered insufficient for describing strong correlation, exhibits a previously unreported solution branch that accurately reproduces Mott physics in the HK model. In addition, using a covariant formalism, we find that $HGW$ provides an accurate description of charge response, while $SGW$ performs well for spin correlations. Overall, our work demonstrates that the HK model can effectively benchmark many-body approximations and helps refine the understanding of $GW$ methods in strongly correlated regimes."

At ambient conditions, Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ crystallizes in the cubic Fm-3m structure, which remains stable below 8.0 GPa. Within this pressure range, subtle inter-octahedral rotations develop, producing a gradual localized deviation from the ideal cubic framework. This local reorientation facilitates radiative recombination, leading to a pronounced enhancement of PL intensity with pressure up to 2.4 GPa. Beyond this pressure point, enhancement of nonradiative relaxation channels result in gradual PL quenching. Additionally, the PL intensity increases upon the application of an external weak magnetic field. A structural transition to the orthorhombic Pnnm phase occurs at around 8.0 GPa, followed by a monoclinic P$2_1/m$ phase above 10.7 GPa, and eventual amorphization beyond 25.5 GPa. Optical absorption spectra reveal continuous band-gap narrowing upon compression. These findings demonstrate the strong coupling among lattice dynamics, electronic structure, and optical response in Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$, underscoring its potential as a pressure-tunable optoelectronic material"

Recent advances have identified the antisymmetric PHE (under magnetic field reversal) as an intriguing extension in magnetic systems. While new mechanisms have been proposed, the role of conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we report the experimental discovery of an antisymmetric (with respect to both magnetic field and magnetization) PHE and magnetoresistance in single-crystal $Co_{30}Pt_{70}$ (111) thin films with $C_{3}$ rotational symmetry and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). We demonstrate that both antisymmetric effects arise naturally from the intrinsic fourth-rank AMR tensor inherent to C3-symmetric planes, assisted by PMA. Our findings link conventional AMR to antisymmetric galvanomagnetic responses, offering new insights into symmetry-governed transport in crystalline ferromagnets."

      "summary": "Topological order characterizes a class of quantum and classical many-body liquid states that escape the conventional classification by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Many properties of the topological-ordered states still await a clear understanding, and nature of phase transition dynamics is one of them. Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with nucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding nucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal that the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a fundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by a global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call a flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a triangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the phase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is required to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the topological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must spend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the system, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of triplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually small Avrami exponent $\\sim0.5$. These anomalous dynamics are specific to the crystallization from topological-ordered liquid, and well account for the main features of charge glass behavior exhibited by the organic conductors, $\\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X(SCN)$_4$."

      "summary": "Strain engineering is a powerful strategy for tuning the optoelectronic properties in two-dimensional materials, yet the underlying mechanisms governing their strain response are often not fully elucidated. In this work, our first-principle calculations show that the penta-orthorhombic PdS$_2$ monolayer exhibits two key strain-tunable properties: a continuous redshift of its main optical absorption peak from $\\sim$2.0 to $\\sim$1.6~eV and enhancement in carrier mobility, with a more than threefold increase for electron under 0--4\\% biaxial tensile strain. Subsequent analysis reveals that the tunable optical response originates from a robust band nesting feature between the highest valence and lowest conduction bands, which is preserved across the Brillouin zone under biaxial strain. For the carrier transport, deformation potential theory predicts mobility increasing with strain, strongly correlating with the reduction of carrier effective mass. Our first-principles calculations show a strain-induced monotonic decrease in carrier linewidths near the band edges, indicating suppressed carrier-phonon scattering and longer carrier lifetime as the origin of the mobility enhancement. Our work establishes a pathway for engineering the optoelectronic response in 2D semiconductors where strong band nesting governs the optical properties and paves the way for the rational design of continuously tunable flexible optoelectronic devices."

      "summary": "Orbital currents provide a new degree of freedom for controlling magnetism, yet their interaction with lattice dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we report a systematic investigation of the acoustic orbital Hall effect in light metals such as Ti and Cr, where surface acoustic waves generate orbital currents through phonon-orbital coupling. The acoustic orbital current in Ti exhibits higher efficiency and longer diffusion length compared to the acoustic spin current in Pt. The sign and magnitude of the rectified acoustic voltages in nonmagnetic (Ti, Cr)/ferromagnetic (Ni, Co, Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$) bilayers are determined by the product of orbital-to-spin conversion and magnetoelastic coupling efficiencies of the ferromagnet. Additionally, we find evidence for acoustic orbital pumping, whereby the excitation of ferromagnetic resonance by surface acoustic waves injects an orbital current from the ferromagnet into the nonmagnet. These results establish lattice dynamics as an efficient driver of orbital transport, opening opportunities for low-dissipation orbitronic devices that harness and sense phonons."

      "summary": "Quantum droplets (QDs), formed by ultra-dilute quantum fluids under the action of Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) effect, provide a unique platform for investigating a wide range of macroscopic quantum effects. Recent studies of QDs' breathing modes and collisional dynamics have revealed their compressibility and extensibility, which suggests that their elasticity parameters can be identified. In this work, we derive the elastic bulk modulus (BM) of QDs by means of the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, and establish a relation between the BM and the eigenfrequency of QD's intrinsic vibrations. The analysis reveals the dependence of the QD's elasticity on the particle number and the strength of interparticle interactions. We conclude that the BM of QDs can be less than $1~\\mathrm{\\mu Pa}$, implying that QDs are ultra-soft quantum elastic media. These findings suggest new perspectives for realizing elastic media governed by the LHY effect."

      "summary": "Place-cell networks, typically forced to pairwise synaptic interactions, are widely studied as models of cognitive maps: such models, however, share a severely limited storage capacity, scaling linearly with network size and with a very small critical storage. This limitation is a challenge for navigation in 3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a one-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns (interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 3-dimensional space -yet preserving the same resolution- requires roughly $O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards, dense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate memory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly recognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so far. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a layer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for the internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the MEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with pairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense Battaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body interactions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -analytically- that such effective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological plausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors; furthermore, we prove -numerically- that the present neural network is capable of recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional space."

      "summary": "The interplay between topological materials and local symmetry breaking gives rise to diverse topological quantum phenomena. A notable example is the parity anomalous semimetal (PAS), which hosts a single unpaired gapless Dirac cone with a half-integer quantized Hall conductivity. Here, we realize this phase in a magnetic topological sandwich structure by applying an in-plane magnetic field. This configuration aligns the magnetization of one surface in-plane while preserving magnetization out-of-plane on the opposite surface, satisfying the condition for a gapless surface state near the Fermi level on only one surface. Our key evidence is a distinctive two-stage evolution of the conductivity tensor ($\\sigma_{xy}$, $\\sigma_{xx}$). The first stage culminates in the PAS at the fixed point ($\\frac{e^2}{2h}$, $m \\frac{e^2}{h}$), where $m \\approx 0.6$ corresponds to the minimal longitudinal conductivity of a single gapless Dirac cone of fermions on a 2D lattice. This PAS state remains stabilized and is superposed with a gapped band flow in the second stage. This observation demonstrates that this state stabilized by the in-plane field resists localization--contrary to conventional expectations for 2D electron systems with broken time reversal symmetry. The dynamic transition from an integer quantized insulator to a half-integer quantized semimetal establishes this material system as a versatile platform for exploring parity anomaly physics."

      "summary": "Recently, altermagnets have emerged as promising candidates in spintronics, uniquely combining large spin-polarized electronic states with zero net magnetization. A prominent example is $\\alpha$-MnTe, whose altermagnetic spin splitting, i.e., the degeneracy lift in momentum space induced by collinear magnetic order, has been experimentally observed. However, the direct evidence of its $g$-wave spin polarization, the key property for altermagnetic spintronics, is thus far lacking. By combining high-resolution spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) with first-principles calculations, we reveal a $k_z$-independent, Rashba-like spin texture in $\\alpha$-MnTe. Our results indicate that the observed spin polarization is primarily governed by spin-orbit coupling, whereas the magnetic order contributes to the splitting of energy bands but plays a much less dominant role in spin polarization due to the multi-domain nature. From this result, we further establish a way to prescreen altermagnet candidates that favor the formation of large antiferromagnetic domains based on symmetry analysis. Our work elucidates the interplay between magnetic order and spin-orbit coupling in governing spin polarization in altermagnet candidates, and thereby advances the materials design paradigm for spin-functional devices."

Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta."

      "summary": "The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic \\ce{FeCl2} monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials."

      "summary": "Among the variety of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers, or B centers, have gathered a particular interest owing to their excellent quantum optical properties. Moreover, the fact that they can be locally activated by an electron beam makes them suitable for top-down integration in photonic devices. However, in the absence of a real-time monitoring technique sensitive to individual emitters, the activation process is stochastic in the number of emitters, and its mechanism is under debate. Here, we implement an in-situ cathodoluminescence monitoring setup capable of detecting individual quantum emitters in the blue and ultraviolet (UV) range. We demonstrate that the activation of individual B centers is spatially and temporally correlated with the deactivation of individual UV centers emitting at 4.1 eV, which are ubiquitous in hBN. We then make use of the ability to detect individual B center activation events to demonstrate the controlled creation of an array with only one emitter per irradiation site. Additionally, we demonstrate a symmetric technique for heralded selective deactivation of individual emitters. Our results provide insights into the microscopic structure and activation mechanism of B centers, as well as versatile techniques for their deterministic integration."

      "summary": "To elucidate the photon detection mechanism of superconducting single-photon detectors, we theoretically examine the dynamics of type-II superconductors with a bias current using the two-dimensional time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau and the Maxwell equations. The photon injection that weakens the superconducting order parameter is treated phenomenologically as a local temperature increase, and the amount of injection is controlled by the initial hotspot radius. The photon is detected by the voltage change between two electrodes attached to the left and right edges of the superconductor. We find that certain parameter ranges can be explained by the traditionally considered hotspot model, while other parameter ranges are governed by the generation and annihilation of superconducting vortex and antivortex pairs. The photon detection is possible for an initial hotspot radius that exceeds a threshold value. We find that the generation of a vortex--antivortex pair occurs near the threshold. The flow of the pair perpendicular to the current direction finally creates a normal region for the photon detection. The voltage change for the Ginzburg--Landau parameter close to the transition point from type-II to type-I superconductor shows anomalous behavior that is not associated with the dynamics of the vortex--antivortex pair. We also examine the effects of spatially non-uniform current density on the voltage change and the superconducting order parameter to provide a hint to understand the behavior of wide-strip single-photon detectors. The estimated values of incident photon energy and response time for photon detection are reasonable in comparison with experiments. The present comprehensive examination provides useful guidelines for flexible design of device structures."

      "summary": "Microorganisms often encounter strong confinement and complex hydrodynamic flows while navigating their habitats. Combining finite-element methods and stochastic simulations, we study the interplay of active transport and heterogeneous flows in dense porous channels. We find that swimming always slows down the traversal of agents across the channel, giving rise to robust power-law tails of their exit-time distributions. These exit-time distributions collapse onto a universal master curve with a scaling exponent of $\\approx 3/2$ across a wide range of packing fractions and motility parameters, which can be rationalized by a scaling relation. We further identify a new motility pattern where agents alternate between surfing along fast streams and extended trapping phases, the latter determining the power-law exponent. Unexpectedly, trapping occurs in the flow backbone itself -- not only at obstacle boundaries -- due to vorticity-induced reorientation in the highly-heterogeneous fluid environment. These findings provide a fundamentally new active transport mechanism with direct implications for biofilm clogging and the design of novel microrobots capable of operating in heterogeneous media."

Previous studies investigated the cases of distributed defects on the array, and defects at the level of single fibrils. However, the influence of localized, macroscopic defects remains largely unexplored. Using numerical simulations of a discrete mechanical model for a fibrillar adhesive with a thick backing layer, we investigate how the size and location of a single circular defect affect the established scaling law between the adhesion force ($F$) and the effective compliance of the system ($\\beta$), \\ie, $F \\propto \\beta^{-1/2}$. We find that edge defects are generally more detrimental than central ones, as they act as pre-cracks that amplify stress concentrations at the adhesive's edge, accelerating a crack-like failure. Consequently, the established adhesion scaling law is preserved, with the defect only reducing the effective contact area. In contrast, a central defect fundamentally alters the mechanics of detachment. By transforming the contact geometry into an annulus, it promotes more uniform load sharing across the remaining fibrils and mitigates the edge-dominated failure mechanism. This change makes the adhesive strength less sensitive to the compliance of the system, as reflected by a less negative scaling exponent. The transition between these two regimes appears to occur for defects whose boundary merges with the one of the adhesive. These results provide practical guidance for the design, engineering and quality control of bio-inspired fibrillar adhesives."

Since ferromagnetic insulators are emerging as an important platform for lossless spintronics, we consider the $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$ ($RE$ : rare-earth) family and investigate single-crystalline films of (La$_{0.4}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sm$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.4}$Y$_{0.4}$)NiMnO$_{6}$ grown on SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates in this work. Despite configurational disorder and high cationic size variance at the $RE$ site, the material exhibits robust ferromagnetic ordering with a Curie temperature ($T_\\mathrm{c}$) of approximately 150 K. This $T_\\mathrm{c}$ is consistent with the expectation based on consideration of the average ionic radii of the rare-earth ($RE$) sites in the bulk $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$. Below $T_\\mathrm{c}$, Raman spectroscopy measurement finds a deviation from anharmonic behavior, where the phonon renormalization aligns with a mean-field approximation of spin-spin correlation. At lower temperature, magnetic $RE$ ions also contributed to the magnetic behavior and the system displays a reentrant spin-glass-like behavior. This study demonstrates that while a mean-field approach serves as a viable starting point for predicting the long-range transition temperature, microscopic details of the complex magnetic interactions are essential for understanding the low-temperature phase."

These dynamics include self-organized bursts and glassy behavior at intermediate densities--phenomena not apparent from ensemble-averaged steady-state measures. By analyzing quantities like the overlap order parameter, we observe that the system exhibits dynamical slowing down as particle density increases. This slowdown is also reflected in the bursting activity, where both the amplitude and frequency of bursts decrease with increasing particle density. A minimal inertial active-particle model reproduces these dynamical steady states, revealing the importance of a new intermediate length scale--larger than the particle size. This intermediate scale is critical for the formation of structures resembling caging and plays a key role in the glass-like transition. Our results describe a macroscopic analog of an active glass with the additional phenomena of bursting."

The underlying nonsymmorphic crystal structure in the low-temperature orthogonal phase endows the lattice with a sublattice structure that gives rise to two electronic bands near the Fermi surface. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the hybridization of these two bands generates small Fermi pockets and, correspondingly, a change in the number of free carriers. A sublattice structure also leads to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) matrix-element interference, naturally explaining the emergence of Fermi arcs and their consistency with closed Fermi pockets. We employ a symmetry analysis to highlight the expected Fermi surface properties, and complement it with density functional theory (DFT) for a quantitative discussion and comparison with recent experiments in doped La$_2$CuO$_4$. The proposed mechanism can consistently account for the most salient features of the pseudogap in the cuprates, namely, the Fermi surface reconstruction with the formation of small Fermi pockets and the corresponding change in carrier density, and the observation of Fermi arcs by ARPES."

      "summary": "We investigate non-equilibrium pattern formation in an antiparallel two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate by varying the polarization angle and the trap aspect ratio. At finite tilt, the condensate supports stripe order. Quenching the angle to zero triggers a roton-assisted, mushroom-like corrugation that destroys translational order and drives the system into labyrinthine textures, whereas a slow linear ramp produces long-lived curved stripes that ultimately converge to labyrinths. Population imbalance strongly biases the evolution: the minority component preferentially fragments into a stable droplet array while the majority remains comparatively diffuse; once formed, the droplet crystal is robust under polarization hysteresis with largely reversible shape changes and unchanged lattice topology. The trap aspect ratio controls both the initial stripe number and the instability timescale, with tighter axial confinement accelerating corrugation and yielding denser labyrinths at late times. All behaviors arise within a quasi-two-dimensional mean-field regime where beyond-mean-field corrections are negligible; accordingly, the droplets reported here are not self-bound in free space. The observed textures (such as stripes, curved stripes, and labyrinths) mirror the taxonomy and instability pathways of nuclear \"pasta\" morphologies (rods and slabs) known from neutron-star and supernova matter, highlighting polarization angle, trap geometry, and population imbalance as practical, experimentally accessible controls for selecting and steering patterns in dipolar mixtures."

Inspired by Haldane's exclusion statistics, this formulation introduces a modified occupation weight function that encodes effective statistical interactions via the parameter $\\alpha$. Using thermodynamic geometry, we analyze the sign and singular behavior of the thermodynamic curvature as a diagnostic of underlying interactions and phase structures. A crossover temperature $T^{*}$, at which the curvature changes sign, marks the transition between effectively attractive (Bose-like) and repulsive (Fermi-like) statistical regimes. When expressed relative to the Bose--Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$, the ratio $T^{*}/T_{c}$ depends universally on $\\alpha$. For negative $\\alpha$, corresponding to hyperbosonic statistics, we find curvature singularities at specific fugacities, indicating modified condensation phenomena distinct from conventional Bose condensation. These results highlight the geometric and thermodynamic consequences of alpha statistics and establish a link between fractional exclusion principles and curvature-induced interaction signatures in statistical thermodynamics."

In nanostructures, spatial confinement can lead to significant surface scattering, lowering mobility and breaking the spatial homogeneity assumption of conventional models. In this work, a fully ab initio framework based on the spatially dependent Boltzmann transport equation for one-dimensional nanowires is developed. We apply it to Si and GaN assuming diffusive surface scattering, and reveal the mobility-diameter relation: $\\mu_\\mathrm{1D} = \\mu_\\mathrm{bulk} \\left[1-\\left(d/d_0\\right)^{-\\beta}\\right]$. The parameter $d_0$, comparable to the carrier mean free path, defines a boundary layer exhibiting a considerable mobility gradient, and also quantifies the competition between e-ph and surface scattering together with $\\beta$. We further discuss the effects of orientation, cross-sectional shape, and temperature. Moreover, experimental data are generally lower than our predictions, possibly due to structural imperfections, systematic errors from measurements, etc. Therefore, our theoretical method can provide an intrinsic benchmark toward optimized experimental realizations."

Their role in active, living matter, however, remains entirely unexplored. Here we address this gap by introducing and analyzing LPs in the Active Malthusian Ising Model (AMIM) -- a minimal model of living matter that incorporates motility together with birth-death dynamics. Despite its simplicity, the AMIM provides direct experimental relevance. We show that the system generically exhibits two distinct LPs and elucidate their universal behavior using a dynamic renormalization group analysis with the $\\epsilon$-expansion method at one loop. Our results yield testable predictions for future simulations and experiments, establishing LPs as a fertile testing ground for novel physics in active matter."

The ratios of voltage-driven electric/heat noise to the applied voltage $V$ exhibit oscillations with the gate voltage $N$, resembling the behavior of the thermoelectric coefficient $G_T$. In contrast, the ratios of temperature-driven electric/heat noise to the temperature difference $\\Delta T$ vary with $N$ in a manner analogous to the thermal coefficient $G_H$ or the electric conductance $G$. The mixed noise, which is defined as the correlation function between electric and heat currents, displays behavior opposite to that of the above noises. The logarithmic temperature dependence of these noises signals non-Fermi-liquid behavior, while their oscillations with gate voltage reflect the roles of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric transport. Our results demonstrate that the fundamental relations linking voltage- and temperature-induced noises to thermoelectric transport across a tunnel junction persist beyond the Fermi-liquid paradigm."

      "summary": "Sulfur-doped black phosphorus (b-P) has recently emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic technologies owing to its enhanced environmental stability and tunable electronic properties. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of sulfur substitution on the elastic, mechanical, and electronic properties of b-P, with a particular focus on its auxetic behavior (that is, negative Poisson's ratio), using first-principles density functional theory calculations. Our results unveil the fundamental origin of the intrinsic auxetic response in pristine b-P and elucidate how sulfur incorporation alters this behavior. We find that sulfur atoms distort the characteristic bow-tie structural motif responsible for the negative Poisson's ratio in b-P, thereby suppressing the in-plane auxeticity. Moreover, the resulting charge redistribution also effectively quenches the out-of-plane auxetic response of b-P. With increasing sulfur content, the bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio increase, whereas the Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Debye temperature decrease. Additionally, sulfur substitution suppresses the semiconducting properties of b-P, giving rise to metallicity. These findings highlight that although sulfur substitution enhances the environmental stability of b-P, it also substantially modifies its elastic and mechanical properties, particularly the auxetic behavior, which is an important consideration in the design of nanoscale electronic devices."

Atom Probe Tomography (APT) offers unique capabilities for nanoscale chemical analysis and 3D atomic reconstruction but presents challenges for insulating materials such as CePO4, particularly due to oxygen loss during field evaporation. This study investigates the effects of laser wavelength, energy, metallic coatings and detection device on mass spectrum optimization and compositional accuracy in synthetic CePO4 samples. Results show that shorter laser wavelengths (260 nm) enhance peak resolution, particularly when combined with advanced reflectron configurations, as demonstrated with the LEAP 6000 XR. Chromium coatings further improve thermal dissipation and reduce noise levels. However, compositional measurements reveal systematic underestimation of oxygen and overestimation of P and Ce, likely influenced by preferential low-field element evaporation. These findings highlight the need to carefully tune experimental parameters to mitigate quantification biases and enhance the reliability of APT analyses for geological materials."

Further, in transition metal compounds, d-d electronic transitions, arising from excitations between crystal-field split d-orbitals, significantly influence the optical and magnetic properties, particularly in strongly correlated and low-dimensional systems. Fe2P2S6, a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor, offers a rich platform for studying the interplay between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in these 2D systems. In this work, we investigate the photoluminescence (PL) properties of Fe2P2S6 to probe the exciton dynamics, intra-atomic transitions, and their temperature evolution. Two prominent d-d emission peaks are observed at ~ 1.63 eV (D1) and ~ 1.80 eV (D2), attributed to the crystal field-split Fe2+ states. An excitonic emission near the band edge is also identified, which exhibits a characteristic Fano asymmetric line shape. This asymmetry is attributed to the quantum interference between the discrete excitonic state and the d-d transition induced continuum (D2), revealing a Fano resonance behaviour. This exciton peak disappears well before the Neel temperature, indicating its faster destabilization than magnetic ordering. Temperature-dependent PL measurements show a quenching of the excitonic peak with increasing temperature. Our findings provide detailed insight into the optical excitation pathways in Fe2P2S6."

Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems."

Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and superabsorbing quantum devices."

      "summary": "Bandgap engineering in semiconductors is required for the development of photonic and optoelectronic devices with optimized absorption and emission energies. This is usually achieved by changing the chemical or structural composition during growth or by dynamically applying strain. Here, the bandgap in GaAsN nanowires grown on Si is increased post-growth by up to 460 meV in a reversible, tunable, and non-destructive manner through H implantation. Such a bandgap tunability is unattained in epilayers and enabled by relaxed strain requirements in nanowire heterostructures, which enables N concentrations of up to 4.2% in core-shell GaAs/GaAsN/GaAs nanowires resulting in a GaAsN bandgap as low as 0.97 eV. Using micro-photoluminescence measurements on individual nanowires, it is shown that the high bandgap energy of GaAs at 1.42 eV is restored by hydrogenation through formation of N-H complexes. By carefully optimizing the hydrogenation conditions, the photoluminescence efficiency increases by an order of magnitude. Moreover, by controlled thermal annealing, the large shift of the bandgap is not only made reversible, but also continuously tuned by breaking up N-H complexes in the hydrogenated GaAsN. Finally, local bandgap tuning by laser annealing is demonstrated, opening up new possibilities for developing novel, locally and energy-controlled quantum structures in GaAsN nanowires."

      "summary": "We investigate the two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in which the electron hopping amplitude is modulated by the difference between neighboring phonon coordinates. Using sign-problem-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis, we determine the long-range ordered phases as a function of the electron-phonon coupling and phonon frequency. By examining both adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, we reveal the emergence of staggered and armchair valence bond solid (VBS) phases, as well as the O(4) antiferromagnetic phase. In addition, finite-temperature simulations show that the VBS transition occurs at critical temperatures significantly higher than in models with local electron-phonon coupling, consistent with the presence of lighter polarons in the metallic regime. These findings establish the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the optical SSH model, which emphasize its similarities and contrasts with other electron-phonon systems."

Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics."

This challenge is acute for global models that use Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To address this, we introduce \\textit{$\\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water, and benzene-Na$^+$, \\mbox{$\\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to \\textbf{75\\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics simulations further confirm that the $\\Delta$-model yields a reliable force field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses stability above $\\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs."

The system combines: (1) a joint electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, (2) easy-to-use large-object data storage, (3) automatic metadata extraction from heterogeneous and proprietary file formats, (4) interactive provenance graphs for data exploration and reuse, and (5) automated reporting and analysis workflows. The two key technological elements are the openBIS electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, and a newly developed companion application that extends openBIS with large-scale data handling, automated metadata capture, and federated access to distributed research data. This integrated approach reduces friction in data capture and curation, enabling traceable and reusable datasets that accelerate the construction of defect phase diagrams across institutions."

Conventional machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features. However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly deployable in crystalline porous materials."

In this context, the edge irregularity strength concept provides a systematic way of assigning numerical labels to atoms based on specific rules. In this work, we explore the chemical applicability of the edge irregularity strength and demonstrate that it can also serve as a predictive tool for physicochemical properties, similar to topological indices. The findings show that the edge irregularity strength captures molecular features and complements existing approaches to structure-property analysis in chemical graph theory."

We construct the intrinsic NISPT phases by performing discrete gauging in a partial SSB phase with a fusion category symmetry that has a certain mixed anomaly. Sometimes, the anomaly of that symmetry category can be alternatively understood as a self-anomaly of a proper categorical sub-symmetry; when this is the case, the same gauging provides an anomaly resolution of this anomalous categorical sub-symmetry. This allows us to construct intrinsic gapless SPT (igSPT) phases, where the anomalous faithfully acting symmetry is non-invertible; and we refer to such igSPT phases as igNISPT phases. We provide two concrete lattice models realizing an intrinsic NISPT phase and an igNISPT phase, respectively. We also generalize the construction of intrinsic NISPT phases to (3+1)-dim."

At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories."

Over a thousand gradient-flow conditions are found, all of which are scheme-independent and satisfied whenever the full set of results needed to check them is available. It is shown, in the framework of the $\\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion, that the space of conformal field theories (CFTs) is dominated by those with non-zero beta shift as the number of fields grows.

In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local \"decoders\" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models, stability of data distributions implies the existence of computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics."

We prove that any finite-order truncation of the NAPT preserves the normalisation of the conditional electronic factor as well as the gauge covariance of the resulting perturbative equations of motion. We illustrate the usefulness of NAPT by obtaining nonadiabatic corrections to the BO Berry phase in Jahn--Teller systems with a conical intersection. It well captures the departure of the exact Berry phase from being topological via the lowest-order NAPT. By removing the conical intersection with a constant gap, it further yields the correct scaling of the Berry phase toward zero."

We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis.

Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\\'s Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors.

In this work, we extend the measurable film-thickness range of reflectometry to at least 50 um through a new model-free algorithm, the Linearized Reflectance Zero-Crossing (LRZ) method. The approach builds upon the previously reported Linearized Reflectance Extrema (LRE) technique but eliminates the sensitivity to spectral sampling and fringe attenuation that degrade performance in the thick-film regime. By linearizing phase response and extracting zero-crossing positions in wavenumber space, LRZ provides robust and repeatable thickness estimation without iterative fitting, achieving comparable accuracy with much higher computational efficiency than conventional model-based methods. Validation using more than 80 measurements on alumina films over NiFe substrates shows excellent correlation with WLI (r = 0.97) and low gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&amp;R < 3%). Moreover, LRZ achieves an average Move-Acquire-Measure (MAM) time of approximately 2 s, which is about 7 times faster than WLI. The proposed method enables fast, accurate, and model-independent optical metrology for thick films, offering a practical solution for advanced HVM process control."

Graphene, with its c-axis orientation and well-defined interlayer spacing, exhibits electron interference effects that can influence the properties of emitted electrons. In this work, motion of an electron wave packet is numerically calculated to discuss the energy spread of the zero-order and first-order diffracted electron waves by mono- and multilayer graphene. It is found that the effects of multiple reflections of electron between the layers broaden the energy spread especially for the incident energy of 13.4 eV, and that highly monochromatic electron emission can be achieved by using diffracted electron wave with a small aperture."

      "summary": "Ultrafast all-optical magnetization switching (AOS) holds great promise for nextgeneration spintronic memory and hybrid spintronic-photonic systems. However, most implementations to date rely on bulky free-space optical setups, limiting scalability and practical integration. As a critical step toward integrated applications, we demonstrate single-pulse AOS within a silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuit. Using trains of femtosecond laser pulses guided through on-chip waveguides, we achieve deterministic toggle switching in a sub-micron out-of-plane Co/Gd Hall cross patterned directly atop the photonic waveguide. Electrical readout via the anomalous Hall effect reveals a switching contrast of up to 90% for 500 nm-wide devices. In larger Hall crosses, the contrast decreases and switching becomes stochastic, consistent with spatially non-uniform optical absorption as confirmed by finite-element simulations. This behavior is hypothetically attributed to domain wall relaxation and thermally assisted (de)pinning processes within partially switched regions. Our results highlight the critical role of device scaling in achieving robust on-chip AOS and establish a foundation for ultrafast, energy-efficient, and fully integrated spintronic-photonic platforms."

We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar (C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier ($\\approx 150$\\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\\mathrm{sp}$ center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\\alpha$ rotation) that enforces an $\\approx 50\\%:\\,50\\%$ $\\mathrm{C}_s/\\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\\delta$ rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor, providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and achieving conformational control in molecular electronics."

The impact of inter-qubit interactions on the performance of the quantum battery is investigated. In the second model, a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath serves as a collective quantum battery, where the impact of inter-atomic distance and the bath temperature on the battery's performance is explored. Furthermore, a two-qubit model is used, where one qubit is modeled as a battery and the other as a charger. The charger in this model interacts with an anisotropic spin-chain bath, which is conducive to quantum criticality. It is demonstrated that this criticality has a substantial impact on the quantum battery's storage capacity."

Our results show that different DFAs yield similar electron densities, despite differences in their KS potentials, which originate primarily from the exchange and correlation contribution. We also find that the KS gap from the QMC density is typically larger than the KS gaps of most DFAs, with the exception of Hartree-Fock. Finally, the KS gap is sensitive to the inclusion of semicore states in the pseudopotentials, such that comparison with experiment should be done with caution."

Our focus here is on the contribution of the nearest particle neighbors to the total Newtonian force.

      "summary": "Monodisperse, purely repulsive, hard spheres (MPRHS) are an important model system for mechanistically exploring phase behavior in atomic systems and colloids. Since the 1940s, phase transitions in these systems have been obtained via simulation, theory, and experiments. But there is a gap in this literature: despite decades of reports of phase transition from one pure state to another, no computational studies report spontaneous phase separation into coexisting domains of liquid and crystal regions. This gap owes its origin to the underlying mechanism of entropically-driven phase separation in MPRHS - the competition between short-range entropy and long-range entropy. Frenkel proposed that spontaneous phase separation in simulations of up to 1,000,000 particles would require more than 317,000,000 years to sample enough microstates to converge to phase separated macrostate. Some brute-force simulations do show brief spontaneous coexistence but a metastable crystal or fluid subsequently overtakes the system. To bypass these difficulties, many studies use seeding, gravity, or direct construction of liquid and solid phases to study interfacial energy and nucleation rates of MPRHS systems. WCA potentials have also been used to bypass metastability, where softness provides free volume, lowers osmotic pressure and the energy barrier. It is argued that the transition path taken in bypassing metastability is mechanistically the same as without triggers. But as acknowledged by Alder & Wainwright, explicit observation of spontaneous coexistence is central to computational prediction of first-order transition. Such observation would provide satisfying demonstration of Frenkel's entropy exchange mechanism. We explore literature revealing these interesting behaviors and conclude that computational demonstration of Frenkel's mechanism for MPRHS awaits large systems with careful hardness perturbations."

Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets."

Using numerical simulations based on the Thiele-Langevin equation, we demonstrate that the skyrmion motion cannot be fully described by the master equation, highlighting the system's simplicity with its nontrivial dynamics. Particularly, due to the chiral motion of skyrmion, we find asymmetric flow of information even in equilibrium, which is demonstrated by the violation of the detailed balance condition. We analyze this novel system using information-theoretical quantities including Shannon entropy, mutual information, and transfer entropy. By the analyses, the physical significance of transfer entropy as a measure of flow of information, which has been overlooked in previous studies, is elucidated. Notably, the peak position of the transfer entropy, as a function of time delay, is found to be independent of the interaction range between the two skyrmions yet dependent on the box size. This peak corresponds to the characteristic time required for changing the skyrmion state: the box size divided by the average velocity of skyrmions. We can understand that the information transmission time consists of the time to obtain mutual information and the time to write the information. Since the unusual asymmetric circulation of information is revealed in this two-skyrmion system, it can be a unique platform for future applications to natural computing using flow of information, including more efficient machine learning algorithm."

The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices."

The result of any diagram can be written as a linear combination of these computation kernel elements with coefficients given by a sum over products of known tensor elements that are themselves problem specific and represent spatial degrees of freedom. We probe the efficacy of this approach by generating the computation kernel for a low order self-energy diagram which we then use to construct solutions to distinct problems."

      "summary": "Despite progress in HfO2 thin-film ferroelectrics, issues like high coercive fields persist, and the dynamics of twisted ferroelectricity remain largely unexplored. Here, we explore how sliding and twisting in bilayer HfO2 enables low barrier switching. Among 144 sliding configurations, two exhibit strong in-plane polarization (2360 pC/m) with a low switching barrier of 9.57 meV/f.u. Twisting generates polar textures associated with moir\\'e patterns, which drive ferroelectricity via a soft zone-center mode, as revealed by machine-learning-assisted first-principles calculations. The in-plane (out-of-plane) polarization values for HfO2 at twist angles of 21.79{\\deg}, 27.80{\\deg}, and 46.83{\\deg} are 430 (5.82), 367 (2.20), and 1057 (0.03) pC/m, respectively. For 21.79{\\deg} and 27.80{\\deg} twisting, switching barriers drop to 1.74 and 0.18 meV/f.u., indicating superlubric-like transitions. Notably, the 46.83{\\deg} twisted bilayer shows an almost barrier-free polar evolution (0.03 meV /f.u.), attributed to sharply enhanced zone-center phonon linewidths. Our findings establish a moir\\'e-engineered switching route for 2D ferroelectrics."

      "summary": "The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the B\\\"uttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments."

To address the current thirsty for long-lived excitons with zero-external-field stability and room-temperature spin-polarization, we hereby predict the existence of intrinsically SML excitons in altermagnetic V$_2 X_2$O ($X=$ S, Se) driven by giant non-relativistic spin-splittings ($>$ 1.2 eV). First-principles calculations reveal SML excitons with binding energies exceeding 1400 meV in monolayers and 430 meV in their van der Waals heterobilayers, along with stacking-dependent optical selection rules for tunable interlayer excitons. These remarkable physical properties, combined with their long radiative lifetimes, strongly suggest the feasibility of SML excitons with robust spin-polarization at room temperature. Our work provides a new paradigm for SML exciton physics via the novel altermagnetism, opening up new possibilities for all-optical manipulation in advanced opto-spintronics."

Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models.

For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids."

Here, we provide the exact solution of site percolation in a model for strongly clustered random graphs, with many overlapping loops and heterogeneous degree distribution. We systematically compare the exact solution with heterogeneous mean-field predictions obtained from a treelike random rewiring of the network, which preserves only the degree sequence. Our results demonstrate a nontrivial interplay between degree heterogeneity, correlations and network topology, which can significantly alter both the percolation threshold and the critical exponents predicted by the heterogeneous mean-field. These findings reveal limitations of heterogeneous mean-field theory, demonstrating that the degree distribution alone is insufficient to determine universality classes in complex networks with realistic structural features."

The resulting forces on the vortices include both longitudinal and transverse components, leading to deflection and shrinking of the dipole during propagation. For moderate polarization, vortex dipoles are deflected and lose energy, while for larger imbalances, they are rapidly annihilated. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spin-imbalanced Fermi gases contain a spatially nonuniform normal component even at zero temperature. We show that vortex dipoles serve as sensitive probes of this component, offering a route to indirectly detect exotic superfluid phases such as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and related inhomogeneous condensates."

      "summary": "Correlated electron physics is intrinsically a multiscale problem, since high-energy electronic states screen the interactions between the correlated electrons close to the Fermi level, thereby reducing the magnitude of the interaction strength and dramatically shortening its range. Thus, the handling of screening is an essential ingredient in the first-principles modelling of correlated electron systems. Screening is an intrinsically dynamic process and the corresponding downfolding methods such as the constrained Random Phase Approximation indeed produce a dynamic interaction. However, many low-energy methods require an instantaneous interaction as input, which makes it necessary to map the fully dynamic interaction to an effective instantaneous interaction strength. It is a priori not clear if and when such an effective model can capture the physics of the one with dynamic interaction and how to best perform the mapping. Here, we provide a systematic benchmark relevant to correlated materials, in the form of the Anderson impurity model. Overall, we find that a static approximation can be valid and that the moment-based approach recently proposed by Scott and Booth can be a good tool to find the value of the static interaction. We also identify physical regimes, especially under doping, where an instantaneous interaction cannot capture all of the relevant physics."

      "summary": "Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from lexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling. While network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying semantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains challenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on lexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation jump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological Differentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts by analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is applied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD scores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature (cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak correlations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across $\\sim$~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50\\% of the entries in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely independent, definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine similarity becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed from the dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths generated by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP) across networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower cumulative OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces trajectories more coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as measured by OD. Ontological Differentiation thus provides a novel, definition-grounded tool for analyzing, validating, and potentially constructing navigation processes in lexical networks."

Different bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is consistent with a unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality -- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite scenarios, and point out that only the ordinary bipartition purely reflects the criticality of the bulk; otherwise, the extra gapless edge mode will also contribute to the entanglement. We have demonstrated that the correspondence between the entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still approximately persists even at a bulk-gapless point, thereby influencing the behavior of entanglement entropy. Our results establish that boundary conditions induced by the cut are decisive for entanglement-based probes and provide practical protocols to separate bulk from boundary contributions."

Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties."

      "summary": "Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple framework for modeling the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a few impurities or resource sites where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around a resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in a model with one impurity. If memory decays as $1/\\tau$ or slower, where $\\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solution is the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and it is linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are disrupted by possibly long intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence, forgetting can allow the walker to save a lot of memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning process. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting."

      "summary": "Experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moir'e semiconductors can realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir'e valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states. Based on a continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's band structure, focusing on the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity, which can be accessed by gate tuning. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave. Finally, we employ a functional renormalization group approach to also study the competition between density-wave and superconducting instabilities. For twist angles of $\\theta=2.0^\\circ, 2.5^\\circ$, as well as $\\theta\\approx 3.5^\\circ$ -- where the high-order van Hove-singularity is found -- we find clear indications for unconventional superconductivity."

      "summary": "Microstructurally arrested matter, from molecular glasses to soft glassy materials, can retain a memory of their thermal or mechanical (shear) histories. Their history-dependent and nonlinear microstructural recoveries have been studied within the Kovacs framework. Here, we applied the temperature ramps of varying magnitudes to dense colloidal suspensions of thermoresponsive, deformable and compressible microgel particles should serve as an effective strategy to probe the nonlinear path-dependent structural recovery of these systems. We synthesised Poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles using the free radical precipitation polymerisation method. Using oscillatory rheology, we studied the relaxations of the viscoelastic moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions that were heated and cooled at various temperature ramp rates. Path-dependent structural recovery was quantified by studying the asymmetric approach of the suspension elastic modulus toward the target temperature during the heating and cooling temperature ramps. The loss modulus peaks, observed at the times of initiation and termination of the temperature ramps, were understood to arise from energy dissipation due to microgel rearrangement events. The heights of the peaks were found to be inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the elastic response. Our work highlights the important role of energy dissipation through microgel rearrangements in eliminating path-dependent asymmetries in the storage moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions subjected to thermal shocks. By tuning the applied temperature ramp rate and particle packing density, therefore, asymmetric storage modulus relaxations in dense systems can be modulated via adjustments of the accessible free volume."

One of them, APHTZ, is a canted ferroelectric, whereas the other, MPHTZ is a simple antiferroelectric. In APHTZ the electric field, applied perpendicularly to the axis of spontaneous polarization, flips the polarization in one of the two sublattices, effectively rotating the non-zero net polarization by 90$^\\circ$ and switching the system between two different ferroelectric configurations. The temperature-electric field phase diagrams are constructed. The diagram topology appears to be typical for the Ising-like antiferroelectric systems."

The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\\sim$ 77 K temperature window."

However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion."

      "summary": "Many-body effects and quantum criticality play a central role in determining the performance of quantum thermal machines. Although operating near a quantum critical point (QCP) is known to enhance engine performance, the precise thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot efficiency limit remain unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the low-temperature regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the net work output is given by $ W = k_B \\delta \\ln (g_{\\text{crit}}/g_0) $ with $ \\delta = T_H - T_L $, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency $ \\eta_C = 1 - T_L/T_H $, independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency only with a perfect regenerator, here no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the thermal population remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear quantum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate this universal result by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems, including spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively, which converges to classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This analysis establishes a general and robust foundation for designing quantum thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering finite work."

In this work, we fabricate and measure 300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2 ns) and low voltage (<1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors in implementation. Through these results, SOT-MRAM is shown to be a uniquely effective candidate for implementation of crossbar accelerators in memory- and energy-limited applications, able to take advantage of stochastic operation and bi-stability to beneficial results in neural network applications."

The system is immersed in a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators at a constant temperature, where its constituents also interact with the external field. The dynamics is investigated for a sphere and a disk, and is split into two stochastic processes. The first describes the gross-grained inner time-dependent self-velocity generated from a set of independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes without the influence of the external field. This internal mechanism provides the initial velocity for the particle to diffuse in the fluid, which is implemented in a modified generalized Langevin equation as the second process. We find that the system exhibits spontaneous fluctuations in the diffusive velocity modulus due to the inner mechanism; however, as expected, the momentary diffusive velocity fluctuations fade out at large times. The internal propelled velocity module in spherical coordinates is derived, as well as the simulation of the different modules for both the sphere and the already known equations for a disk in polar coordinates."

      "summary": "This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems."

A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene."

From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems."

      "summary": "The Boltzmann distribution for an equilibrium system constrains the statistics of the system by the energetics. Despite the non-equilibrium generalization of the Boltzmann distribution being studied extensively, a unified framework valid for far-from-equilibrium discrete state systems is lacking. Here, we derive an exact path-integral representation for discrete state processes and represent it using the exponential of the action for stochastic transition dynamics. Solving the variational problem, the effective action is shown to be equal to the inferred entropy production rate (a thermodynamic quantity) and a non-quadratic dissipation function of the thermodynamic length (TL) defined for microscopic stochastic currents (a dynamic quantity). This formulates a far-from-equilibrium analog of the Boltzmann distribution, namely, the minimum action principle. The non-quadratic dissipation function is physically attributed to incorporating non-Gaussian fluctuations or far-from-equilibrium non-conservative driving. Further, an exact large deviation dynamical rate functional is derived. The equivalence of the variational formulation with the information geometric formulation is proved. The non-quadratic TL recovers the non-quadratic thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR) and the speed limits, which are tighter than the close-to-equilibrium quadratic formulations. Moreover, if the transition affinities are known, the non-quadratic TL recovers the fluctuation relation (FR). The minimum action principle manifests the non-quadratic TKUR and FR as two faces corresponding to the thermodynamic inference and partial control descriptions, respectively. In addition, the validity of these results is extended to coarse-grained observable currents, strengthening the experimental/numerical applicability of them."

Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated, developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles."

To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix."

Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert the electronic ground state densities for various semiconducting and insulating solids calculated using several density functional approximations within the generalised Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the LDA+$U$ method, and benchmark against standard (semi-)local functionals. The band structures from the resulting local exchange-correlation (LXC) Kohn-Sham potential for these densities are then compared with the band structures of the original GKS method. We find the LXC potential obtained from the HF density systematically predicts band gaps in good agreement with experiment, even in strongly correlated transition metal monoxides (TMOs). Furthermore, we find that the HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals yield similar densities and LXC potentials, and in weakly correlated systems, these potentials are similar to PBE. For LDA+$U$ densities, the LXC potential effectively reverses the flattening of bands caused by over-localisation by a large Hubbard-$U$ value, while for meta-GGAs, we find only small differences between the GKS and LXC results demonstrating that the non-locality of meta-GGAs is weak."

In the absence of self-gravity, the spectrally truncated Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation shows the emergence of Kolmogorov's $5/3$ scaling in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. Introducing self-gravity, we observe the formation of different structures, from sheet-like to spherically collapsed structures, which introduce a minimum in the kinetic energy spectrum that corresponds to the sizes of these structures. The system shows early convergence towards statistically stationary states, which we show by the onset of thermalisation in the compressible kinetic energy spectrum, where $E_{\\rm kin}^c \\propto k^2$. We also show that the formation of such large-scale structures suggests that the particles (bosons) move from small to large scales through an inverse cascade, supporting a mechanism for the formation of large-scale structures, such as dark matter haloes, around our galaxy Milky Way."

      "summary": "-cross Abstract: Machine learning force fields have emerged as promising tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. Inspired by foundational large language models, recent years have seen considerable progress in developing foundational atomistic models, sometimes referred to as universal force fields, designed to cover most elements in the periodic table. This Perspective adopts a practitioner's viewpoint to ask a critical question: Are these foundational atomistic models reliable for one of their most compelling applications, in particular simulating finite-temperature dynamics? Instead of a broad benchmark, we use the canonical ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in PbTiO$_3$ as a focused case study to evaluate prominent foundational atomistic models. Our findings suggest a potential disconnect between static accuracy and dynamic reliability. While 0 K properties are often well-reproduced, we observed that the models can struggle to consistently capture the correct phase transition, sometimes exhibiting simulation instabilities. We believe these challenges may stem from inherent biases in training data and a limited description of anharmonicity. These observed shortcomings, though demonstrated on a single system, appear to point to broader, systemic challenges that can be addressed with targeted fine-tuning. This Perspective serves not to rank models, but to initiate a crucial discussion on the practical readiness of foundational atomistic models and to explore future directions for their improvement."

Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity."

However, conventional intensity polarimetry, which neglects phase information, fails to resolve antiparallel domains and to describe two-dimensional heterostructures, which represent a new class of van der Waals-bound composite crystals. In this work, we report dual-polarization spectral phase interferometry (DP-SPI) and establish a generalized SHG superposition model that incorporates the observables of DP-SPI. Antiparallel domains of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were successfully imaged with distinction, validating the interferometric polarimetry. From DP interferograms of TMD heterobilayers, the orientation of each layer could be determined, enabling layer-resolved probing. By employing the superposition model, we also demonstrate the photonic design and fabrication of ternary TMD heterostructures for circularly polarized SHG. These methods, providing comprehensive SHG measurements and theoretical description, can be extended to heterostructures consisting of more than two constituent layers and are not limited to TMDs or 2D materials."

We highlight that this diagram is fundamentally different from those found in other coupled systems such as in coupled logistic maps or Lorenz systems. Finally, we show an interesting domain-wall phenomenon in the coupled chaotic rotors, where a super-long transient interface state (partially regular and partially chaotic) is observed and can persist exponentially long as the coupling range increases up to a critical threshold."

Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the correlated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to calculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 qubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum computing use case in materials science."

I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties."

Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions."

In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values."

      "summary": "A tunable voltage source with ultralow noise would move the frontier in experimental quantum electronics. The authors have developed a cryogenic superconducting voltage source that provides the same metrological precision as a Josephson voltage standard, while being widely and continuously tunable. They demonstrate how the source can be coupled to quantum circuits, and that it has extremely low noise over a huge voltage range. This tunable Josephson voltage source opens possibilities for observing fresh physical phenomena, and has applications in quantum information and mesoscopic physics. [Phys. Rev.
